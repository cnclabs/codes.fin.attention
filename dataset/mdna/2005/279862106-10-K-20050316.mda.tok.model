item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit facility and note to our consolidated financial statements 
marketing our production is marketed to third parties consistent with industry practices 
we market our own production where feasible  but on occasion engage a third party marketing agent 
typically  oil is sold at the well head at field posted prices and natural gas is sold under contract at a negotiated monthly price based upon factors normally considered in the industry  such as conditioning or treating to make gas marketable  distance from the well to the transportation pipeline  well pressure  estimated reserves  quality of natural gas and prevailing supply demand conditions 
our marketing objective is to receive the highest possible wellhead price for our product 
we are aided by the presence of multiple outlets near our production on the gulf coast 
we take an active role in determining the available pipeline alternatives for each property based upon historical pricing  capacity  pressure  market relationships  seasonal variances and long term viability 
there are a variety of factors which affect the market for oil and natural gas  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas  the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  demand for oil and natural gas  the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and federal regulations on oil and natural gas production and sales 
we have not experienced any significant difficulties in marketing our oil and natural gas 
the oil and natural gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial  commercial and individual customers 
where feasible  we use a combination of market sensitive pricing and forward fixed pricing 
forward pricing is utilized to take advantage of anomalies in the futures market and to hedge a portion of our production at prices exceeding forecast 
all such hedging transactions provide for financial rather than physical settlement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates derivatives and hedging activities 
due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  we may enter into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also reduces our potential exposure to adverse price movements 
our price risk management arrangements  to the extent we enter into any  apply to only a portion of our production  provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limit our potential gains from future increases in prices 
on a quarterly basis  our management sets all of our price risk management transaction policies  including volumes  accounting treatment  types of instruments and counter parties 
these policies are implemented by management through the execution of trades by the chief financial officer after consultation with and concurrence by the president and chairman of the board 
our board of directors reviews our price risk management policies and trades 
we account for these transactions as hedging and derivative activities and  accordingly  certain gains and losses are included in revenue during the period the transactions occur see note to our consolidated financial statements 
although we take some measures to attempt to control price risk  we remain subject to price fluctuations for natural gas sold in the spot market due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond our control 
domestic oil prices generally follow worldwide oil prices  which are subject to price fluctuations resulting from changes in world supply and demand 
we continue to evaluate the potential for reducing these risks by entering into hedge transactions

therefore one counterparty is presented in the derivative asset and one is presented in the derivative liability 
the crude oil collar with a balance of  is presented as a liability and the remaining contracts are presented as an asset 
all contracts are considered current 
sales to major customers we sold natural gas and crude oil production representing or more of our total revenues for the years ended december    and as listed below 
for the year ended december  major purchaser upstream energy services chevrontexaco copano field services bta southwestern energy note amounts disclosed are approximations and those that are less than are presented for information and comparison purposes only 
also these percentages do not consider the effects of financial hedges 
upstream is an agent that sells our production to other purchasers on our behalf 
in the exploration  development and production business  production is normally sold to relatively few customers 
substantially all of the company s customers are concentrated in the oil and gas industry  and revenue can be materially affected by current economic conditions and the price of certain commodities such as natural gas and crude oil  the cost of which is passed through to the customer 
however  based on the current demand for natural gas and crude oil and the fact that alternate purchasers are readily available  we believe that the loss of any of our major purchasers would not have a long term material adverse effect on our operations 
competition we encounter competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all areas of our operations  including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties 
our ability to explore for oil and natural gas reserves and to acquire additional properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability to conduct our operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
we believe that our technological expertise  our exploration  land  drilling and production capabilities and the experience of our management generally enable us to compete effectively 
see items and business and properties risk factors we face strong competition from larger oil and natural gas companies 
industry regulations the availability of a ready market for oil and natural gas production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of oil and natural gas production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  state limits on allowable rates of production by well or proration unit  the amount of oil and natural gas available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas  protect rights to produce oil and natural gas between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of oil and natural gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies 
we are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws  the effects of which cannot be predicted 
the following discussion summarizes the regulation of the united states oil and natural gas industry 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the various statutes  rules  regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject  although there can be no assurance that this is or will remain the case 
moreover  such statutes  rules  regulations and government orders may be changed or reinterpreted from time to time in response to economic or political conditions  and there can be no assurance that such changes or reinterpretations will not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various statutes  rules  regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject 
regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in areas where pooling is voluntary  it may be more difficult to form units  and therefore more difficult to develop a project  if the operator owns less than percent of the leasehold 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
the effect of these regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our costs of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
inasmuch such laws and regulations are frequently expanded  amended and interpreted  we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations 
regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas 
federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of natural gas produced by us  and the manner in which such production is transported and marketed 
under the natural gas act nga of  the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas 
effective january   the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas  including all sales by us of our own production 
as a result  all of our domestically produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices  subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect 
however  the decontrol act did not affect the ferc s jurisdiction over natural gas transportation 
our natural gas sales are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation 
following the congressional passage of the ngpa  the ferc adopted a series of regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas 
beginning with the adoption of order no 
 issued in october  the ferc has implemented a series of major restructuring orders that have required pipelines  among other things  to perform open access transportation of gas for others  unbundle their sales and transportation functions  and allow shippers to release their unneeded capacity temporarily and permanently to other shippers 
as a result of these changes  sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties 
we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while  at the same time  substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 
it remains to be seen  however  what effect the ferc s other activities will have on access to markets  the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business 
we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt  or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities 
we do not believe that we will be affected by any such new or different regulations materially differently than any other seller of natural gas with which we compete 
in the past  congress has been very active in the area of gas regulation 
however  as discussed above  the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation  or lighter handed regulation  and the promotion of competition in the gas industry 
there regularly are other legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures that  if enacted  would significantly affect the petroleum industry 
at the present time  it is impossible to predict what proposals  if any  might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect  if any  such proposals might have on us 
similarly  and despite the trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry  whether or to what extent that trend will continue  or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas  cannot be predicted 
again  we do not believe that we will be affected by any such new legislative proposals materially differently than any other seller of natural gas with which we compete 
we own certain natural gas pipelines that we believe meet the standards the ferc has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga 
state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental  and in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements  but does not generally entail rate regulation 
natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both state and federal levels in the post restructuring environment 
oil price controls and transportation rates 
sales of crude oil  condensate and gas liquids by us are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the price we receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market 
much of the transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines 
effective as of january   the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
these regulations have generally been approved on judicial review 
every five years  the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry 
the first such review was completed in  and on december   ferc reaffirmed the current index 
the ferc s regulation of oil transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipelines  although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year 
following a successful court challenge of these orders by an association of oil pipelines on february   the ferc acting on remand increased the index slightly for the current five year period  effective july we are not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations  if any  on the transportation costs associated with oil production from our oil producing operations 
environmental regulations 
our operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as pit closure and plugging abandoned wells  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from production and drilling operations 
public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years 
the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry could continue  resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly waste handling  disposal and cleanup requirements  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
we generate wastes that may be subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
the us environmental protection agency epa and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 
furthermore  certain wastes generated by our oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes  and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements 
we currently own or lease numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas 
although we believe that we have used good operating and waste disposal practices  prior owners and operators of these properties may not have used similar practices  and hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  rcra and analogous state laws as well as state laws governing the management of oil and natural gas wastes 
under such laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
our operations may be subject to the clean air act caa and comparable state and local requirements 
amendments to the caa were adopted in and contain provisions that have resulted in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations 
the epa and states developed and continue to develop regulations to implement these requirements 
we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission related issues 
however  we do not believe our operations will be materially adversely affected by any such requirements 
federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil  such as edge  to prepare and implement spill prevention  control  countermeasure spcc and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters 
spcc plans at our producing properties were developed and implemented in the oil pollution act of opa contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the united states 
the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill  including  but not limited to  the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 
noncompliance with opa may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities 
our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act cwa and analogous state laws 
in accordance with the cwa  the state of louisiana has issued regulations prohibiting discharges of produced water in state coastal waters effective july  pursuant to other requirements of the cwa  the epa has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff 
this program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits  participate in a group permit or seek coverage under an epa general permit 
while certain of our properties may require permits for discharges of storm water runoff  we believe that we will be able to obtain  or be included under  such permits  where necessary  and make minor modifications to existing facilities and operations that would not have a material effect on us 
like opa  the cwa and analogous state laws relating to the control of water pollution provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities for releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground 
cercla  also known as the superfund law  and similar state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under cercla may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we also are subject to a variety of federal  state and local permitting and registration requirements relating to protection of the environment 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements would not have a material adverse effect on us 
operating hazards and insurance the oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks  including the risk of fire  explosion  blow out  pipe failure  casing collapse  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills  natural gas leaks  ruptures and discharges of toxic gases  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  cleanup responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
our insurance does not cover business interruption or protect against loss of revenue 
there can be no assurance that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
risk factors oil and gas drilling is a speculative activity and involves numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs which could adversely affect us 
our growth will be materially dependent upon the success of our future drilling program 
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment 
our future drilling activities may not be successful and  if unsuccessful  such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline 
we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame  or at all 
we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because  in some cases  we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location 
similarly  our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget 
the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors  including the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition  review and analysis of the seismic data  the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects  the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews  our financial resources and results  and the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects 
these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells  if drilled  may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive oil or natural gas 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations industry and economic factors and items and business and properties core areas of operation 
oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile in general and low prices negatively affect our financial results 
our revenue  profitability  cash flow  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
our reserves are predominantly natural gas  therefore changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 
lower oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and such markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of foreign imports and overall economic conditions 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  and ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations derivatives and hedging activities and items and business and properties oil and natural gas reserves and marketing 
we have in the past and may in the future be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or unusually volatile 
whether we will be required to take such a charge will depend on the prices for oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter and the effect of reserve additions or revisions and capital expenditures during such quarter 
if a write down is required  it would result in a charge to earnings and would not impact cash flow from operating activities 
we have hedged and may continue to hedge a portion of our production  which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and gas 
in order to reduce our exposure to short term fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas  we periodically enter into hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices 
such hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected  our customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of oil or natural gas or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
in addition  our hedging arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations derivatives and hedging activities and items and business and properties marketing 
we depend on successful exploration  development and acquisitions to maintain reserves and revenue in the future 
in general  the volume of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics 
except to the extent we acquire properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  or both  our proved reserves will decline 
our future oil and natural gas production is  therefore  highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
in addition  we are dependent on finding partners for our exploratory activity 
to the extent that others in the industry do not have the financial resources or choose not to participate in our exploration activities  we could be adversely affected 
we are subject to substantial operating risks that may adversely affect the results of our operations 
the oil and natural gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  mechanical failures  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
we could suffer substantial losses as a result of any of these events 
we are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business 
we are not the operator of some of our wells 
as a result  our operating risks for those wells and our ability to influence the operations for these wells are less subject to our control 
operators of these wells may act in ways that are not in our best interests 
see items and business and properties operating hazards and insurance 
we cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate and are unable to ensure their proper operation and profitability 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over  and control the risks associated with  operations of these properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  an operator s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues 
the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the operator s timing and amount of capital expenditures  expertise and financial resources  inclusion of other participants in drilling wells  and use of technology 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect us 
we depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel  including our executive officers and other key employees  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our employees 
we believe that our success is also dependent upon our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel 
see items and business and properties technology 
our operations have significant capital requirements which  if not met  will hinder operations 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial working capital needs due to our active exploration  development and acquisition programs 
additional financing may be required in the future to fund our growth 
we may not be able to obtain such additional financing and financing under existing or new credit facilities may not be available in the future 
in the event such capital resources are not available to us  our drilling and other activities may be curtailed 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
government regulation and liability for environmental matters may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal  state and local government regulations  which may be changed from time to time 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
from time to time  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas 
there are federal  state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment applicable to the development  production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of oil and natural gas  by products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations 
in addition  we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities 
we are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws  the effects of which cannot be predicted 
the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us 
see items and business and properties industry regulations 
we may have difficulty managing any future growth and the related demands on our resources and may have difficulty in achieving future growth 
we have experienced growth in the past through the expansion of our drilling program and  more recently  acquisitions 
this expansion was curtailed in and  but resumed in and increased in subsequent years 
further expansion is anticipated in both through increased drilling efforts and possible acquisitions 
any future growth may place a significant strain on our financial  technical  operational and administrative resources 
our ability to grow will depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to identify and acquire new exploratory prospects  our ability to develop existing prospects  our ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel  the results of our drilling program and acquisition efforts  hydrocarbon prices and access to capital 
we may not be successful in achieving or managing growth and any such failure could have a material adverse effect on us 
we face strong competition from larger oil and natural gas companies 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we encounter competition from oil and natural gas companies in all areas of our operations  including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties 
our competitors range in size from the major integrated oil and natural gas companies to numerous independent oil and natural gas companies  individuals and drilling and income programs 
many of these competitors are large  well established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than us 
we may not be able to successfully conduct our operations  evaluate and select suitable properties  consummate transactions  and obtain technical  managerial and other professional personnel in this highly competitive environment 
specifically  these larger competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects  productive oil and natural gas properties and competent personnel and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
in addition  such competitors may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 
see items and business and properties competition 
the oil and natural gas reserve data included in or incorporated by reference in this document are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and existing economic and operating conditions that may differ from future economic and operating conditions 
reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner and is based upon assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results 
accordingly  reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward adjustment 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
the information regarding discounted future net cash flows included in this report should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  increases or decreases in consumption  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by financial accounting standards board in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about oil and natural gas producing activities to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
see items and business and properties oil and natural gas reserves 
our credit facility has substantial operating restrictions and financial covenants and we may have difficulty obtaining additional credit  which could adversely affect operations 
over the past few years  increases in commodity prices  in proved reserve amounts and the resultant increase in estimated discounted future net revenue  has allowed us to increase our available borrowing amounts 
in the future  commodity prices may decline  we may increase our borrowings or our borrowing base may be adjusted downward 
our credit facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and has covenants that limit additional borrowings  sales of assets and the distributions of cash or properties and that prohibit the payment of dividends and the incurrence of liens 
the revolving credit facility also requires that specified financial ratios be maintained 
the restrictions of our credit facility and the difficulty in obtaining additional debt financing may have adverse consequences on our operations and financial results  including our ability to obtain financing for working capital  capital expenditures  our drilling program  purchases of new technology or other purposes 
in addition  such financing may be on terms unfavorable to us and we may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities 
further  a substantial decrease in our operating cash flow or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet debt service requirements and require us to modify operations and we may become more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy generally 
our ability to obtain and service indebtedness will depend on our future performance  including our ability to manage cash flow and working capital  which are in turn subject to a variety of factors beyond our control 
our business may not generate cash flow at or above anticipated levels or we may not be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service indebtedness  make anticipated capital expenditures or finance our drilling program 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt  we may be required to curtail portions of our drilling program  sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing  particularly in view of current industry conditions  the restrictions on our ability to incur debt under our existing debt arrangements  and the fact that substantially all of our assets are currently pledged to secure obligations under our bank credit facility

we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cast of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our acquisition program may be unsuccessful 
acquisitions have become increasingly important to our business strategy in recent years 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors 
such assessments  even when performed by experienced personnel  are necessarily inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain 
our review of subject properties will not reveal all existing or potential problems  deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not always perform inspections on every well  and may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we undertake an inspection 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of such problems 
any acquisition of property interests by us may not be successful and  if unsuccessful  such failure may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
we do not intend to pay dividends and our ability to pay dividends is restricted 
we currently intend to retain any earnings for the future operation and development of our business and do not currently anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we are currently restricted from paying dividends by our existing credit facility agreement 
any future dividends also may be restricted by our then existing loan agreements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our reliance on third parties for gathering and distributing could curtail future exploration and production activities 
the marketability of our production depends upon the proximity of our reserves to  and the capacity of  facilities and third party services  including oil and natural gas gathering systems  pipelines  trucking or terminal facilities  and processing facilities 
the unavailability or lack of capacity of such services and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
a shut in or delay or discontinuance could adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation affect our ability to produce and market our oil and natural gas on a profitable basis 
provisions of delaware law and our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that would benefit stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of the company 
these provisions  among other things  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms  restrict the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent  authorize the board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock  and restrict our ability to engage in transactions with stockholders 
because of these provisions  persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non negotiated takeover attempts 
as a result  these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors

general overview edge petroleum corporation edge or the company is a houston based independent energy company that focuses its exploration  production and marketing activities in selected onshore basins of the united states 
in late  we undertook a top level management change and began a shift in strategy from pure exploration  which focused more on prospect generation  to our current strategy which focuses on a balanced program of exploration  exploitation and development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
our company generates revenues  income and cash flows by producing and marketing oil and natural gas produced from our oil and natural gas properties 
we make significant capital expenditures in our exploration  development  and acquisition activities that allow us to continue generating revenue  income and cash flows 
in december  we acquired percent of the outstanding stock of miller exploration company miller 
the transaction was treated as a tax free reorganization and accounted for as a purchase business combination 
miller continues to conduct exploration and development activities as a wholly owned subsidiary of edge 
in december  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of contango oil gas company contango for a cash purchase price  financed by proceeds from a public offering of our common stock 
this acquisition is hereinafter referred to as the contango asset acquisition

recently issued accounting pronouncements a discussion of certain accounting pronouncements recently issued that may impact our future results 
industry and economic factors in managing our business  we must deal with many factors inherent in our industry 
first and foremost is the fluctuation of oil and gas prices 
historically  oil and gas markets have been cyclical and volatile  with future price movements  which are difficult to predict 
while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  it is wide swings in prices that have most often had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
we have no way to predict those prices or to control them without losing some advantage of the upside potential 
our operations entail significant complexities 
advanced technologies requiring highly trained personnel are utilized in both exploration and production 
even when the technology is properly used  we may still not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present or the rate at which they will be produced 
exploration is a high risk activity  often times resulting in no commercially productive reserves being discovered 
moreover  costs associated with operating within our industry are substantial 
our business  as with other extractive industries  is a depleting one in which each gas equivalent produced must be replaced or we  and a critical source of our future liquidity  will shrink 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major and diversified energy companies  independent oil and gas businesses and individual operators in exploration  production  marketing and acquisition activities 
in addition  the industry as a whole competes with other businesses that supply energy to industrial and commercial end users 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our activities are subject to stringent environmental regulations 
these regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and gas wells and related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
approach to the business profitable growth of our business will largely depend upon our ability to successfully find and develop new proved reserves of oil and natural gas in a cost effective manner 
in order to achieve an overall acceptable rate of growth  we seek to maintain a prudent blend of low  moderate and higher risk exploration and development projects 
we also attempt to make selected acquisitions of oil and gas properties to augment our growth and provide future drilling opportunities 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
we periodically hedge our exposure to volatile oil and gas prices on a portion of our production to manage price risk 
as of december   we have entered into hedge contracts covering approximately and of our anticipated natural gas and crude oil production  respectively  before any acquisitions 
implementation of our business approach relies on our ability to fund ongoing exploration and development projects with cash flow provided by operating activities and external sources of capital 
in late  we announced plans for record capital expenditures of approximately million for  which was subsequently expanded to million 
our board recently approved a capital budget of million 
based on current expectations for production volumes and commodity prices  we expect to fund those capital expenditures from internally generated cash from operating activities 
we do not typically include acquisitions in our budgeted capital expenditures  but expect to fund those with either borrowings under our credit facility or offerings of common stock or other securities under our shelf registration statement or other sources 
in  edge reported a increase in proved reserves over the period  including the effect of the contango asset acquisition see acquisitions and divestitures below  and a increase in annual production volumes over the period 
we also replaced of our total production see items and business and properties oil and natural gas reserve replacement 
production in the fourth quarter was higher than in the previous quarter and we exited with a record daily production rate of mmcfe d as compared to mmcfe d a year ago 
we believe that a strong financial position as represented by a debt to total capital ratio of  available unused borrowing capacity and increased cash flow from our growing production volumes as a result of successful drilling and the contango asset acquisition completed in december will help lay the ground work for our activities in operationally and financially  we believe we are well positioned to continue the execution of our business strategy during acquisitions and divestitures acquisitions we have become increasingly active in acquisitions in recent years 
we have looked to acquisitions to enable us to achieve our desired growth and we expect acquisitions will continue to play a significant role in our future plans for growth 
on december   we completed our acquisition of miller 
miller was an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with exploration efforts concentrated primarily in the mississippi salt basin of central mississippi 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each share of issued and outstanding common stock of miller was converted into shares of edge common stock 
we issued approximately million shares of edge common stock to the shareholders of miller in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of miller 
the merger was treated as a tax free reorganization and accounted for as a purchase business combination under generally accepted accounting principles 
we operate the majority of the acquired properties 
we acquired miller for the development and exploitation projects in miller s core area  increased financial flexibility  and expansion of our core areas 
during  we realized much of the exploitable potential of the miller properties and will continue to focus on these opportunities in on october   we executed an asset purchase agreement to acquire oil and natural gas properties located in south texas from contango for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
the purchase price was subject to adjustment for the results of operations between the july  effective date and the december  closing date 
the purchase price was preliminarily adjusted to million at closing for the results of operations between the july  effective date and october  in addition  at december  a further downward adjustment of million was accrued for the results of operations for november  through december   which we anticipate realizing in march  pursuant to the post closing adjustments provision 
we financed the acquisition with proceeds from a public offering of our common stock under our current shelf registration see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the properties acquired consist of non operated producing wells with working interests ranging from approximately to and net revenue interests ranging from to 
these properties  located primarily in jim hogg county  texas and producing primarily from the queen city formation  are in a geographic area that has been one of our most active and successful areas of focus in recent years 
in addition to estimated proved reserves  our technical team has also identified a substantial number of additional drilling locations on undeveloped acreage with attractive exploitation and exploration potential  therefore  we allocated million of the purchase price to the unproved property category 
divestitures we regularly review our asset base for the purpose of identifying non core assets  the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies 
while we generally do not dispose of assets solely for the purpose of reducing debt  such dispositions can have the result of furthering our objective of financial flexibility through reduced debt levels 
during  and  our divestitures consisted of the sales of oil and gas properties for net proceeds of   and  respectively 
our net proceeds from asset divestitures were primarily derived from the sale of certain oil and gas properties and equipment in texas and louisiana 
our net proceeds from asset divestitures were primarily derived from the sale of our interest in two affiliated entities  essex i and ii joint ventures  and certain oil and gas properties in texas and louisiana 
our divestitures were primarily derived from the sale of certain interests in oil and gas properties in texas  alabama  montana  and louisiana 
outlook we completed a significant asset acquisition and a public offering of common stock at the end of we expect to continue to spend considerable effort in on acquisitions  as we seek to further our growth 
we expect our drilling program to increase from wells net in to approximately to wells to net in our expected capital program  excluding acquisitions  will be approximately million  approximately greater than the approved program 
our expected production volumes combined with a strong commodity pricing environment  that if sustained  is anticipated to produce another year of record cash flow 
in order to manage our realized growth in and our anticipated growth for the next several years  we increased our headcount from employees as of december  to employees as of december  resulting in increased g a costs for we expect to add to our staff levels again in both as a result of past growth and anticipated future growth 
to help protect against the possibility of downward commodity price movements  we have entered into several hedges covering approximately of our expected natural gas production and of our expected crude oil production streams for our outlook and the expected results described above are both subject to change based upon factors that include but are not limited to drilling results  commodity prices  access to capital  the acquisitions market and factors referred to in forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  contingent assets and liabilities and the related disclosures in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
all other significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion presents information about the nature of our most critical accounting estimates  our assumptions or approach used and the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate 
nature of critical estimate item oil natural gas reserves our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in the future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the economics of producing the reserves may change and therefore the estimate of proved reserves also may change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
assumptions approach used units of production method to amortize our oil and natural gas properties the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our depletion expense 
any reduction in proved reserves without a corresponding reduction in capitalized costs will increase the depletion rate 
ceiling test the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties requires a quarterly calculation of a limitation on capitalized costs  often referred to as a full cost ceiling calculation 
the ceiling is the discounted present value of our estimated total proved reserves adjusted for taxes and the impact of hedges on pricing  using a discount rate 
to the extent that our capitalized costs net of accumulated depletion and deferred taxes exceed the ceiling  the excess must be written off to expense 
once incurred  this impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase 
no such impairment was required in the years ended december    and this calculation of our proved reserves could significantly impact our ceiling limitation used in determining whether an impairment of our capitalized costs is necessary 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are generally held constant indefinitely 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs  but rather are based on prices and costs in effect as of the end of the period 
oil and natural gas prices used in the reserve valuation at december  were per barrel and per mmbtu 
effect if different assumptions used units of production method to amortize our oil and natural gas properties a decrease in reserves would have increased our depletion expense for the year by  however  a increase in our reserves would have decreased our depletion expense for the year by ceiling limitation test the most likely factor to contribute to a ceiling test impairment is the price used to calculate the reserve limitation threshold 
a significant reduction in the prices at a future measurement date could trigger a full cost ceiling impairment 
at december   we had a cushion ie the excess of the ceiling over our capitalized costs of million 
a increase or decrease in prices used would have increased or decreased our cushion by approximately 
our hedging program would serve to mitigate some of the impact of any price decline 
our hedges did not impact the ceiling test in the fourth quarter  and would not have if the price was higher as these prices were within the collars  but had we decreased the price by the price would have been less than our hedge floor and therefore resulted in a decrease in the ceiling of million 
another likely factor to contribute to a ceiling test impairment is a revised estimate of reserve volume 
a increase or decrease in reserve volume would have increased or decreased our cushion by approximately 
nature of critical estimate item unproved property impairment we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our oil and gas activities 
investments in unproved properties are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the properties can be determined or until impairment occurs 
unproved properties are evaluated quarterly for impairment on a property by property basis 
if the results of an assessment indicate that an unproved property is impaired  the amount of impairment is added to the proved oil and natural gas property costs to be amortized 
assumptions approach used at december   we had million allocated to unproved property 
this allocation is based on the estimation by the technical team of whether the property has potential attributable reserves 
therefore  the assessment made by our technical team of the potential reserves will determine whether costs are moved from the unproved category to the full cost pool for depletion or whether an impairment is taken 
effect if different assumptions used a increase or decrease in the unproved property balance ie transfer to full cost pool would have increased or decreased our depletion expense by for the year ended december  nature of critical estimate item asset retirement obligations we have certain obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
previously  the costs associated with this activity were capitalized to the full cost pool and charged to income through depletion 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations effective january   as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets asset retirement obligations or aro 
primarily  the new statement requires us to estimate asset retirement costs for all of our assets  inflation adjust those costs to the forecast abandonment date  discount that amount using a credit adjusted risk free rate back to the date we acquired the asset or obligation to retire the asset and record an aro liability in that amount with a corresponding addition to our asset value 
we then accrete the liability quarterly using the period end effective credit adjusted risk free rate 
as new wells are drilled or purchased  their initial asset retirement cost and liability is calculated and recorded 
should either the estimated life or the estimated abandonment costs of a property change upon our quarterly review  a new calculation is performed using the same methodology of taking the abandonment cost and inflating it forward to its abandonment date and then discounting it back to the present using our credit adjusted risk free rate 
the carrying value of the asset retirement obligation is adjusted to the newly calculated value  with a corresponding offsetting adjustment to the asset retirement cost included in the full cost pool  therefore  abandonment costs will almost always approximate the estimate 
when wells are sold the related liability and asset costs are removed from the balance sheet 
assumptions approach used estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the estimate of the present value calculation of our aros are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted risk free rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
effect if different assumptions used since there are so many variables in estimating aros  we attempt to limit the impact of management s judgment on certain of these variables by using input of qualified third parties 
we engage an independent engineering firm to evaluate our properties annually 
we use the remaining estimated useful life from the year end reserve reports by our independent reserve engineer in estimating when abandonment could be expected for each property 
we utilize a three year average rate for inflation to diminish any significant volatility that may be present in the short term 
we expect to see our calculations impacted significantly if interest rates move from their current lows  as the credit adjusted risk free rate is one of the variables used on a quarterly basis 
our technical team developed a standard cost estimate based on historical costs  industry quotes and depth of wells 
unless we expect a well s plugging to be significantly different than a normal abandonment  we use this estimate 
the resulting estimate  after application of a discount factor and some significant calculations  could differ from actual results  despite all our efforts to make an accurate estimate 
nature of critical estimate item income taxes in accordance with the accounting for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have recorded a deferred tax asset and liability to account for the expected future tax benefits and consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
there are several items that result in deferred tax asset and liability impact to the balance sheet  but the largest of which is income taxes and the impact of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
we routinely assess the realizability of our nol carryforwards that resulted from substantial income tax deductions  prior year losses and acquisitions 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  it is reduced by a valuation allowance 
assumptions approach used numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 
the company is not currently required to pay any federal income taxes because of nol carryforwards 
effect if different assumptions used we have engaged an independent public accounting firm to assist us in applying the numerous and complicated tax law requirements 
however  despite our attempt to make an accurate estimate  the ultimate utilization of our nol carryforwards is highly dependent upon our actual production and the realization of taxable income in future periods 
if we estimate that some or all of our nol carryforwards are more likely than not going to expire or otherwise not be utilized to reduce future tax  we would record a valuation allowance to remove the benefit of those nol carryforwards from our financial statements 
nature of critical estimate item derivative hedging activities due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  we may enter into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from commodity price fluctuations 
while all of these transactions are economic hedges of price risk  different accounting treatment may apply depending on if they qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended  all transactions are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
see items and business and properties marketing 
hedge contracts we formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used for hedging are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged transactions 
in the event it is determined that the use of a particular derivative may not be or has ceased to be effective in pursuing a hedging strategy  hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively 
the ongoing measurement of effectiveness determines whether the change in fair value is deferred through other comprehensive income oci on the balance sheet or recorded immediately in revenue on the income statement 
the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of hedge contracts is recorded initially in oci 
when the hedged production is sold  the realized gains and losses on the hedge contracts are removed from oci and recorded in revenue 
ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of the hedge contracts are recognized in revenue as they occur 
while the hedge contract is outstanding  the ineffective gain or loss may increase or decrease until settlement of the contract 
derivative contracts for transactions not accounted for using cash flow hedge accounting  the change in the fair value of the derivative contract is reflected in revenue immediately  ie not deferred through oci  and there is no measurement of effectiveness 
assumptions approach used estimating the fair values of derivative instruments requires complex calculations  including the use of a discounted cash flow technique  estimates of risk and volatility  and subjective judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate 
in addition  the calculations use future market commodity prices  which although posted for trading purposes  are merely the market consensus of forecasted price trends 
the results of the fair value calculations cannot be expected to represent exactly the fair value of our commodity hedges 
we currently obtain the fair value of our positions from our counterparties 
our practice of relying on our counterparties who are more specialized and knowledgeable in preparing these complex calculations reduces our management s input 
effect if different assumptions used at december   a change in the commodity price per unit  as long as the price is either above the ceiling or below the floor price  would cause the fair value total of our derivative financial instrument to increase or decrease by approximately results of operations this section includes discussion of our  and results of operations 
we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and production of oil and natural gas 
our resources and assets are managed and our results reported as one operating segment 
we conduct our operations primarily along the onshore united states  gulf coast  with our primary emphasis in south texas  louisiana and southeastern new mexico 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production total revenue increased from to for the years ended december  and  our product mix contributed the following percentages of production and revenues revenues production natural gas mcf natural gas liquids bbls crude oil bbl total mcfe includes effect of hedging and derivative transactions 
the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenue for our oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period compared to period december  increase increase decrease decrease production volumes natural gas mcf natural gas liquids bbls oil and condensate bbls natural gas equivalent mcfe average sales price natural gas per mcf natural gas liquids per bbl oil and condensate per bbl natural gas equivalent per mcfe operating revenue natural gas natural gas liquids oil and condensate loss on hedging and derivatives total excludes the effect of hedging and derivative transactions 
includes the effect of hedging and derivative transactions 
our revenue is sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
a substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices  which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have a dramatic effect on the prices we receive for our production 
political instability  availability of alternative fuels  the economy  weather and other factors outside of our control could impact supply and demand 
several of these factors  including instability in the middle east  lower inventories and a cold winter contributed to commodity price increases in natural gas revenue  excluding hedging activity  increased for the year ended december  over the same period in due to significantly higher production and higher realized prices 
average natural gas production increased from mmcf d in to mmcf d in due to production from new wells drilled  primarily in our gato creek and encinitas locations  and those acquired at the end of  including the miller and south texas properties 
partially offsetting the increases in production were natural declines at our o connor ranch and o connor ranch east properties  as well as declines due to increased salt water production on the thibodeaux well 
the overall increase in production compared to the prior year period resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period pre hedge prices 
excluding the effect of hedges  the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf compared to per mcf for this increase in average price received resulted in increased revenue of approximately million based on current year production 
revenue from the sale of ngls increased for the year ended december  over the same period in production volumes for ngls increased  from bbls d for to bbls d for due primarily to increased production from new wells drilled at gato creek  encinitas  santellana  and southeast new mexico  those acquired at year end from miller and in south texas  and new processing and treating agreements entered into during our production at gato creek receives a lower average price on ngl s approximately per barrel due to the terms of our marketing agreement for that area 
in  the majority of our ngl production came from gato creek  whereas in we have added more market priced production that has increased our overall price realized 
the increase in ngl production increased revenue by approximately million based on comparable period average prices 
higher average realized prices for the year ended december  resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on current year production 
the average realized price for ngls for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel for the same period in revenue from the sale of oil and condensate  excluding derivative activity  increased for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable prior year period in due to increased production and realized prices 
production volumes for oil and condensate increased to bbls d for the year ended december  compared to bbls d for the same prior year period due primarily to production from the properties acquired from miller and in south texas  as well as new wells drilled during at our encinitas  gato creek and southeast new mexico properties 
the increase in oil and condensate production resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period average prices 
the average realized price for oil and condensate before the derivative losses for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel in the same period of these higher average prices for resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on current year production 
losses on hedging and derivatives decreased for the year ended december  over the same period in due to better alignment of hedge and derivative contracts with market pricing 
the volume and price contract terms vary from period to period and therefore interact differently with the market prices 
while we are unable to predict the market prices  we enter into contracts that we expect will protect us in the event of significant downturns in the market 
oil and condensate revenues were decreased by realized and unrealized losses on our oil derivatives 
for the year ended december  we recorded  of realized losses on oil derivatives settlements and  of unrealized losses representing the change in the mark to market fair value of our outstanding oil derivative contracts 
we did not apply hedge accounting to these transactions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these losses account for a per barrel decrease in the overall realized oil price for the year ended december  from per barrel to per barrel 
there was no oil derivative activity during should crude oil prices decrease from the current levels  we would realize lower revenues from sales of crude oil  but our oil derivative losses would also decrease and could possibly result in a gain position 
the actual pricing will also impact our cash outlay as these transactions settle throughout the year 
for the year ended december   we recognized the  premium paid for a natural gas hedge entered into in and  representing realized losses from natural gas hedging contract settlements 
these losses decreased the effective natural gas sales price by per mcf 
included within revenue for the year ended december  was million representing realized losses from natural gas hedging contract settlements 
these losses decreased the effective natural gas sales price by per mcf for should natural gas prices decrease from the current high levels  this could materially affect our revenues that are not hedged 
costs and operating expenses the table below presents a detail of our and expenses period compared to period december  increase increase decrease decrease lease operating expenses severance and ad valorem taxes depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion oil and gas property and equipment other assets aro accretion general and administrative deferred compensation repriced options deferred compensation restricted stock other general and administrative other expense  net total lease operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in the same period of  an increase of 
current year results were impacted by the addition of the miller and south texas properties acquisitions late in and the drilling of successful wells during operating expenses averaged per mcfe for the year ended december  compared to per mcfe for the prior year period 
severance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended december  increased over severance tax expense for was higher than the prior year period as a result of higher revenue 
severance taxes are levied directly off of our revenue dollar  so the increase is consistent with the increase in revenue 
the rate realized for the year also increased as a result of the changing mix of our production locations 
we had a significant portion of production in other states such as louisiana in as compared to the increase in production in texas in  which imposes a tax rate of approximately of the revenue dollar 
for the year ended december   severance tax expense was approximately of total revenue compared to of total revenue for the comparable period 
ad valorem costs decreased since as a result of adjustments to expense estimates accrued in on an equivalent basis  severance and ad valorem taxes averaged per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively 
dd a and accretion expense for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december  full cost depletion on our oil and natural gas properties totaled million for compared to million in due to both increases in production and the depletion rate 
for the year ended december   higher oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
depletion expense on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe  higher than the rate of per mcfe 
the higher depletion rate per mcfe resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to a higher amortizable base in compared to the prior year without a corresponding increase in reserves 
depreciation of other assets decreased since due to accelerating depreciation on leasehold improvements and computer equipment in when we moved to a new office building early in  we fully depreciated certain assets that would no longer be in service in the new location 
many older assets became fully depreciated at that time and were not replaced in accretion expense on our aro liability has increased for the addition of new obligations associated with wells added during  as well as the fact that accretion is calculated using the interest method of allocation  which calculates interest on the cumulative balance such that the interest increases with each subsequent period 
total general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to the prior year total of million 
total g a costs include deferred compensation related to repriced options  deferred compensation related to restricted stock grants and other g a costs 
deferred compensation expense consists of costs reported in accordance with fin and amortization related to restricted stock awards 
fin requires variable accounting for stock options with terms modified after issuance see note to our consolidated financial statements 
variable accounting provides for a non cash charge to compensation expense if the price of our common stock on the last trading day of a reporting period is greater than the exercise price of certain re priced options 
fin could also result in a credit to compensation expense to the extent that the trading price declines from the trading price as of the end of the prior period  but not below the exercise price of the options 
we adjust deferred compensation expense upward or downward on a monthly basis based on the trading price at the end of each such period 
we are required to report under this rule as a result of non qualified stock options granted to employees and directors in prior years and re priced in may of  as well as certain newly issued options in conjunction with the re pricing 
a fin charge on our re priced stock options was required in both and as a result of our stock price exceeding the exercise price of those re priced options 
the increase in deferred compensation for restricted stock awards is related to the increase in employee headcount during other g a expenses for the year ended december   which does not include the deferred compensation expenses discussed above increased since the increase in other g a was in part attributable to the growth in our company from employees at december  to employees at december  we were also impacted by higher audit and legal fees and amounts spent on investor relations projects during we incurred approximately  of costs for the implementation of the sarbanes oxley internal control report during this does not include any amounts of the significant internal resources that were directed towards this project 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in general office related spending in included in was a  settlement for a lawsuit related to seismic rights 
for the years ended december  and  overhead reimbursement fees reduced g a costs by approximately  and  respectively 
the company capitalized million and million of general and administrative costs in and  respectively 
other g a expenses on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe for the comparable period 
included in other income expense was interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  of  for the year ended december  compared to  in the same period 
interest expense  including facility fees  was million for on weighted average debt of million compared to interest expense of  on weighted average debt of approximately million for capitalized interest for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  in the prior year 
at december   our unproved property balance was million compared to million at december   resulting in the lower capitalized interest for also included in other income expense for the year ended december  was  representing amortization of deferred loan costs associated with our credit facility 
interest income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase in interest income is due primarily to the overall increase in funds that were invested in overnight money market funds  especially in december in the period between receipt of offering proceeds and closing the contango asset acquisition 
an income tax provision was recorded for the year ended december  of million 
for the year ended december   an income tax provision of million was recorded 
due to changes in amounts of permanent tax differences  including meals and entertainment and compensation expense  our effective tax rate changed from in to in as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards have been accumulated or acquired that will begin to expire in currently  we do not anticipate making federal tax payments in upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal of  net of income taxes of  and accretion expense  to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs and accumulated depletion and accretion 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share  as compared to net income of million  or basic and diluted earnings per share in basic weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million in the comparable period 
the impact of the shares issued in the miller transaction was not fully realized until since the merger closed and the shares were issued in december the same is true in for the shares issued in the public offering in december there were also increases due to options exercised and vesting of restricted stock during year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production total revenue increased from to for the years ended december  and  our product mix contributed the following percentages of production and revenues revenues production natural gas mcf natural gas liquids bbls crude oil bbl total mcfe includes effect of hedging and derivative transactions

natural gas revenue  excluding hedging activity  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for due to significantly higher average realized prices coupled with an increase in production  partially offset by a higher realized hedge loss 
excluding the effect of hedges  the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf compared to per mcf for this increase in average price received resulted in increased revenue of approximately million based on production 
for the year ended december   average natural gas production increased from mmcf d in to mmcf d in due to production from new wells drilled and acquired  primarily our o connor ranch east  gato creek and encinitas properties  partially offset by natural declines at our austin field and o connor ranch properties

the increase in oil and condensate production resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately  based on comparable period average prices 
revenue from the sale of ngls totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of from the total of million 
higher average realized prices for the year ended december  resulted in an increase in revenue of  based on production 
the average realized price for ngls for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel for the same period in production volumes for ngls increased  from bbls d for the year ended december  to bbls d for the year ended december  due primarily to new production from the thibodeaux well 
the increase in ngl production increased revenue by  based on comparable period average prices

the higher depletion rate per mcfe resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
for the year ended december   higher oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to a higher amortizable base in compared to the prior year without a corresponding increase in reserves 
depreciation of furniture and fixtures totaled  a decrease of compared to the prior year total of  as a result of certain assets related to the previous office building becoming fully depreciated

total general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  was million  an increase of compared to the prior year total of million 
total g a costs include deferred compensation related to repriced options  deferred compensation related to restricted stock grants and other g a costs 
deferred compensation expense consists of costs reported in accordance with fin and amortization related to restricted stock awards 
a fin charge of million was incurred for the year ended december  compared to a charge of  in the comparable prior year period as a result of the variable accounting for the interaction of the rising stock price and the exercise price of certain re priced options

an income tax provision was recorded for the year ended december  of million as compared to  for the year ended december  due to changes in permanent differences  including meals and entertainment and compensation expense  our effective tax rate changed from in to in as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards had been accumulated or acquired 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal of  net of income taxes of  and accretion expense  to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs and accumulated depletion and accretion 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share  as compared to net income of  or basic and diluted earnings per share in basic weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million in the comparable period 
the increase was due primarily to options exercised and vesting of restricted stock during the impact of the shares issued in december for the miller transaction was not fully realized until since the merger closing and share issuance occurred late in liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing source of capital is the cash flow generated from our operating activities supplemented by borrowings under our credit facility 
net cash generated from operating activities is a function of production volumes  commodity prices  which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  operating efficiency and capital spending 
our business  as with other extractive industries  is a depleting one in which each gas equivalent unit produced must be replaced or we  and a critical source of our future liquidity  will shrink 
our overall production decline is approximately per year as we look to the future 
less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows and  therefore capital budgets 
we attempt to mitigate the price risk with our hedging program 
reserves and production volumes are influenced  in part  by the amount of future capital expenditures 
in turn  capital expenditures are influenced by many factors including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  prices  availability of goods and services and the extent to which oil and gas properties are acquired 
for  a significant source of cash was the net proceeds of  that we received  before direct costs of million  from our december offering of  shares of our common stock 
in january  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option for  additional shares of our common stock resulting in an additional million of net proceeds to us 
as of march   we have approximately million available under this current shelf registration statement 
our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  and the repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt 
we attempt to fund our exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budget capital expenditures based on projected cash flows 
we routinely adjust capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices  drilling and acquisition costs  and cash flow 
we typically have funded acquisitions from borrowings under our credit facility and cash flow from operations 
we have historically utilized net cash provided by operating activities  debt and equity as capital resources to obtain necessary funding for all of our cash needs 
some significant changes to working capital may also affect our liquidity in the short term 
the increase in accrued fees for professional services and royalties payable at december  accounts for most of the increase in accrued liabilities 
therefore  we expect our short term cash outflows for the first quarter to increase as these liabilities come due 
the fair value of our outstanding hedge and derivative contracts is reflected on the balance sheet  and we show an asset and a liability for the separate positions with each of our two counterparties 
our asset position at december  is larger than it was at december  contributing to the working capital increase  slightly offset by the liability position that is included in the december  balance sheet 
the hedge and derivative financial instrument liability represents the amount by which future strip commodity prices exceed the price caps on our contracts at the balance sheet date 
the hedge and derivative financial instrument asset represents the amount by which strip commodity prices are lower than the price floors on our contracts at the balance sheet date 
should commodity prices increase or decrease  the applicable positions would change accordingly and the unrealized losses that are reflected in revenue and the unrealized gains reflected in other comprehensive income could possibly reduce or result in gains or losses  respectively 
when hedges and derivatives require cash settlement  the company is receiving higher cash inflows on the sale of production at higher prices  therefore the use of those funds would adequately cover any derivative and hedge payments when they come due 
we have historically used our credit facility to supplement any deficiencies between operating cash flow and capital expenditures 
we had million outstanding under the credit facility at december   which was subsequently reduced in january to million with proceeds from the underwriter s over allotment option to our december public stock offering see discussion below and further to million from cash on hand in february 
the maturity for this credit facility is december  after considering the impact of these working capital changes and our forecasts of future results of operations  we believe that cash flows from operating activities  as supplemented by borrowings on our credit facility  combined with our ability to control the timing of the majority of our future exploration and development requirements will provide us with the flexibility and liquidity to meet our planned capital requirements for in addition  our credit facility had million available at december  million after net proceeds from the underwriter over allotment option exercise in january were used to repay debt for general corporate purposes  exploratory and developmental drilling and acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
during  the rise in our stock price contributed to significant exercises of warrants and stock options  from which we have realized increased cash flows from financing activities 
on march   mr 
elias  our chairman and chief executive officer  exercised outstanding warrants for  shares of common stock  which resulted in proceeds to us of approximately  increased activity in stock option exercises has also resulted in proceeds to us of approximately million for the year ended december  we typically do not rely on proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options to sustain our business as they are unpredictable events 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of million consisting primarily of short term money market investments  as compared to million at december  working capital was million as of december   as compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the significant increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to higher total revenues partially offset by higher operating expense 
revenue for increased over the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in as compared to was due primarily to higher oil and gas revenue partially offset by higher operating expense 
net cash generated from operating activities is a function of commodity prices  which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  production and capital spending 
our business  as with other extractive industries  is a depleting one in which each gas equivalent produced must be replaced or we  and a critical source of our future liquidity  will shrink 
our ability to prevent shrinkage will be affected in the future by the successes and or failures of our exploration  production and acquisition activities 
less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows and  therefore capital budgets 
for these reasons  we only forecast  for internal use by management  an annual cash flow 
we do analyze contingent well opportunities that may extend further than one year  but do not rely on them for sustaining our business 
these annual forecasts are revised monthly and capital budgets are reviewed by management and adjusted as warranted by market conditions 
longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are neither developed nor used by management to operate our business 
in the event such capital resources are not available to us  our drilling and other activities may be curtailed 
see items and business and properties risk factors our operations have significant capital requirements 
net cash used in investing activities we reinvest a substantial portion of our cash flows in our drilling  acquisition  land and geophysical activities 
as a result  we used million in investing activities during capital expenditures for the year ended december  were partially offset by  of proceeds from the sale of one well and a gas cooler during the year 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs totaled million for the year ended december   which includes million related to the contango asset acquisition 
other spending includes million in expenditures attributable to land holdings and million for increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware  office furniture and equipment for the expansion into additional office space 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million for the year ended december   were partially offset by million of cash received in the miller merger net of merger costs incurred and million in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties during capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs  excluding miller  totaled million for the year ended december   and an additional million in expenditures was attributable to land holdings  including seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office equipment 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million for the year ended december   were partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties during capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs totaled million for the year ended december   and an additional million in expenditures was attributable to land holdings  including million for increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office equipment 
due to our active exploration  development and acquisition activities  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
approximately million is allocated to our expected drilling and production activities  million is allocated to land and seismic activities  and million relates to capitalized interest  g a and other 
we intend to fund these capital expenditures  and other commitments and working capital requirements with expected cash flow from operations and  to the extent necessary  other financing activities 
should there be a change in our pricing or production assumptions  we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility from other financing activities to meet our financial obligations as they come due  and we would recommend to our board an adjustment to our capital expenditures program accordingly so as to avoid unnecessary incremental borrowings that may be needed for acquisitions 
we do not explicitly budget for acquisitions  however  we do expect to spend considerable effort evaluating acquisition opportunities 
we expect to fund acquisitions through traditional reserve based bank debt and or the issuance of equity and  if required  through additional debt and equity financings 
net cash provided by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  we had million in borrowings and million in repayments under our credit facility 
we incurred loan costs of approximately million in establishing our new credit facility 
in addition  we received million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options and warrants exercised in  and we completed a public offering of common stock under our current shelf registration see discussion below in december that provided million of net proceeds  after direct costs 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million including million in borrowings and million in repayments under our credit facility 
in addition  we received million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in as a result of the increase in our stock price 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million  including million in borrowings and million in repayments under our credit facility 
in addition  we received million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in in connection with the december common stock offering  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option in january  which provided funds that were used to reduce our outstanding debt 
the combination of unused debt capacity and our current shelf registration will allow us the financial flexibility to participate in larger acquisitions and complete our capital programs as we move into as of december   we had million of unused borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
credit facility in march  the company entered into a new amended and restated credit facility the credit facility  effective december   which permits borrowings up to the lesser of i the borrowing base and ii million 
the credit facility matures december  and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to prime plus or libor plus 
as of december   million in borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility and our interest rate was 
effective december  the borrowing base under the credit facility was increased from million to million as a result of the contango asset acquisition and our drilling activities since the last redetermination 
based on the increase  our available borrowing capacity at december  was million 
we expect our borrowing base to be redetermined in april and semiannually thereafter 
the credit facility provides for certain restrictions  including but not limited to  limitations on additional borrowings  sales of oil and natural gas properties or other collateral  and engaging in merger or consolidation transactions 
the credit facility also prohibits dividends and certain distributions of cash or properties and certain liens 
the credit facility also contains the following financial covenants  among others the ebitdax to interest expense ratio requires that the ratio of a our consolidated ebitdax defined as ebitda plus similar non cash items and exploration and abandonment expenses for such period for the four fiscal quarters then ended to b our consolidated interest expense for the four fiscal quarters then ended  to not be less than to the working capital ratio requires that the amount of our consolidated current assets less our consolidated current liabilities  as defined in the agreement  be at least million 
for the purposes of calculating the working capital ratio  current assets is adjusted for unused capacity under credit agreement and hedging and derivative assets and current liabilities is adjusted for derivative and hedging liabilities and asset retirement obligations 
the maximum leverage ratio requires that the ratio  as of the last day of any fiscal quarter  of a total indebtedness as defined in the credit facility as of such fiscal quarter to b an amount equal to consolidated ebitdax for the two quarters then ended times two  not be greater than to consolidated ebitdax is a component of negotiated covenants with our lender and is presented here as part of the company s disclosure of its covenant obligations 
shelf registration statement we filed a million shelf registration statement with the sec  which became effective in may under the shelf registration statement  we may issue  from time to time  any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock or warrants for debt securities or equity securities in one or more offerings to those persons who agree to purchase our securities 
net proceeds  terms and pricing of the offering of securities issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of the offerings 
the shelf registration statement does not provide assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
our ability to utilize our shelf registration statement for the purpose of issuing  from time to time  any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock or warrants for debt securities or equity securities will depend upon  among other things  market conditions and the existence of investors who wish to purchase our securities at prices acceptable to us 
we completed an offering on december  of million shares of our common stock under our shelf registration statement  which generated net proceeds to us  before direct costs of the offering  of million 
these f unds were used to finance the contango asset acquisition preliminary adjusted purchase price of million and fund the costs of the offering and other general corporate purposes 
on january   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option for an additional  shares of common stock  which generated net proceeds to us of million 
these funds were used to reduce our outstanding debt 
each of these sales was made under our shelf registration statement such that at march   we had approximately million remaining for issuance under our shelf registration 
off balance sheet arrangements the company currently does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  by payment due date total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations excludes amounts for interest expense payable upon outstanding debt 
long term debt outstanding under our credit facility is subject to floating interest rates see note to our consolidated financial statements and payable on the last day of each calendar month while any loan amounts remain outstanding 
the company did not have any capital leases or purchase obligations as of december  the company has not included its aro liability here because historically the actual cash outlay is minimized significantly by the salvage value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we do not account for salvage value on our balance sheet  but we do not expect to realize the total value that we have accrued 
risk management activities derivatives hedging due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  we may enter into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from commodity price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements limit our ability to benefit from increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also reduces our potential exposure to adverse price movements 
our arrangements  to the extent we enter into any  apply to only a portion of our production  provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limits our potential gains from future increases in prices 
we also use price risk management transactions to protect forward pricing as a bidding strategy with respect to acquisition offers and execution 
none of these instruments are used for trading purposes 
on a quarterly basis  our management sets all of our price risk management policies  including volumes  types of instruments and counterparties 
these policies are implemented by management through the execution of trades by the chief financial officer after consultation and concurrence by the president and chairman of the board 
our board of directors monitors the company s price risk management policies and trades 
all of these price risk management transactions are considered derivative instruments and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these derivative instruments are intended to hedge our price risk and may be considered hedges for economic purposes  but certain of these transactions may not qualify for special cash flow hedge accounting 
therefore  depending on the type of transaction and the circumstances  different accounting treatment may apply to the timing and location of the income statement impact  but all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
the following table provides additional information regarding the company s various derivative and hedging transactions that were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as of december  fair value of contracts outstanding at december  contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period fair value of new contracts when entered into during asset liability changes in fair values attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions other changes in fair values fair values of contracts outstanding at december  the following table details the fair value of our commodity based derivative and hedging contracts by year of maturity and valuation methodology as of december  fair value of contracts at december  source of fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years total fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources asset liability prices based on models and other valuation methods total tax matters at december   we have cumulative net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  including million of nols acquired in the miller merger that expire beginning through the estimated nols presented herein assume that certain items  primarily intangible drilling costs  have been written off for tax purposes in the current year 
however  we have not made a final determination if an election will be made to capitalize all or part of these items for tax purposes in the future 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement requires companies to measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on a grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions  and that cost must generally be recognized over the vesting period 
sfas no 
r amends the original sfas no 
and that had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing pro forma disclosure only 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
we currently account for our stock based compensation plans under the principles prescribed by apb opinion no 
accordingly  no stock option compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will impact our results of operations  but will have no impact on our overall financial position 
sfas no 
r becomes effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we anticipate adopting the provisions of sfas no 
r in the third quarter of using the modified prospective method for transition 
under this method we will recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards granted or modified on or after july   as well as any previously granted awards that are not fully vested as of july  compensation expense will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we expect the impact to be an increase in deferred compensation expense of approximately  to  for sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reflected as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
we did not recognize any excess tax deductions during  or in connection with the exercise of stock options 
in september  the sec issued sab no 
 interaction of statement and the full cost rules  which we adopted in the fourth quarter of with no impact on our financial statements 
in accordance with sab no 
 the amortizable base used to calculate unit of production depletion includes estimated future development and dismantlement costs  and restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we use a credit facility  which has a floating interest rate  to finance a portion of our operations 
we are not subject to fair value risk resulting from changes in our floating interest rates 
the use of floating rate debt instruments provide a benefit due to downward interest rate movements but does not limit us to exposure from future increases in interest rates 
based on the year end december  outstanding borrowings and a floating interest rate of  a change in interest rate would result in an increase or decrease of interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
in the normal course of business we enter into hedging transactions  including commodity price collars  swaps and floors to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements  but not for trading or speculative purposes 
during and  due to the instability of prices and to achieve a more predictable cash flow  we put in place several natural gas and crude oil collars for a portion of our production 
during  we put in place several natural gas and crude oil collars covering production 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
while the use of these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
the following is a list of contracts outstanding at december  transaction date transaction type beginning ending price per unit volumes per day natural gas natural gas collar  mmbtu natural gas collar  mmbtu natural gas collar  mmbtu natural gas collar  mmbtu crude oil crude oil collar bbl the company s current hedging activities for natural gas were entered into on a per mmbtu delivered price basis  using the houston ship channel index  with settlement for each calendar month occurring five business days following the expiration date 
hedge accounting is not applied to the company s collars on crude oil  which were entered into on a per barrel delivered price basis  using the west texas intermediate index  with settlement for each calendar month occurring five business days following the expiration date 
the change in fair value is reflected in revenue for the year ended december  in august  the company replaced the hedge contract that was outstanding at june  with a new contract that changes the volume and pricing terms 
the put option is on bbl d and the call option is on bbl d 
this transaction was completed at no additional cost to the company 
at december   the fair value of the outstanding hedge and derivative contracts was a net asset of approximately million see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management activities hedging derivatives 
a change in the commodity price per unit  as long as the price is either above the ceiling or below the floor price of each contract  would cause the fair value total of the outstanding net asset position to increase or decrease by approximately
