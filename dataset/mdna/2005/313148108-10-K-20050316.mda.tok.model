various factors could cause farmer mac s actual results or events to differ materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the forward looking statements  including uncertainties regarding o the rate and direction of development of the secondary market for agricultural mortgage loans  o the possible establishment of additional statutory or regulatory restrictions or constraints on farmer mac that could hamper its growth or diminish its profitability  o increases in general and administrative expenses attributable to growth of the business and the regulatory environment  including the hiring of additional personnel with expertise in key functional areas  o legislative or regulatory developments or interpretations of farmer mac s statutory charter that could adversely affect farmer mac  the ability of farmer mac to offer new products or the ability or motivation of certain lenders to participate in its programs or the terms of any such participation  or increase the cost of regulation and related corporate activities  o possible reaction in the financial markets to events involving gses other than farmer mac  o farmer mac s access to the debt markets at favorable rates and terms  o the possible effect of the risk based capital requirement  which could  under certain circumstances  be in excess of the statutory minimum capital requirement  o the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness  o lender interest in farmer mac credit products and the farmer mac secondary market  o borrower preferences for fixed rate agricultural mortgage indebtedness  o competitive pressures in the purchase of agricultural mortgage loans and the sale of agricultural mortgage backed securities and debt securities  o substantial changes in interest rates  agricultural land values  commodity prices  export demand for us agricultural products  the general economy and other factors that may affect delinquency levels and credit losses  o protracted adverse weather  market or other conditions affecting particular geographic regions or particular agricultural commodities or products related to agricultural mortgage loans backing farmer mac i guaranteed securities or under ltspcs  o the willingness of investors to invest in agricultural mortgage backed securities  or o the effects on the agricultural economy or the value of agricultural real estate of any changes in federal assistance for agriculture 
the foregoing factors are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect farmer mac s business and its financial performance 
furthermore  new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor assess the effects of such factors on farmer mac s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
in light of these potential risks and uncertainties  no undue reliance should be placed on any forward looking statements expressed in this report

critical accounting policy and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policy that is both important to the portrayal of farmer mac s financial condition and results of operations and requires complex  subjective judgments is the accounting policy for the allowance for losses 
farmer mac s allowance for losses is presented in four components on its consolidated balance sheet o an allowance for loan losses on loans held for investment  o a valuation allowance on real estate owned  which is included in the balance sheet under real estate owned  net of valuation allowance  o a contingent obligation for probable losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs entered into or modified after january   for which inherent losses existed at the time of the guarantee or commitment and could be reasonably estimated  is included in the balance sheet as a portion of the amount reported as guarantee and commitment obligation  and o an allowance for losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  which is included in the balance sheet under reserve for losses 
the provision for losses is presented in two components on the consolidated statement of operations o a provision for loan losses  which represents losses on farmer mac s loans held for investment  and o a provision for losses  which represents losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs and real estate owned 
the purpose of the allowance for losses is to provide for estimated losses that are probable to have occurred as of the balance sheet date  and not to predict or account for future potential losses 
the determination of the allowance for losses requires management to make significant estimates based on information available as of the balance sheet date  including the amounts and timing of losses and current market and economic conditions 
these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods if such conditions and information change 
for example  a decline in the national or agricultural economy could result in an increase in delinquencies or foreclosures  which may require additional allowances for losses in future periods 
farmer mac maintains an allowance for losses to cover estimated probable losses on loans held for investment  real estate owned and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins with management s evaluation of the results of its proprietary loan pool simulation and guarantee fee model the model 
the model draws upon historical information from a data set of agricultural mortgage loans recorded over a longer period of time than farmer mac s own experience to date  screened to include only those loans with credit characteristics similar to those on which farmer mac has assumed credit risk 
the results generated by the model are modified by the application of management s judgment as required to take key factors into account  including o economic conditions  o geographic and agricultural commodity product concentrations in farmer mac s portfolio  o the credit profile of farmer mac s portfolio  o delinquency trends of farmer mac s portfolio  o farmer mac s experience in the management and sale of real estate owned  and o historical charge off and recovery activities of farmer mac s portfolio 
the allowance for losses is increased through periodic provisions for loan losses that are charged against net interest income and provisions for losses charged to operating expenses and reduced by charge offs for actual losses  net of recoveries 
negative provisions for loan losses or provisions for losses are recorded in the event that the estimate of probable losses as of the end of a period is lower than the estimate at the beginning of the period 
charge offs represent losses on the outstanding principal balance  any interest payments previously accrued or advanced and expected costs of liquidation 
the establishment of and periodic adjustments to the valuation allowance for real estate owned are charged against income as a portion of the provision for losses charged to operating expense 
gains and losses on the sale of real estate owned are recorded in income based on the difference between the recorded investment at the time of sale and liquidation proceeds 
no allowance for losses has been made for loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act or farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests  which are expected to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans 
usda guaranteed portions collateralizing farmer mac ii guaranteed securities are obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
as of december   farmer mac had experienced no credit losses on any pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or on any farmer mac ii guaranteed securities and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future

results of operations overview 
net income available to common stockholders for rose to million or per diluted common share  compared to million or per diluted common share in and million or per diluted common share in farmer mac s business volume declined in  with outstanding guarantee and ltspc volume as of december  that was million lower than as of december  during  farmer mac o added million of farmer mac i eligible loans under ltspcs  o purchased million of newly originated farmer mac i eligible loans  and o purchased million of farmer mac ii usda guaranteed portions of loans 
as of december   the percentage of day delinquencies farmer mac i loans purchased or placed under farmer mac i guaranteed securities or ltspcs after changes to farmer mac s statutory charter in that were days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  or in bankruptcy  excluding loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan decreased to percent of the principal balance of all loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to percent at the end of and percent at the end of after careful evaluation of the overall improved credit quality of farmer mac s portfolio  the strong us agricultural economy  the recent upward trend in agricultural land values and the million year over year reduction in farmer mac s outstanding guarantees and commitments  farmer mac determined that the appropriate level of allowance for losses as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  as a result of this determination  farmer mac released a net million from its allowance for losses in  compared to total provisions for losses of million in and million in for further discussion of the change in the allowance for losses and provision for losses  see risk management credit risk loans 
as of december   farmer mac had million of real estate owned  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  prior to acquisition of property securing a loan  farmer mac develops a liquidation strategy that results in either an immediate sale or retention pending later sale 
farmer mac evaluates these and other alternatives based upon the economics of the transactions and the requirements of local law 
the decrease in real estate owned in was the result of the lower default rate in farmer mac s portfolio and the completion of the liquidation process of previously held real estate owned 
farmer mac s portfolio also has developed a core of loans that  though the borrowers on those loans have filed for bankruptcy protection  are current under the original terms of the loans or as modified under a court approved bankruptcy plan 
the following table presents farmer mac s non performing assets  which aggregates day delinquencies  loans performing in bankruptcy and real estate owned 
as of december  in thousands day delinquencies including loans in   foreclosure and loans restructured after delinquency loans performing in bankruptcy   real estate owned   non performing assets   the following table presents historical information regarding farmer mac s non performing assets and day delinquencies outstanding post act less loans  non reo and guarantees and performing performing day ltspcs assets percentage bankruptcies delinquencies percentage dollars in thousands as of december      september      june      march      december      september      june      march      december      september      june      march      farmer mac experienced million in net losses charged against the allowance for losses in  compared with million in net losses for and million in farmer mac recorded gains on the sale of real estate owned of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  farmer mac recovered approximately million from three sellers one of which was a related party for breaches of representations and warranties associated with prior sales of agricultural mortgage loans to farmer mac  which amount farmer mac had previously charged off as losses on the associated loans  consistent with its policy on accounting for claims for breaches of representations and warranties 
as these payments are received from sellers rather than borrowers  these recoveries are reported as other income and are not reflected as recoveries in the net losses charged against the allowance for losses discussed above 
as of december   approximately billion percent of farmer mac s portfolio of post act farmer mac i loans and loans underlying ltspcs and farmer mac guaranteed securities were in their peak default years approximately years three through five after origination  compared to billion percent as of december  and billion percent as of december  notwithstanding the recent positive trends in delinquency rates and the overall agricultural economy  during  the level of day delinquencies could increase and higher charge offs could follow 
outlook for usda s most recent publications as available on usda s website as of march  forecast o net cash farm income to be billion  exceeding the two successive record years of billion in and billion in o net farm income to be billion  which is a decrease of billion from the record billion estimated for but still million higher than the year average net farm income  o total direct government payments to be billion in  an increase from the estimate of billion 
market prices for crops affect direct government payment rates for government programs  usda anticipates program crop prices to be lower in  due to large inventories from and bumper crops  o the value of us farm real estate to increase percent in to trillion  a smaller increase as compared to the increase of percent 
usda is anticipating improvement in the general economy to support further growth in farmland values  though at a rate slower than the average annual gain of percent since  and o the amount of farm real estate debt to increase by percent in to billion  up from billion in the usda forecast components referenced above relate to us agriculture generally  but should be favorable for farmer mac s financial condition relative to its exposure to outstanding guarantees and commitments  as they indicate strong borrower cash flows  and generally increased values in us farm real estate 
factors that significantly lowered farmer mac s new business volume compared to previous years included o reduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market  due largely to the increased liquidity of agricultural borrowers  o increased available capital and liquidity of agricultural lenders  o new alternative sources of funding and credit enhancement for agricultural lenders  o increased competition in the secondary market for purchases of quality agricultural mortgage loans  o adverse publicity about and increased regulatory pressure on gses  and o uncertainty created by the proposed fca regulation concerning risk weighting of assets held by fcs institutions which  if adopted in its current form  could decrease the value of ltspcs and farmer mac swaps to those institutions see regulatory matters 
these factors are likely to continue to constrain farmer mac s business opportunities and growth through at least as a matter of historical practice  many financial institutions have preferred to retain agricultural mortgage loans in their portfolios rather than sell the loans into the secondary market 
that preference persists notwithstanding the corporate finance and capital planning benefits these institutions might otherwise realize through participation in farmer mac s programs  such as greater liquidity  greater lending capacity  increased return on equity  and decreased capital requirements 
in recent years  the preference to retain loans has been reinforced by the stronger capital and liquidity positions of agricultural lenders  combined with their willingness to accept greater asset and liability mismatch in light of the significant differential between lower  short term interest rates and higher  long term rates 
those stronger capital and liquidity positions  in turn  have increased competition in the origination  funding and acquisition for investment of the limited supply of new agricultural real estate mortgage lending opportunities 
limited supply and increased demand by fcs institutions  insurance companies  commercial banks and other financial institutions for agricultural mortgage loans have narrowed the investment returns on those loans  as has the ability of some lending institutions to subsidize  in effect  their agricultural mortgage loan rates through low return use of equity 
these conditions have limited the need for many agricultural lenders to obtain the benefits of farmer mac s programs 
farmer mac expects these conditions to continue through at least see business volume 
farmer mac faces significant challenges in its efforts to regain its past business volume levels 
unless the corporation is successful in its current efforts to expand beyond its current business with the fcs and with the commercial banks  its business prospects will continue to be constrained 
to succeed in realizing its business development and profitability goals over the longer term  farmer mac must successfully market existing and new programs and products to agricultural mortgage lenders 
farmer mac s outstanding program volume as of december  was billion  which represented percent of management s estimate of a billion market of eligible agricultural mortgage loans 
as part of its efforts to capture a greater share of the market  farmer mac is proceeding with a new strategic alliance with a related party fcs institution and sees additional longer term opportunities that could lead to renewed growth in business volume as a result of the corporation s marketing efforts 
further  farmer mac believes that prospects for larger portfolio transactions similar to those that have accounted for a significant portion of growth in prior years continue to exist  but  in light of market conditions  no assurance can be given at this time as to the certainty or timing of such transactions 
while farmer mac will continue to market actively its existing secondary market products  it also must address the constraints of the existing business environment  consistent with its charter and purposes 
therefore  farmer mac is actively evaluating new loan programs intended to provide for new  diversified business opportunities 
in that regard  the board and management are carrying out initiatives that include agribusiness  federal and state agricultural finance programs  new arrangements to encourage agricultural mortgage sales by banks  and rural development associated with agriculture 
some of the agribusiness and rural development initiatives will require farmer mac to consider credit risks that expand upon or differ from those the corporation has accepted previously 
farmer mac will use underwriting standards appropriate to those credit risks  and likely will draw upon outside expertise to analyze and evaluate the credit and funding aspects of loans submitted pursuant to those initiatives 
while farmer mac is seeking actively to expand its mix of loan types within the scope of its congressional charter  investors are cautioned that it is too early to assess the probability of success of these efforts 
during and to date  farmer mac has continued to validate and enhance its risk management practices  internal controls  accounting and financial reporting  as a result of ongoing corporate diligence and a number of regulatory considerations  including the sarbanes oxley act of and fca requirements  as well as the general regulatory environment for gses 
a detailed presentation of farmer mac s financial results for the years ended december   and follows 
net interest income 
net interest income  which does not include guarantee fees for loans purchased prior to april  the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  was million for  million for and million for the net interest yield was basis points for the year ended december   compared to basis points for the year ended december  and basis points for the year ended december  the effect of the adoption of sfas was a reclassification of approximately million basis points of guarantee fee income as interest income for the year ended december   compared to million basis points for the year ended december  and million basis points for the year ended december  in  the chief accountant at the us securities and exchange commission provided additional guidance to all registrants regarding the classification on the statement of operations of realized gains and losses resulting from financial derivatives that are not in fair value or cash flow hedge relationships 
all registrants were requested to comply with this guidance in future filings and to reclassify this activity for all prior periods presented 
as a result of the application of this additional guidance  the net interest income and expense realized on financial derivatives that are not in fair value or cash flow hedge relationships have been reclassified from net interest income into gains and losses on financial derivatives and trading assets 
for the years ended december   and  this reclassification resulted in a decrease of the net interest yield of basis points  one basis point  and basis points  respectively 
the net interest yields for the years ended december   and included the benefits of yield maintenance payments received of basis points  basis points and basis points  respectively 
yield maintenance payments represent the present value of expected future interest income streams and accelerate the recognition of interest income from the related loans 
because the timing and size of these payments vary greatly  variations should not be considered indicative of positive or negative trends to gauge future financial results 
for the years ended december   and  the after tax effects of yield maintenance payments on net income and diluted earnings per share were million or per diluted share  million or per diluted share and million or per diluted share  respectively 
in light of current expectations that interest rates will rise during  it should be expected that prepayments will be down in the year  which would result in lower levels of yield maintenance payments received by farmer mac 
the following table provides information regarding interest earning assets and funding for the years ended december   and the balance of non accruing loans is included in the average balance of interest earning loans presented  though no related income is included in the income figures presented 
therefore  as the balance of non accruing loans increases or decreases  the net interest yield will increase or decrease accordingly 
net interest income and the yield will also fluctuate due to the uncertainty of the timing and size of yield maintenance payments 
the low average rate earned on cash and cash equivalents reflects the relatively low level of short term interest rates in and  compared to  and an increase in short term market rates in compared to the decrease in the average rate for investments reflects the narrower spreads between us treasury securities and corresponding floating rate investments acquired and outstanding during  compared to wider spreads on investments acquired and outstanding during the prior periods 
the lower average rate on loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities reflects the normal amortization and prepayment of principal balances of older  higher yielding fixed rate loans 
the fluctuations in the average rate on farmer mac s notes payable due within one year are consistent with general trends in average short term rates during the periods presented 
the downward trend in the average rate on notes payable due after one year reflects the retirement of older  higher rate debt  as well as the issuance of new debt at lower rates and the relative stability of long term interest rates during average income average average income average average income average balance expense rate balance expense rate balance expense rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash and cash equivalents       investments       loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities       total interest earning assets       funding notes payable due within one year       notes payable due after one year       total interest bearing liabilities       net non interest bearing funding    total funding       net interest income yield    the following table sets forth information regarding the changes in the components of farmer mac s net interest income for the periods indicated 
for each category  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume change in volume multiplied by old rate and changes in rate change in rate multiplied by old volume 
combined rate volume variances  the third element of the calculation  are allocated based on their relative size 
the increases due to rate reflect the short term or adjustable rate nature of the assets or liabilities and the general increases in short term market rates  while the decrease due to rate for loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities reflects the normal amortization and prepayment of principal balances of older higher yielding fixed rate loans  as described above

guarantee and commitment fee income  which compensate farmer mac for assuming the credit risk on loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs  was million for  compared to million for and million for the increase in guarantee and commitment fee income reflects an increase in the average balance of outstanding guarantees and ltspcs 
for  the effect of sfas classified million of guarantee fees received as interest income  although management considers that amount to have been earned in consideration for the assumption of credit risk 
that portion of the difference or spread between the cost of farmer mac s debt funding for loans and the yield on post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities held on its books compensates for credit and interest rate risk 
when a post act farmer mac i guaranteed security is sold to a third party  farmer mac continues to receive the guarantee fee component of that spread  which continues to compensate farmer mac for its assumption of credit risk 
the portion of the spread that compensates for interest rate risk would not typically continue to be received by farmer mac if the asset were sold  except to the extent attributable to any retained interest only strip 
gains and losses on financial derivatives and trading assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas requires the change in the fair values of financial derivatives to be reflected in a company s net income or accumulated other comprehensive income 
the net effect of financial derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas and trading assets recorded in farmer mac s consolidated statements of operations was a net gain of million for  a net gain of million for and a net loss of million for on a net after tax basis  those gains and losses  combined with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles and benefits received from the elimination of the amortization of certain premium payments that resulted from sfas  increased net income available to common stockholders by million in  increased net income available to common stockholders by million for and reduced net income available to common stockholders by million for gains on the sale of real estate owned 
gains on the sale of real estate owned were million  million and million for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
representation and warranty claims income 
during  farmer mac recovered approximately million from three sellers one of which was a related party for breaches of representations and warranties associated with prior sales of agricultural mortgage loans to farmer mac 
during and  farmer mac had no representation and warranty claims income 
other income 
other income was million for  compared to million for and million for expenses 
during and  and into  farmer mac undertook and expects to continue several initiatives to validate and enhance its risk management practices  internal controls  and accounting and financial reporting 
these initiatives are the result of ongoing corporate diligence and a number of regulatory considerations  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and fca requirements  as well as the heightened focus on the regulatory environment for gses generally 
the general increases in both compensation and employee benefits and general and administrative expenses from to reflect the costs of those initiatives  particularly staffing increases relative to the internal controls function 
compensation and employee benefits were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses  including consultants fees  were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
farmer mac expects all of the above mentioned expenses to continue at or above current levels through regulatory fees were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
fca has advised farmer mac that its estimated assessment for is million 
the regulatory assessments from fca for each of the examination periods corresponding approximately with each of the years ended december   and include both their originally estimated assessments and revisions to those estimates that reflect actual costs incurred 
these revisions have resulted in both additional assessments and refunds in the past 
real estate owned net operating expenses were million for each of the years ended december  and these net costs were negligible for the year ended december  after careful evaluation of the overall improved credit quality of farmer mac s portfolio  the strong us agricultural economy  the recent upward trend in agricultural land values and the million year over year reduction in farmer mac s outstanding guarantees and commitments  farmer mac determined that the appropriate level of allowance for losses as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  as a result of this determination  farmer mac released a net million from its allowance for losses in  compared to total provisions for the allowance for losses in and of million and million  respectively 
for  the release of the allowance for losses of million was the net effect of a release of million from the provision for losses  which is a component of operating expenses  and a partially offsetting provision for loan losses of million  which was charged against net interest income 
the million release from the provision for losses in compares to provisions for losses of million and million for and  respectively 
for additional information regarding farmer mac s provisions for losses and allowances for losses in the aggregate  see risk management credit risk loans 
income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million in  compared to million in and million in farmer mac s effective tax rates for  and were approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively 
for more information about income taxes  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
gains and losses on the repurchase of debt 
during and  farmer mac did not repurchase any of its outstanding debt 
during  farmer mac recognized million of net gains on the repurchase of million of its outstanding debt 
all of the repurchases were from outstanding farmer mac debt that had a maturity date of october  and an interest rate of percent 
those debt securities were replaced with new fixed rate funding to the same maturity dates at more attractive interest rates  which preserved farmer mac s asset liability match and reduced future interest expense 
non gaap performance measures 
farmer mac reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in addition to gaap measures  farmer mac presents certain non gaap performance measures 
farmer mac uses the latter measures to develop financial plans  to gauge corporate performance and to set incentive compensation because  in management s view  the non gaap measures more accurately represent farmer mac s economic performance  transaction economics and business trends 
investors and the investment analyst community have previously relied upon similar measures to evaluate farmer mac s historical and future performance 
farmer mac s disclosure of non gaap measures is not intended to replace gaap information but  rather  to supplement it 
farmer mac developed non gaap core earnings to present net income less the after tax effects of sfas and less the after tax net gains and losses on the repurchase of debt that  prior to january   were reported as extraordinary items 
core earnings for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the reconciliation of gaap net income available to common stockholders to core earnings is presented in the following table reconciliation of gaap net income available to common stockholders to core earnings for the year ended december  in thousands gaap net income available to common stockholders    less the effects of sfas unrealized gains losses on financial derivatives and trading assets  net of tax   benefit from non amortization of premium payments on financial derivatives  net of tax less gains on the repurchase of debt previously reported as extraordinary items core earnings    effects of sfas on accounting for callable interest rate swaps 
farmer mac enters into financial derivative transactions to protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements on the value of assets  future cash flows and debt issuance  not for trading or speculative purposes 
farmer mac enters into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the characteristics of its short term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer term mortgage and other assets  and also to adjust the characteristics of its long term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its short term assets  thereby reducing interest rate risk and also to derive an overall lower effective fixed rate cost of borrowing than would otherwise be available to farmer mac in the conventional debt market 
specifically  interest rate swaps convert economically the variable cash flows related to the forecasted issuance of short term debt to effectively fixed rate medium term and long term notes that match the anticipated duration  repricing and interest rate characteristics of the corresponding assets 
since this strategy provides farmer mac with the same cash flows as those that are inherent in the issuance of medium term notes  farmer mac uses either the bond market or the swap market based upon their relative pricing efficiencies 
farmer mac uses callable interest rate swaps in conjunction with the issuance of short term debt as an alternative to callable medium term notes with equivalently structured maturities and call options 
the call options on the swaps are designed to match the implicit prepayment options on those mortgage assets without prepayment protection 
the blended durations of the swaps are also designed to match the duration of the mortgages over their estimated lives 
if the mortgages prepay  the swaps can be called and the short term debt repaid  if the mortgages do not prepay  the swaps remain outstanding and the short term debt is rolled over  effectively providing fixed rate callable funding over the lives of the mortgages 
thus  the economics of the assets are closely matched to the economics of the interest rate swap and funding combination 
the callable interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on farmer mac s balance sheet with the related changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
although farmer mac believes that this strategy achieves its economic and risk management objectives  the financial accounting standards board has adopted a mixed attribute accounting model for callable swaps that does not reflect the economics of the transactions 
pursuant to that model  while the issuance of a callable medium term note is recorded at historical cost  the economic equivalent the issuance of short term debt with the forecasted rollover of that debt and the simultaneous issuance of a callable interest rate swap is recorded differently the discount notes are recorded at historical cost and the interest rate swap is recorded at fair value 
despite the closely matched economics and optionality of the assets and the associated interest rate swap and funding combination  the callable swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas because the test for hedge effectiveness under sfas is based on the linkage between the forecasted short term funding and the callable interest rate swap and ignores the prepayable characteristics of the associated assets being funded 
business volume 
loans are brought into the farmer mac i and farmer mac ii programs as follows o farmer mac purchases eligible loans and guarantees timely payments of principal and interest of securities backed by those loans as part of the farmer mac i program 
farmer mac may retain some or all of those securities in its portfolio or sell them to third parties in capital markets transactions 
o farmer mac purchases usda guaranteed portions of loans and guarantees timely payments of principal and interest of securities backed by those guaranteed portions as part of the farmer mac ii program 
farmer mac may retain some or all of those securities in its portfolio or sell them to third parties in capital markets transactions 
o farmer mac enters into ltspcs for eligible loans 
farmer mac s commitments through ltspcs include either newly originated or seasoned eligible loans  and are part of the farmer mac i program 
o farmer mac exchanges farmer mac guaranteed securities for eligible loans or usda guaranteed portions of loans 
farmer mac guaranteed securities exchanged for usda guaranteed portions of loans are part of the farmer mac ii program  farmer mac guaranteed securities exchanged for any other eligible loans are part of the farmer mac i program 
during  the volume of loans purchased or placed under farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs totaled billion  a decrease from volume of billion 
that decrease was attributable to a decrease of million in farmer mac i loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities volume  a decrease of million in ltspc volume  and a decrease of million in farmer mac ii volume in see business farmer mac programs farmer mac i off balance sheet guarantees and commitments and note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of ltspcs

the purchase price for loans purchased from all related parties is determined in the same manner as for loans acquired from any other third party 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of related party transactions 
as part of fulfilling its guarantee obligations for farmer mac i guaranteed securities and commitments to purchase eligible loans underlying ltspcs  farmer mac purchases defaulted loans  all of which are at least days delinquent at the time of purchase  out of those securities and pools 
the purchase price for defaulted loans purchased out of farmer mac i guaranteed securities is the current outstanding principal balance of the loan plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the purchase price for defaulted loans purchased under an ltspc is the then current outstanding principal balance of the loan  with accrued and unpaid interest on the defaulted loans payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation proceeds as received 
the purchase price of a defaulted loan is not an indicator of the expected loss on that loan  many other factors affect expected loss  if any  on loans so purchased

farmer mac may  in its sole discretion  repurchase the defaulted loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and is obligated to purchase those underlying an ltspc 
with respect to the transfer of loans from on balance sheet farmer mac i guaranteed securities to loans  when particular criteria are met  such as the default of the borrower  farmer mac becomes entitled to purchase the defaulted loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities commonly referred to as removal of account provisions 
farmer mac records all such defaulted loans at their value during the period in which farmer mac becomes entitled to repurchase the loans and therefore regains effective control over the transferred loans 
fair value is determined by appraisal or management s estimate of discounted collateral value 
farmer mac records  at acquisition  the difference between each loan s acquisition cost and its fair value  if any  as a charge to the reserve for losses 
the weighted average age of the farmer mac i newly originated and current seasoned loans purchased during both and was less than one year

the weighted average age of delinquent loans purchased out of securitized pools and ltspcs during and was years and years  respectively 
the outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying ltspcs and on and off balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities decreased six percent to billion as of december  from billion as of december  the following table sets forth information regarding those outstanding balances as of the dates indicated outstanding balance of farmer mac loans and loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs as of december  in thousands farmer mac i post act loans and guaranteed securities    ltspcs    pre act    farmer mac ii    total    the following table sets forth information regarding the farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued during the periods indicated farmer mac i guaranteed securities issuances for the year ended december  in thousands retained sold    swap transactions  total farmer mac guaranteed securities issuances    based on market conditions  farmer mac either retains the loans it purchases or securitizes them and issues farmer mac i guaranteed securities backed by those loans

this transaction resulted from the participant s exercise of a conversion feature incorporated in all existing ltspcs 
farmer mac s decision to retain the remainder of the loans it purchased was based on favorable underlying funding costs that resulted in attractive net interest income over the lives of the loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities it holds 
ltspcs typically involve seasoned loans  while cash purchase transactions usually represent acquisitions of newly originated loans 
the decreased ltspc activity in was a result of reduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market  which have tended to be a function of the interest rate environment and other factors described two paragraphs below 
with particular regard to fcs institutions  some business prospects have been constrained by increased fcsic insurance premiums assessed on loans held by those institutions  including loans under ltspcs 
in addition  fcsic has recently indicated to those institutions that they should be cautious about the risk of doing business with gses  including farmer mac  as counterparties 
moreover  fcsic has raised objections to fcs institutions use of farmer mac swaps  which generate farmer mac i guaranteed securities that are not subject to the previously mentioned insurance premiums 
notwithstanding this  management expects that ltspcs will continue to constitute a significant portion of new farmer mac i program activity during indicators of future loan purchase and guarantee volume excluding ltspc  swap or portfolio purchase volume in the immediately succeeding reporting period include outstanding commitments to purchase loans other than under ltspcs and the total balance of loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet purchased 
many purchase commitments entered into by farmer mac are mandatory delivery commitments 
if a seller obtains a mandatory commitment and is unable to deliver the loans required  farmer mac requires the seller to pay a fee to modify  extend or cancel the commitment 
as of december   outstanding commitments to purchase farmer mac i loans and farmer mac ii guaranteed portions totaled million  compared to million as of december  all of those commitments were mandatory commitments 
loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet committed to purchase totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  not all of such loans are purchased  as some are denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller 
new business volume decreased during compared to factors that significantly lowered farmer mac s new business volume compared to previous years included o reduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market  due largely to the increased liquidity of agricultural borrowers  o increased available capital and liquidity of agricultural lenders  o new alternative sources of funding and credit enhancement for agricultural lenders  o increased competition in the secondary market for purchases of quality agricultural mortgage loans  o adverse publicity about and increased regulatory pressure on gses  and o uncertainty created by the proposed fca regulation concerning risk weighting of assets held by fcs institutions which  if adopted in its current form  could decrease the value of ltspcs and farmer mac swaps to those institutions see regulatory matters 
during  farmer mac was not able to replicate recent prior years volume growth in farmer mac i and ii individual loan purchases  nor in additions to existing ltspc arrangements 
however  farmer mac believes its marketing initiatives are generating business opportunities for and beyond 
initiatives currently underway include o new and expanded business relationships  including a strategic alliance with a related party farm credit system institution that will serve a cross section of agricultural lenders in many areas of the nation  o product enhancements  such as new open prepayment loan structures  o agribusiness and rural development loans associated with agriculture  in fulfillment of its congressional mission  o federal and state agricultural finance programs  and o new loan securitization structures 
some of the agribusiness and rural development initiatives will require farmer mac to consider credit risks that expand upon or differ from those the corporation has accepted previously 
farmer mac will use underwriting standards appropriate to those credit risks  and likely will draw upon outside expertise to analyze and evaluate the credit and funding aspects of loans submitted pursuant to those initiatives 
while farmer mac is seeking actively to expand its mix of loan types within the scope of its congressional charter  investors are cautioned that it is too early to assess the probability of success of these efforts 
farmer mac believes that prospects for larger portfolio transactions similar to those that have accounted for a significant portion of growth in prior years continue to exist  but  in light of market conditions  no assurance can be given at this time as to the certainty or timing of such transactions

off balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac offers approved agricultural and rural residential mortgage lenders two alternatives to increase their liquidity or lending capacity while retaining the cash flow benefits of their loans farmer mac guaranteed securities  which are available through either the farmer mac i program or the farmer mac ii program  and ltspcs  which are available only through the farmer mac i program 
both of these alternatives result in off balance sheet transactions for farmer mac 
to be eligible for the farmer mac i program  a loan must meet farmer mac s credit underwriting  appraisal and documentation standards 
accordingly  farmer mac believes the credit risk it assumes for farmer mac guaranteed securities backed by loans that are eligible for the farmer mac i program and for ltspcs is the same and considers the effects of all on and off balance sheet activities on its overall portfolio diversification and credit risk

risk management interest rate risk 
farmer mac is subject to interest rate risk on all assets held for investment because of possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities 
this risk is primarily related to loans held and on balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities because of the ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled maturities  thereby increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow mismatches 
cash flow mismatches in a changing interest rate environment can reduce the earnings of the corporation if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash flows must be reinvested in lower yielding investments when farmer mac s funding costs cannot be correspondingly reduced  or if assets repay more slowly than expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher cost debt 
yield maintenance provisions and other prepayment penalties contained in many agricultural mortgage loans reduce  but do not eliminate  prepayment risk  particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield maintenance may not be collected 
those provisions require borrowers to make an additional payment when they prepay their loans so that  when reinvested with the prepaid principal  yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid 
those provisions create a disincentive to prepayment and compensate the corporation for its interest rate risks to a large degree 
as of december   percent of the outstanding balance of all loans held and loans underlying on balance sheet farmer mac i guaranteed securities including percent of all loans with fixed interest rates were covered by yield maintenance provisions and other prepayment penalties 
as of december   percent of the total outstanding balance of retained farmer mac i loans and guaranteed securities had yield maintenance provisions and percent had other forms of prepayment protection 
of the farmer mac i new and current loans purchased in  percent had yield maintenance or another form of prepayment protection including percent of all loans with fixed interest rates 
as of december   none of the usda guaranteed portions underlying farmer mac ii guaranteed securities had yield maintenance provisions  however  percent contained prepayment penalties 
of the usda guaranteed portions purchased in  percent contained prepayment penalties 
taking into consideration the prepayment provisions and the default probabilities associated with its mortgage assets  farmer mac uses prepayment models to project and value cash flows associated with these assets 
because borrowers behavior in various interest rate environments may change over time  farmer mac periodically evaluates the effectiveness of these models compared to actual prepayment experience and adjusts and refines the models as necessary to improve the precision of subsequent prepayment forecasts 
in addition  farmer mac consults with independent prepayment experts as part of the model evaluation process 
the goal of interest rate risk management at farmer mac is to create and maintain a portfolio that generates stable earnings and value across a variety of interest rate environments 
farmer mac s primary strategy for managing interest rate risk is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar durations so that they will perform similarly as interest rates change 
to achieve this match  farmer mac issues discount notes and both callable and non callable medium term notes across a spectrum of maturities 
farmer mac issues callable debt to offset the prepayment risk associated with some mortgage assets 
by using a blend of liabilities that includes callable debt  the interest rate sensitivities of the liabilities tend to increase or decrease as interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the interest rate sensitivities of the assets 
farmer mac also uses financial derivatives to alter the duration of its assets and liabilities to better match their durations  thereby reducing overall interest rate sensitivity 
farmer mac s million of cash and cash equivalents as of december  matures within three months and is match funded with discount notes having similar maturities 
as of december   million of the billion of investment securities percent were floating rate securities with rates that adjust within one year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on investment securities 
these floating rate investments are funded using o a series of discount note issuances in which each successive discount note is issued and matures on or about the corresponding repricing date of the related investment  o floating rate notes having similar rate reset provisions as the related investment  or o fixed rate notes swapped to floating rates having similar reset provisions as the related investment 
farmer mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans  including loans that farmer mac has committed to acquire other than through ltspcs but has not yet purchased 
when farmer mac commits to purchase such loans  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the time it commits to purchase the loans and the time it either o sells farmer mac guaranteed securities backed by the loans  or o issues debt to retain the loans in its portfolio although issuing debt to fund the loans as investments does not fully eliminate interest rate risk due to the possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities  as discussed above 
farmer mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans  and any related farmer mac guaranteed securities or debt issuance  through the use of forward sale contracts on the debt and mortgage backed securities of other gses and futures contracts involving us treasury securities 
farmer mac uses forward sale contracts on gse securities to reduce its interest rate exposure to changes in both treasury rates and spreads on farmer mac debt and farmer mac i guaranteed securities 
recognizing that interest rate sensitivity may change with the passage of time and as interest rates change  farmer mac assesses this exposure on a regular basis and  if necessary  readjusts its portfolio of assets and liabilities by o purchasing mortgage assets in the ordinary course of business  o refunding existing liabilities  or o using derivatives to alter the characteristics of existing assets or liabilities 
the most comprehensive stress test of farmer mac s exposure to long term interest rate risk is the measurement of the sensitivity of its market value of equity mve to yield curve shocks 
mve represents the present value of all future cash flows from on and off balance sheet assets  liabilities and financial derivatives  discounted at current interest rates and spreads 
the following schedule summarizes the results of farmer mac s mve sensitivity analysis as of december  and december  to an immediate and instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve 
percentage change in mve from base case as of december  interest rate scenario bp bp bp bp bp n a bp n a n a as of the dates indicated  a parallel shift of the u 
s 
treasury yield curve by the number of basis points indicated produced negative interest rates for maturities of years and shorter 
as measured by this mve analysis  farmer mac s long term interest rate sensitivity increased somewhat during  but remained at relatively low levels despite the significant change in the slope of the yield curve that occurred during the year 
farmer mac s effective duration gap was plus months as of december   compared to minus months as of december  as of december   a uniform or parallel increase of basis points would have increased net interest income nii by percent  while a parallel decrease of basis points would have decreased nii by percent 
farmer mac also measures the sensitivity of both mve and nii to a variety of non parallel interest rate shocks  including flattening and steepening yield curve scenarios 
as of december   both mve and nii showed similar sensitivity to non parallel shocks as to the parallel shocks 
the sensitivity of farmer mac s mve and nii to both parallel and non parallel interest rate shocks  and its duration gap  indicate the effectiveness of farmer mac s approach to managing its interest rate risk exposures 
the economic effects of financial derivatives  including interest rate swaps  are included in the mve  nii and duration gap analyses 
farmer mac generally enters into various interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk as follows o floating to fixed interest rate swaps in which it pays fixed rates of interest to  and receives floating rates of interest from  counterparties  these swaps adjust the characteristics of short term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of longer term reset and fixed rate mortgages and other assets and may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market  o fixed to floating interest rate swaps in which it receives fixed rates of interest from  and pays floating rates of interest to  counterparties  these transactions adjust the characteristics of long term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of short term or floating rate assets  and o basis swaps in which it pays variable rates of interest based on one index to  and receives variable rates of interest based on another index from  counterparties  these swaps alter interest rate indices of liabilities to match those of assets  and vice versa 
as of december   farmer mac had billion combined notional amount of interest rate swaps  with terms ranging from one to fifteen years  of which million were floating to fixed interest rate swaps  million were basis swaps and million were fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
farmer mac uses financial derivatives as an end user for hedging purposes  not for trading or speculative purposes 
when financial derivatives meet the specific hedge criteria under sfas  they are accounted for as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges 
financial derivatives that do not satisfy those hedge criteria are not accounted for as hedges and changes in the fair value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statement of operations 
all of farmer mac s financial derivative transactions are conducted under standard collateralized agreements that limit farmer mac s potential credit exposure to any counterparty 
as of december   farmer mac had no uncollateralized net exposure to any counterparty 
credit risk loans 
farmer mac s primary exposure to credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their mortgages in conjunction with a deficiency in the value of the collateral relative to the amount outstanding on the mortgage and the cost of liquidation 
farmer mac is exposed to credit risk on o loans it holds  o loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities  and o loans underlying ltspcs 
loans held or loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities or ltspcs can be divided into four groups o loans held for investment  o loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities  o loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or ltspcs  and o usda guaranteed portions underlying farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
for loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities  ten percent first loss subordinated interests mitigate farmer mac s credit risk exposure 
before farmer mac incurs a credit loss  full recourse must first be taken against the subordinated interest 
the act eliminated the subordinated interest requirement 
as a result  farmer mac generally assumes percent of the credit risk on loans held for investment and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac s credit exposure on usda guaranteed portions is covered by the full faith and credit of the united states 
farmer mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure to loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities because of the subordinated interests  or to usda guaranteed portions because of the usda guarantee 
the outstanding principal balance of loans held  real estate owned and loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities including agvantage bonds or ltspcs is summarized in the following table 
as of december  in thousands farmer mac i post act   pre act   farmer mac ii usda guaranteed portions   farmer mac conducts guarantee fee adequacy analyses  using stress test models developed internally and with the assistance of outside experts 
these analyses have taken into account the diverse and dissimilar characteristics of the various asset categories for which farmer mac manages its risk exposures  and have evolved as the mix and character of assets under management has shifted with growth in the business and the addition of new asset categories 
based on current information  farmer mac believes that its guarantee fee is adequate compensation for the credit risk that it assumes 
farmer mac has established underwriting  appraisal and documentation standards for agricultural mortgage loans to mitigate the risk of loss from borrower defaults and to provide guidance concerning the management  administration and conduct of underwriting and appraisals to all participating sellers and potential sellers in its programs 
these standards were developed on the basis of industry norms for agricultural mortgage loans and are designed to assess the creditworthiness of the borrower  as well as the value of the collateral securing the loan 
farmer mac requires sellers to make representations and warranties regarding the conformity of eligible mortgage loans to these standards  the accuracy of loan data provided to farmer mac and other requirements related to the loans 
sellers are responsible to farmer mac for breaches of those representations and warranties that result in economic losses to the corporation 
pursuant to contracts with farmer mac and in consideration for underwriting and servicing fees  farmer mac approved central servicers underwrite mortgage loans for farmer mac in accordance with those standards and other requirements  and service those loans in accordance with farmer mac requirements 
central servicers are responsible to farmer mac for serious errors in the underwriting and servicing of those mortgage loans 
detailed information regarding farmer mac s underwriting and appraisal standards and seller eligibility requirements are presented in business farmer mac programs farmer mac i underwriting and appraisal standards and business farmer mac programs farmer mac i sellers 
farmer mac maintains an allowance for losses to cover estimated probable losses on loans held for investment  real estate owned and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended sfas 
the methodology for determining the allowance for losses is the same for loans held for investment and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs because farmer mac believes the ultimate credit risk is substantially the same  ie  the underlying agricultural mortgage loans all meet the same credit underwriting and appraisal standards 
for accepting the credit risk on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  farmer mac receives guarantee fees and commitment fees  respectively 
for loans held  farmer mac receives interest income that includes a component that correlates to its guarantee fee  which farmer mac views as compensation for accepting credit risk 
no allowance for losses has been made for loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act or farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests  which are expected to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans 
usda guaranteed portions collateralizing farmer mac ii guaranteed securities are obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
as of december   farmer mac had experienced no credit losses on any pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or on any farmer mac ii guaranteed securities and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future 
farmer mac s allowance for losses is presented in four components on its consolidated balance sheet o an allowance for loan losses on loans held for investment  o a valuation allowance on real estate owned  which is included in the balance sheet under real estate owned  net of valuation allowance  o a contingent obligation for probable losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs entered into or modified after january   for which inherent losses existed at the time of the guarantee or commitment and could be reasonably estimated  is included in the balance sheet as a portion of the amount reported as guarantee and commitment obligation  and o an allowance for losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  which is included in the balance sheet under reserve for losses 
farmer mac s provision for losses is presented in two components on its consolidated statement of operations o a provision for loan losses  which represents losses on farmer mac s loans held for investment  and o a provision for losses  which represents losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs and real estate owned 
farmer mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins with management s evaluation of the results of its proprietary loan pool simulation and guarantee fee model the model 
the model draws upon historical information from a data set of agricultural mortgage loans recorded over a longer period of time than farmer mac s own experience to date  screened to include only those loans with credit characteristics similar to those on which farmer mac has assumed credit risk 
the results generated by the model are modified by the application of management s judgment  as required to take key factors into account  including o economic conditions  o geographic and agricultural commodity product concentrations in farmer mac s portfolio  o the credit profile of farmer mac s portfolio  o delinquency trends of farmer mac s portfolio  o farmer mac s experience in the management and sale of real estate owned  and o historical charge off and recovery activities of farmer mac s portfolio 
management believes that its use of this methodology produces a reliable estimate of total probable losses  as of the balance sheet date  for all loans included in farmer mac s portfolio  including loans held  real estate owned and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac s methodology for determining its allowance for losses will migrate over time away from the model  to become based on farmer mac s own historical portfolio loss experience 
until that time  farmer mac will continue to use the results from the model  augmented by the application of management s judgment  to determine its allowance for losses 
in addition  farmer mac specifically analyzes its portfolio of non performing assets loans days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured  in bankruptcy  including loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan  and real estate owned on a loan by loan basis 
this analysis measures impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral for each individual loan relative to the total recorded investment  including principal  interest and advances under sfas in the event that the updated appraisal or management s estimate of discounted collateral value does not support the total investment  farmer mac specifically allocates an allowance for the loan for the difference between the recorded investment and its fair value  less estimated costs to liquidate the collateral 
for this analysis and the allocation of specific allowances  farmer mac reviews o non performing assets loans days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured  in bankruptcy including loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan and real estate owned  o loans for which farmer mac had adjusted the timing of borrowers payment schedules  but still expects to collect all amounts due and has not made economic concessions  and o additional performing loans that have previously been delinquent or are secured by real estate that produces agricultural commodities or products currently under stress 
management believes that the general allowance  which is the difference between the total allowance for losses generated through use of the model and the specific allowances  adequately covers any probable losses inherent in the portfolio of performing loans under sfas farmer mac believes that the methodology described above produces a reliable estimate of the total probable losses inherent in farmer mac s portfolio 
the model o uses historical agricultural real estate loan origination and servicing data that reflect varied economic conditions and stress levels in the agricultural sector  o contains features that allow variations for changes in loan portfolio characteristics to make the data set more representative of farmer mac s portfolio and credit underwriting standards  and o considers the effects of the ageing of the loan portfolio along the expected loss curves associated with individual origination years  including the segments that are entering into or coming out of their peak default years 
farmer mac analyzes various iterations of the model data and considers various configurations of loan types  terms  economic conditions and borrower eligibility criteria to generate a distribution of loss exposures over time for all loans in the portfolio  all to evaluate its overall allowance for losses  and back tests the results to validate the model 
such tests use prior period data to project losses expected in a current period and compare those projections to actual losses incurred during the current period 
the allowance for losses is increased through periodic provisions for loan losses that are charged against net interest income and provisions for losses charged to operating expense and reduced by charge offs for actual losses  net of recoveries 
negative provisions for loan losses or provisions for losses are recorded in the event that the estimate of probable losses as of the end of a period is lower than the estimate at the beginning of the period 
charge offs represent losses on the outstanding principal balance  any interest payments previously accrued or advanced and expected costs of liquidation 
the establishment of and periodic adjustments to the valuation allowance for real estate owned are charged against income as a portion of the provision for losses charged to operating expense 
gains and losses on the sale of real estate owned are recorded in income based on the difference between the recorded investment at the time of sale and liquidation proceeds

as of december   farmer mac s allowance for losses totaled million  or basis points of the outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million basis points as of december  the year to year decrease in this ratio is a result of the overall improved credit quality of the farmer mac portfolio  the strong us agricultural economy  the recent upward trend in agricultural land values and the million year over year reduction in farmer mac s outstanding guarantees and commitments 
as of december   farmer mac s day delinquencies totaled million and represented percent of the principal balance of all loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million percent as of december  from quarter to quarter  farmer mac anticipates the day delinquencies will fluctuate  both in dollars and as a percentage of the outstanding portfolio  with higher levels likely at the end of the first and third quarters of each year corresponding to the semi annual january st and july st payment characteristics of most farmer mac i loans 
as of december   loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs that were days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  in bankruptcy including loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan and real estate owned post act non performing assets totaled million and represented percent of the principal balance of all loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million percent as of december  loans that have been restructured after delinquency were insignificant and are included within the reported day delinquency and non performing asset disclosures

as of december   approximately billion percent of farmer mac s outstanding loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs were in their peak delinquency and default years  compared to billion percent of such loans as of december  the model takes the portfolio age distribution and maturation into consideration 
accordingly  those trends did not cause management to alter the model s projection for the provisions for losses 
as of december   farmer mac analyzed the following three categories of assets for impairment  based on the fair value of the underlying collateral o million of non performing assets  o million of loans for which farmer mac has adjusted the timing of borrowers payment schedules within the past three years  but still expects to collect all amounts due and has not made economic concessions  and o million of performing loans that have been previously delinquent or are secured by real estate that produces agricultural commodities or products currently under stress 
those individual assessments covered a total of million of assets measured for impairment against updated appraised values  other updated collateral valuations or discounted values 
of the million of assets analyzed  million were adequately collateralized 
for assets that were not adequately collateralized  individual collateral shortfalls totaled million 
accordingly  farmer mac allocated specific allowances of million to those under collateralized assets as of december  as of december   after the allocation of specific allowances to under collateralized loans  farmer mac had additional non specific or general allowances of million  bringing the total allowance for losses to million

original loan to value ratios calculated by dividing the loan principal balance at the time of guarantee  purchase or commitment by the appraised value at the date of loan origination or  when available  updated appraised value at the time of guarantee  purchase or commitment are one of many factors farmer mac considers in evaluating loss severity 
other factors include  but are not limited to  other underwriting standards  commodity and farming forecasts and regional economic and agricultural conditions 
loans in the farmer mac i program are all first mortgage agricultural real estate loans 
accordingly  farmer mac s exposure on a loan is limited to the difference between the total of the accrued interest  advances and the principal balance of a loan and the value of the property 
measurement of that excess or shortfall is the best predictor and determinant of loss compared to other measures that evaluate the efficiency of a particular farm operator 
loan to value ratios depend upon the market value of a property with due regard for its income producing potential in the hands of a competent operator 
as required by farmer mac s collateral valuation standards  an appraisal of agricultural real estate must include analysis of the income producing capability of the property and address the income estimate in the market analysis 
debt service ratios depend upon farm operator efficiency and leverage  which can vary widely within a geographic region  commodity type  or an operator s business and farming skills 
as of december   the weighted average original loan to value ratio for all post act loans and loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs was percent  and the weighted average original loan to value ratio for all post act non performing assets was percent

an analysis of farmer mac s historical losses and identified specific collateral deficiencies within the portfolio by origination year indicates that farmer mac has experienced peak loss years as loans have aged between approximately their third and fifth years subsequent to origination  regardless of the year the loans were added to farmer mac s portfolio 
as a consequence of the combination of principal amortization and collateral value appreciation  there are few loans in the portfolio originated prior to with known collateral deficiencies 
while farmer mac expects that there will be loans that have aged past their fifth year that will become delinquent and possibly default  farmer mac does not anticipate significant losses on such loans 
analysis of portfolio performance by commodity distribution indicates that losses and collateral deficiencies have been and are expected to remain less prevalent in the loans secured by real estate producing agricultural commodities that receive significant government support such as cotton  soybeans  wheat and corn and more prevalent in those that do not receive such support 
this analysis is consistent with corresponding commodity analysis  which indicates that farmer mac has experienced higher loss and collateral deficiency rates in its loans classified as permanent plantings 
most of the loans classified as permanent plantings do not receive significant government support and are therefore more susceptible to adverse commodity specific economic trends 
further  as adverse economic conditions persist for a particular commodity that requires a long term improvement on the land  such as permanent plantings  the prospective sale value of the land is likely to decrease and the related loans may become under collateralized 
farmer mac anticipates that one or more particular commodity groups will be under economic pressure at any one time and actively manages its portfolio to mitigate concentration risks while preserving farmer mac s ability to meet the financing needs of all commodity groups 
analysis of portfolio performance by geographic distribution indicates that  while commodities are the primary determinant of exposure to loss  within most commodity groups certain geographic areas allow greater economies of scale or proximity to markets than others and  consequently  result in more successful farms within the commodity group 
likewise  certain geographic areas offer better growing conditions than others and  consequently  result in more versatile and more successful farms within a given commodity group and the ability to switch crops among commodity groups 
farmer mac s methodologies for pricing its guarantee and commitment fees  managing credit risks and providing adequate allowances for losses consider all of the foregoing factors and information 
credit risk institutional 
farmer mac is also exposed to credit risk arising from its business relationships with other institutions including o issuers of agvantage bonds and other investments held by farmer mac  o sellers and servicers  and o interest rate contract counterparties 
agvantage bonds are general obligations of the agvantage issuers and are secured by collateral in an amount ranging from percent to percent of the bond amount 
in addition to requiring collateral  farmer mac mitigates credit risk related to agvantage bonds by evaluating and monitoring the financial condition of the issuers of the agvantage bonds 
outstanding agvantage bonds totaled million as of december   and million as of december  farmer mac manages institutional credit risk related to sellers and servicers by requiring those institutions to meet farmer mac s standards for creditworthiness 
farmer mac monitors the financial condition of those institutions by evaluating financial statements and bank credit rating agency reports and confirms that they maintain adequate fidelity bonds and errors and omissions insurance 
for more information on farmer mac s approval of sellers  see business farmer mac programs farmer mac i sellers 
credit risk related to interest rate contracts is discussed in risk management interest rate risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk other investments 
the credit risk inherent in other investments held by farmer mac is mitigated by farmer mac s policies of investing in highly rated instruments and establishing concentration limits  which reduce exposure to any one counterparty 
farmer mac s policies limit the corporation s total credit exposure  including uncollateralized credit exposure resulting from financial derivatives  to a single entity by limiting the dollar amount of investments with each individual entity to the greater of percent of farmer mac s regulatory core capital or million 
that limitation excludes exposure to agencies of the us government  gses and money market funds 
farmer mac policy also requires each individual entity to be rated in one of the three highest rating categories of at least one nrsro for investments with terms greater than days and in one of the two highest rating categories for investments with terms of days or less 
as of december   farmer mac had investments in commercial paper  corporate debt securities  asset backed securities  auction rate certificates  and preferred stock issued by thirty six entities totaling million 
farmer mac s investments in eighteen of these entities each exceeded percent of farmer mac s core capital the cumulative balance of investments in such entities totaled million  and investments in two of these entities each exceeded percent of core capital 
in addition  as of december   farmer mac held million of securities issued by gses or agencies of the us government and million in three money market investment accounts 
the maximum amount held in any one money market fund investment fund at any time during was approximately million 
as of december   percent of farmer mac s investment portfolio  excluding gse and agency investments  consisted of short term highly liquid investments 
liquidity and capital resources farmer mac has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to support its operations for the next twelve months and has a contingency funding plan to handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to the capital markets 
debt issuance 
section e of farmer mac s statutory charter usc section aa e authorizes farmer mac to issue debt obligations to purchase eligible mortgage loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities and to maintain reasonable amounts for business operations  including adequate liquidity 
farmer mac funds its program purchases primarily by issuing debt obligations  consisting of discount notes and medium term notes of various maturities  in the public capital markets 
farmer mac also issues discount notes and medium term notes to obtain funds to finance its investments  transaction costs and guarantee and ltspc payments 
the corporation s discount notes and medium term notes are obligations of farmer mac only  are not rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization and the interest and principal thereon are not guaranteed by  and do not constitute debts or obligations of  fca or the united states or any agency or instrumentality of the united states other than farmer mac 
farmer mac is an institution of the fcs  but is not liable for any debt or obligation of any other institution of the fcs 
likewise  neither the fcs nor any other individual institution of the fcs is liable for any debt or obligation of farmer mac 
income to the purchaser of a farmer mac discount note or medium term note is not exempt under federal law from federal  state or local taxation 
farmer mac s board of directors has authorized the issuance of up to billion of discount notes and medium term notes of which billion was outstanding as of december   subject to periodic review of the adequacy of that level relative to farmer mac s borrowing requirements 
farmer mac invests the proceeds of such issuances in loans  farmer mac guaranteed securities and non program investment assets in accordance with policies established by its board of directors 
liquidity 
the funding and liquidity needs of farmer mac s business programs are driven by the purchase and retention of loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities  the maturities of farmer mac s discount notes and medium term notes and payment of principal and interest on farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac s primary sources of funds to meet these needs are o principal and interest payments and ongoing guarantee and commitment fees received on loans  farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs  o principal and interest payments received from investment securities  and o the issuance of new discount notes and medium term notes 
farmer mac projects its expected cash flows from loans and securities  other earnings and the sale of assets and matches those with its obligations to retire debt and pay other liabilities as they come due 
farmer mac issues discount notes and medium term notes to meet the needs associated with its business operations  including liquidity  and also to increase its presence in the capital markets in order to enhance the liquidity and pricing efficiency of its discount notes and medium term notes and farmer mac guaranteed securities transactions and so improve the mortgage rates available to farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners 
though farmer mac s mortgage purchases do not currently necessitate daily debt issuance  the corporation continued its strategy of using its non program investment portfolio referred to as farmer mac s liquidity portfolio to facilitate increasing its ongoing presence in the capital markets during to meet investor demand for daily presence in the capital markets  farmer mac issues discount notes in maturities principally ranging from one day to approximately ninety days and invests the proceeds not needed for program asset purchases in highly rated securities 
investments are predominantly short term money market securities with maturities closely matched to the discount note maturities and floating rate securities with reset terms of less than one year and closely matched to the maturity of the discount notes 
the positive spread earned from these investments enhances the net interest income farmer mac earns  thereby improving the net yields at which farmer mac can purchase mortgages from lenders who may pass that benefit to farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners through the farmer mac programs 
subject to dollar amount  issuer concentration and credit quality limitations  the corporation s board of directors has authorized non program investments in o us treasury obligations  o agency and instrumentality obligations  o repurchase agreements  o commercial paper  o guaranteed investment contracts  o certificates of deposit  o federal funds and bankers acceptances  o securities and debt obligations of corporate and municipal issuers  o auction rate securities  o mortgage backed securities  o asset backed securities  o corporate money market funds  and o preferred stock of gses 
as of december   farmer mac was in compliance with the investment authorizations set forth in its investment guidelines

investment balance does not include premiums paid or unrealized gains on the securities 
as a result of farmer mac s regular issuance of discount notes and medium term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the united states  farmer mac has been able to access the capital markets at favorable rates 
farmer mac has also used floating to fixed interest rate swaps  combined with discount note issuances  as a source of fixed rate funding 
while the swap market may provide favorable fixed rates  swap transactions expose farmer mac to the risk of future widening of its own issuance spreads versus corresponding libor rates 
if the spreads on the farmer mac discount notes were to increase relative to libor  farmer mac would be exposed to a commensurate reduction on its net interest yield on the notional amount of its floating to fixed interest rate swaps and other libor based floating rate assets 
farmer mac compensates for this risk by pricing the required net yield on program asset purchases to reflect the cost of medium term notes without regard to the savings that may be achievable in the interest rate swap market 
farmer mac maintains a liquidity investment portfolio of cash and cash equivalents including commercial paper and other short term money market instruments and investment securities consisting mostly of floating rate securities with rates that adjust within one year  which can be drawn upon for liquidity needs 
as of december   farmer mac s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities totaled million and billion  respectively  a combined percent of total assets and percent of total notes payable 
in addition  as of december   farmer mac held a million portfolio of farmer mac ii guaranteed securities backed by usda guaranteed portions that carry the full faith and credit of the us government 
as of december   the aggregate of the farmer mac ii guaranteed securities and the liquidity investment portfolio represented percent of total assets and percent of total notes payable 
during  exclusive of daily overnight discount note issuances the proceeds of which were invested overnight  the average discount note issuance term and re funding frequency was approximately days 
the principal sources of funding for farmer mac s obligations under its guarantees and ltspcs are o the ongoing fees received on its guarantees and commitments o net interest income received on loans and guaranteed securities  and o the proceeds of debt issuance 
farmer mac satisfies its guarantee and purchase commitment obligations by purchasing defaulted loans out of ltspcs and from the related trusts for farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac typically recovers a significant portion of the value of defaulted loans purchased either through borrower payments  loan payoffs  payments by third parties or foreclosure and sale of the property securing the loans 
farmer mac s liquidity position and ready access to the debt markets also provide additional flexibility to meet liquidity needs that result from the uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of required purchases of loans underlying either farmer mac guaranteed securities or ltspcs  should significantly more loans be required to be purchased than in prior periods 
capital requirements 
the act  as amended by the act  establishes three capital standards for farmer mac minimum  critical and risk based 
the minimum capital requirement is expressed as a percentage of on balance sheet assets and off balance sheet obligations  with the critical capital requirement equal to one half of the minimum capital amount 
higher minimum and critical capital requirements were phased in over a transition period  which ended on january   when the highest level of minimum capital became applicable 
the act does not specify the required level of risk based capital 
it directs fca to establish a risk based capital test for farmer mac  using specified stress test parameters 
for a discussion of risk based capital  see business government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards general 
certain enforcement powers are given to fca depending upon farmer mac s compliance with the capital standards 
see business government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards enforcement levels 
as of december  and  farmer mac was classified as within level i the highest compliance level 
the following table sets forth farmer mac s minimum capital requirement as of december  and based on the fully phased in requirements 
december  december  capital capital amount ratio required amount ratio required dollars in thousands on balance sheet assets as defined for determining statutory minimum capital     outstanding balance of farmer mac guaranteed securities held by others and ltspcs     derivative and hedging obligations   minimum capital level   actual core capital   capital surplus   based on the statutory minimum capital requirements  farmer mac s current capital surplus would support additional guarantee growth in amounts ranging from billion of on balance sheet guarantees to more than billion of off balance sheet guarantees and commitments 
furthermore  farmer mac could sell billion of on balance sheet non program assets cash and cash equivalents and investment securities and billion of on balance sheet program assets in order to support further increases of on and off balance sheet program guarantees and commitments 
any transactions would be evaluated for compliance with risk based capital requirements and to optimize farmer mac s return on equity and capital flexibility 
based on the risk based capital stress test  farmer mac s risk based capital requirement as of december  was million and farmer mac s regulatory capital of million exceeded that amount by approximately million 
accordingly  in the opinion of management  farmer mac has sufficient capital and liquidity for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table presents the amount and timing of farmer mac s known fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date as of december  the payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying value adjustments 
one year one to three to over five or less three years five years years total in thousands discount notes   medium term notes      interest payments on fixed rate medium term notes      operating lease obligations     purchase obligations future events  including additional issuance of discount notes and medium term notes and refinancing of those notes  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
for more information regarding discount notes and medium term notes  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
includes amounts due under non cancelable operating leases for office space and office equipment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding farmer mac s minimum lease payments for office space 
includes minimum amounts due under non cancelable agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms 
these agreements include agreements for the provision of internal audit services  consulting services  information technology support  equipment maintenance  and financial analysis software and services 
the amounts actually paid under these agreements will likely be higher due to the variable components of some of these agreements under which the ultimate obligation owed is determined by reference to actual usage or hours worked 
the table does not include amounts due under agreements that are cancelable without penalty or further payment as of december  and therefore do not represent enforceable and legally binding obligations 
the table also does not include amounts due under the terms of employment agreements with members of senior management  nor does it include payments that are based on a varying outstanding loan volume such as servicing fees  as those payments are not known fixed and determinable contractual obligations 
see the tables below in this section for information about farmer mac s commitments to purchase loans and farmer mac s contingent obligations under outstanding farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac enters into financial derivative contracts under which it either receives cash from counterparties  or is required to pay cash to them  depending on changes in interest rates 
financial derivatives are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value  representing the net present value of expected future cash payments or receipts based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair values of the contracts change daily as market interest rates change 
because the financial derivative liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under the financial derivative contracts  those liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above 
further information regarding financial derivatives is included in note h and note to the consolidated financial statements 
in conducting its loan purchase activities  farmer mac enters into mandatory and optional delivery commitments to purchase agricultural mortgage loans and corresponding optional commitments to deliver farmer mac guaranteed securities 
as of december  and  farmer mac had no optional delivery commitments to purchase loans or deliver farmer mac guaranteed securities outstanding 
in conducting its ltspc activities  farmer mac enters into arrangements whereby it commits to buy agricultural mortgage loans at an undetermined future date 
the following table presents these significant commitments 
as of december  in thousands ltspcs   mandatory commitments to purchase loans and usda guaranteed portions   further information regarding commitments to purchase and sell agricultural mortgage loans is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
farmer mac also may have liabilities that arise from its farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac guaranteed securities are issued through trusts and  when sold to third party investors  accordingly  are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
in performing its obligations related to ltspcs and farmer mac guaranteed securities  farmer mac would have the right to enforce the underlying agricultural mortgage loans  and in the event of the default under the terms of those loans  would have access to the underlying collateral

regulatory matters regulatory actions continue to affect farmer mac s business outlook 
both fca and fcsic have cautioned fcs institutions about doing business with gses  including farmer mac  and fcsic has raised technical objections to fcs institutions use of farmer mac guaranteed securities swaps 
during second quarter  fca published a proposed regulation relating to farmer mac s investments and liquidity 
farmer mac expects to be able to comply with the regulation if it is adopted in its current form  though analysis indicates it could limit future increases in farmer mac s non program investment portfolio and the related net interest income 
the corporation disagrees with certain aspects of the proposed regulation and submitted comments on the proposal to fca accordingly 
on august   fca published a proposed regulation that  if adopted as proposed  could adversely affect farmer mac s business by establishing a new risk weight allocation of capital applicable to farmer mac transactions with fcs institutions  a major segment of farmer mac s customer base 
the proposed regulation would require fcs institutions to risk weight assets on their books that are guaranteed by a gse based on the financial strength rating of the gse  as determined by an nrsro 
under the proposed regulation a the percent risk weight would apply to such assets only if the gse guarantor had a aaa or aa rating from an nrsro  b an a rating would result in a percent risk weight  and c a lower rating or no rating would result in a percent risk weight 
farmer mac is currently unrated 
currently  all banking regulators and fca accord a percent risk weight to assets backed by guarantees of gses such as fannie mae  freddie mac or farmer mac 
the proposed regulation is subject to a day public comment period and  as drafted  would have an effective date eighteen months after the final regulation is published 
if the proposed regulation is adopted as a final rule in its current form and farmer mac does not receive a rating of at least aa within the period provided for in the proposed regulation  the benefit to an fcs institution of doing business with farmer mac would be diminished after the adoption of the regulation  and a significant portion of the current billion of outstanding farmer mac i guarantees and commitments currently in place with fcs institutions might be subject to early termination 
there can be no assurance that the regulation will not be adopted as a final rule in its current form  or in a modified form with substantially the same effect 
likewise  farmer mac currently is not rated  and there can be no assurance that farmer mac would receive a aaa or aa rating from an nrsro 
as set forth in prior disclosures  farmer mac disagrees with the proposed regulation as it would affect the corporation  and has submitted a comment letter to fca setting forth its position 
other matters new accounting standards 
on january   farmer mac adopted the liability recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin which requires farmer mac to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of its obligation to stand ready to perform under the terms of each guarantee agreement and an asset that is equal to the fair value of the fees that will be received over the life of each guarantee 
subsequently  both the asset and the liability are measured and recorded at their fair value 
in december of  the sec provided additional guidance on the day two accounting for these financial instruments 
in accordance with this guidance  farmer mac has adopted the amortized cost model for day two accounting 
this guidance was applied prospectively for guarantees and commitments recorded at december  and all guarantees and commitments issued or modified on or after january  in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
specifically  sop limits the yield that may be accreted and prohibits the carry over of a valuation allowance for all impaired loans that are within the scope of sop sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  farmer mac is evaluating the impact of sop  and will adopt it when effective 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf amended eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment  to introduce a three step model to determine whether an investment is impaired  evaluate whether the impairment is other than temporary  and account for other than temporary impairments 
in part  this amendment requires companies to apply qualitative and quantitative measures to determine whether a decline in the fair value of a security is other than temporary 
the guidance in eitf is effective for reporting periods beginning after june   with the exception of certain sections  which have been deferred 
farmer mac is evaluating the impact of the amendment and will adopt it when it is effective in full 
in the interim  farmer mac continues to apply earlier authoritative accounting guidance  primarily statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  for the measurement and recognition of other than temporary impairment of its debt and equity securities 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
sfas r eliminates the alternative to use apb s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas as originally issued 
currently  as discussed in note m  farmer mac accounts for its stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options pursuant to apb and has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas the guidance in sfas r is effective for reporting periods beginning after june  farmer mac is evaluating the impact of sfas r  and will adopt it when effective
