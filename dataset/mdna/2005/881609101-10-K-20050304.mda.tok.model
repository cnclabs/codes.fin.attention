item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations those statements in this section that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements 
business strategy and overview our strategy is to create a geographically focused  value added refining and marketing business that has i economies of scale  ii a low cost structure  iii superior management information systems and iv outstanding employees focused on business excellence in a global market  with the objective to provide stockholders with competitive returns in any economic environment 
beginning in  we entered into a series of acquisitions and strategic initiatives that transformed our competitive position  the composition and geographical focus of our assets and our financial and operating results 
we expanded our refining capacity from  bpd to  bpd through the acquisition of our hawaii and washington refineries in  our north dakota and utah refineries in and our california refinery in to focus on our refining and marketing business  we sold our oil and gas exploration and production assets in and our marine services assets in december for  our goals were focused on i improving profitability by achieving greater efficiencies  ii using cash flows from operations to further reduce debt  and iii allocating capital and turnaround spending to a maintain safe  reliable operations meeting epa clean air act standards  b high return  low cost projects and c further development of systems and people 
during  we achieved the following significant results relative to our goals  which are further described below under results of operations and capital resources and liquidity operating income improved by million to million compared to  reflecting improved reliability  throughput and higher product margins  together with capturing business improvement initiatives 
we used cash flows from operations to prepay both our million outstanding principal balance of the senior subordinated notes due and million of our then outstanding million senior secured term loans  resulting in annual pretax interest savings of approximately million 
our debt to capitalization ratio was reduced to at year end  compared to at the end of our capital and turnaround spending totaled million  of which million was for clean air projects and million was for reliability and safety projects 
during  we will continue to focus on the goals established for in addition  our executive incentive compensation program includes two financial goals to realize million of operating income improvements through business improvement initiatives and to achieve earnings of at least per diluted share 

table of contents several factors during positively impacted industry margins  including improved economic fundamentals in the us and far east  heavy refining industry turnaround activity in the western us during the first quarter and recent changes in product specifications 
increased demand and below average inventory levels for finished products resulted in significantly higher than average industry margins in all of our refining regions 
overall  industry margins during in our market areas averaged above our five year average january  through december  
we determine our five year average by comparing prices for gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel and heavy fuel oils products to crude oil prices in our market areas  with volumes weighted according to our typical refinery yields 
our net earnings for also benefited from lower interest expense as a result of debt reduction and refinancing during and additional debt prepayments during results of operations summary our net earnings for were million per basic share and per diluted share  compared with net earnings of million per basic share and per diluted share for the significant increase in net earnings during was primarily due to i higher refined product margins  ii increased throughput levels  iii lower interest expense as a result of debt reduction and refinancing in and additional debt prepayments during  and iv our continued focus on capturing business improvement initiatives 
net earnings for included debt prepayment and financing costs of million aftertax  or per share 
our results also included charges for executive retirement costs of million aftertax  or per share 
net earnings for included the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million aftertax  or per share 
our results also included losses on the sale of our marine services assets and certain retail asset impairments of million aftertax  or per share  voluntary early retirement benefits and severance costs of million aftertax  or per share  and a charge related to the termination of our funded executive security plan of million aftertax  or per share 
our net earnings for were million per basic share and per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million per basic and diluted share for net earnings for were primarily the result of improved product margins and the full year contribution at our california refinery operations 
in  charges for bridge financing fees  associated with the acquisition of the california refinery  totaled million aftertax  or per share 
our results also included losses on asset sales and impairment of goodwill  which totaled million aftertax  or per share  and severance and integration costs of million aftertax  or per share 
in  our income tax refund claims reduced previously recognized income tax credits by million  or per share  and a lifo inventory liquidation resulted in decreased costs of sales of million aftertax  or per share 
a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item  together with the following information  are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance

b we experienced reduced throughput during planned major maintenance turnarounds for the following refineries the california refinery during  the alaska  north dakota and utah refineries during  and the california and washington refineries during c volumes and margins for include amounts for the california operations since acquisition on may   averaged over days 
throughput and yield for the california refinery averaged over the days of operation were thousand barrels per day mbpd and mbpd  respectively 
d we define heavy crude oil as alaska north slope or crude oil with an american petroleum institute specific gravity of or less 
e management uses gross refining margin per barrel to evaluate performance  allocate resources and compare profitability to other companies in the industry 
gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies 
management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources 
manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance 
these financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income  revenues  costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
f gross refining margin is calculated as revenues less costs of feedstocks  purchased products  transportation and distribution 
gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel  adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured 
gross refining margin also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market 
in addition  during  certain inventory quantities were reduced resulting in the liquidation of applicable lifo 
table of contents inventory quantities carried at lower costs 
this reduction in lifo inventory decreased costs of sales by approximately million and decreased our net loss by million in g includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately  and for  and  respectively 
h sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries and products purchased from third parties 
total product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes 
compared to operating income from our refining segment increased to million in compared to million in the million increase in our operating income primarily resulted from significantly higher refined product margins  combined with higher throughput levels and product sales volumes 
our total gross refining margin per barrel increased to per barrel in compared to per barrel in  reflecting higher per barrel refining margins in all of our regions 
industry margins on a national basis improved primarily due to increased demand and below average inventory levels for finished products 
improved economic fundamentals in the us and far east resulted in increased demand and margins for finished products and reduced finished product inventory levels 
heavy refining industry turnaround activity in the padd v region during the first quarter of reduced finished product inventory levels on the us west coast 
furthermore  us west coast gasoline supplies tightened in part due to the elimination of the oxygenate mtbe 
margins were lower in all of our refining regions excluding california for the fourth quarter of  compared to the third quarter  primarily due to lower seasonal demand for refined products and higher average crude oil prices 
while refining margins in the california region increased during the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter  we were unable to fully capture these margins due to scheduled downtime at the california refinery as discussed below 
on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margins increased from billion in to billion in  reflecting higher per barrel gross refining margins in all of our regions and higher total refining throughput volumes 
total refining throughput averaged mbpd in  an increase of mbpd or from  despite scheduled turnarounds at our california refinery  which were completed during the fourth quarter  and unscheduled downtime in the first quarter due to a short term power outage and accelerated maintenance of the hydrogen plant 
primarily due to the scheduled and unscheduled downtime at the california refinery  the percentage of lower cost heavy crude oil that we processed of total refining throughput decreased from in to in we estimate that our refining operating income would have been approximately million higher during the fourth quarter  and approximately million higher during the third quarter had the california refinery been fully operational 
in addition  our refining margins at our pacific northwest refineries were negatively impacted during the third and fourth quarters as the increased differential between light and heavy crude oil depressed the margins for heavy fuel oils 
in  our alaska  north dakota and utah refineries experienced reduced throughput during planned major maintenance turnarounds 
revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in  from billion in  primarily due to significantly higher average product sales prices and slightly higher product sales volumes 
our average product prices increased to per barrel and total product sales increased by to average mbpd in from costs of sales also increased primarily due to higher average feedstock prices and slightly higher product sales volumes as compared with expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to increased maintenance  utilities and employee costs of approximately million 
we estimate that the scheduled turnarounds at our california refinery described above resulted in additional operating expenses of approximately million in  included in the estimated million of lower refining operating income described above 
refining throughput and yields in will be affected by scheduled major maintenance turnarounds at our california and washington refineries in the first quarter and the hawaii refinery in the second quarter 
in addition  refining throughput was reduced during january due to unscheduled downtime at our california refinery 
we estimate that our refining operating income was impacted negatively by approximately million 
we currently expect total refining throughput to average approximately to mbpd in 
table of contents compared to operating income from our refining segment was million in compared to million in our results for included a complete year of operating income from the california refinery acquired in mid may the california operations contributed approximately million to our refining operating income during compared to approximately million during our total gross refining margin increased from million per barrel in to billion per barrel in  reflecting higher per barrel gross refining margins in all of our regions and additional throughput volumes from the california refinery  which added an additional mbpd to our total refining throughput in compared to furthermore  us west coast gasoline supplies tightened partially due to changes in gasoline specifications related to the phase out of mtbe in california 
our pacific northwest margins also improved compared to when  during the first quarter  the washington refinery was in a major maintenance turnaround and its heavy oil conversion project was being completed 
the percentage of lower cost heavy crude oil that we processed of total refining throughput increased from in to in  primarily reflecting the additional throughput from the california refinery and completion of our heavy oil conversion project at our washington refinery 
industry margins on a national basis remained volatile during  however  they improved compared to  primarily due to increased demand and below average inventory levels for finished products 
the cold winter in increased demand and margins for distillates during the first quarter 
also  maintenance and operating problems at several other refineries in the industry reduced overall industry finished product inventory levels in during  the refining industry in our market areas experienced the lowest refined product margins since margins were lower in all of our refining regions for the fourth quarter of  compared to the third quarter  due to low seasonal demand for refined products and rapidly rising crude oil prices 
revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in  from billion in  due to increased sales volumes from the california refinery and higher average product sales prices 
total product sales averaged mbpd in  as compared to mbpd in  and average product prices increased to per barrel 
costs of sales also increased due to the additional volumes from the california refinery and higher average prices for refinery feedstocks and purchased product supplies compared with expenses  excluding depreciation  increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to additional operating expenses of approximately million from the california refinery and increased costs for utilities  revenue based taxes and performance bonus expense 
depreciation and amortization increased to million  primarily due to operating the california refinery for the full year

in  bp amoco branded independent jobber dealer stations acquired in the mid continent acquisition did not rebrand to tesoro 
b management uses fuel margin per gallon to compare profitability to other companies in the industry 
fuel margin per gallon is calculated by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volumes and may not be calculated similarly by other companies 
investors and analysts use fuel margin per gallon to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance 
this financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to segment operating income and revenues or any other financial measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
c includes the effect of intersegment purchases from our refining segment at prices which approximate market 
compared to the operating loss for our retail segment was million in compared to operating income of million in total gross margins decreased to million during from million in  reflecting lower fuel margins per gallon and lower sales volumes 
fuel margin decreased to per gallon in from per gallon in  reflecting higher average prices of purchased fuel 
total gallons sold decreased to million from million  reflecting the decrease in average station count to in from in due to our continued rationalization of retail assets 

table of contents revenues on fuel sales increased to million in from million in  reflecting increased sales prices  primarily offset by lower sales volumes 
costs of sales increased in due to higher average prices of purchased fuel  partly offset by lower sales volumes 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat in  as compared to compared to operating income for our retail segment improved by million to million in  compared to an operating loss of million in total gross margins were million in compared to million in reflecting higher fuel margin per gallon  largely offset by lower sales volumes 
fuel margin increased to per gallon in from per gallon in  reflecting increased demand  lower inventories and our efforts to improve operations 
total gallons sold decreased to million  reflecting the decrease in average station count to in from in the decrease primarily was due to selling company operated stations in december acquired with the california refinery in mid may and the fact that bp amoco branded independent jobber dealer stations included in the acquisition of the mid continent refining and retail assets did not rebrand to the tesoro brand 
revenues on fuel sales decreased to million in  from million in  reflecting lower sales volumes from fewer stations  partly offset by increased sales prices 
costs of sales also decreased in due to lower sales volumes  partly offset by higher prices of purchased fuel 
the decrease in operating  selling  general and administrative expenses to million in from million in reflects our initiatives to reduce expenses and the decrease in average station count 
marine services in december  we sold substantially all of the physical assets of marine services 
operating income increased to million during from million in  reflecting higher sales volume and margins  and lower operating expenses 
these operations depended largely on the volume of oil and gas drilling  workover  construction and seismic activity in the gulf of mexico 
see note d and note e in our consolidated financial statements in item for information related to our sale of marine services in and summarized financial information  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of million in increased from million in the increase was primarily due to an additional million for stock based and other incentive based compensation  as well as higher professional fees of approximately million for projects related to driving business excellence 
during  we incurred charges totaling million for voluntary early retirement benefits  severance costs and the termination of our funded executive security plan 
during the fourth quarter of  we expensed million associated with the announced retirement of certain executive officers 
the first quarter will include charges totaling approximately million  primarily related to the termination of certain executive officers 
see notes a and o of the consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding the adoption of the fair value method of accounting for stock options during and other stock based awards granted in selling  general and administrative expenses of million in increased from million in the increase was due to retirement and plan termination charges  as discussed above  totaling million 
excluding these charges  we reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million  through our cost reduction initiatives 
this reduction in expense was net of employees performance bonuses in  which were not awarded in loss on asset sales and impairments the loss on asset sales and impairments of million in consisted primarily of the write off of certain refinery assets that were replaced in connection with the california refinery turnaround of million and the impairment of certain retail assets 
during  the loss on asset sales and impairments of million consisted primarily of the loss on the sale of marine services assets of million  the write off of certain 
table of contents refinery assets that were replaced  and the impairment of certain retail assets 
during  the loss on asset sales and impairments of million consisted primarily of losses on the sale of retail stations and an impairment of retail goodwill 
see note d in our consolidated financial statements in item interest and financing costs interest and financing costs were million in compared to million in the million decrease in was due primarily to lower interest expense associated with debt reduction during and totaling million 
the decrease was also due to the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs in in connection with the replacement of our previous credit facility and voluntary prepayments of other debt 
the decrease during was partly offset by debt prepayment and financing costs totaling million  primarily associated with our voluntary debt prepayments totaling million 
interest and financing costs were million in compared to million in the increase was due primarily to the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs  as discussed above  as well as interest on additional debt that we incurred in may to finance the acquisition of our california refinery 
income tax provision benefit the income tax provision amounted to million in compared to million in the increase reflects significantly higher earnings before income taxes 
the income tax benefit of million in reflects the pretax loss for the combined federal and state effective income tax rates were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in our federal and state effective income tax rate during was primarily due to a change in california state tax law  which eliminated an investment tax credit that had been available in previous years 
in  we elected to carry back net operating losses to recover income taxes paid in previous years  however  the refund of those taxes resulted in the loss of certain tax credits 
the expiration of these credits  along with other adjustments to our estimated liabilities  resulted in a reduced tax benefit of approximately million in capital resources and liquidity overview we operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum products  availability of trade credit  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these risks include  among others  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  worldwide geo political conditions and overall market and economic conditions 
see forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for further information related to risks and other factors 
future capital expenditures  as well as borrowings under our credit agreement and other sources of capital  may be affected by these conditions 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  no borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and million in available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement after million in outstanding letters of credit 
our letters of credit outstanding at december  increased from million at the end of due to increased foreign crude oil purchases and higher average feedstock prices 
we prepaid our million outstanding principal balance of our senior subordinated notes and million of our then outstanding million senior secured term loans during the prepayments will result in annual pretax interest savings of approximately million 
since may  including the debt prepayments during  we have reduced debt by nearly million  decreasing our debt to capitalization ratio from at june  to at december  we believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures  working capital and debt service requirements

credit agreement in september  we amended our credit agreement to i increase its capacity an additional million to million  ii modify the amount of permitted restricted payments and subordinated debt repayments and iii reduce the applicable margins on revolver borrowings 
in addition  the amendment provides the flexibility to obtain up to million in letters of credit outside of the credit agreement for foreign crude oil purchases 
the credit agreement was previously amended in may to increase its capacity by million to million and to extend the term by one year to june the credit agreement currently provides for borrowings including letters of credit up to the lesser of the agreement s total capacity  million as amended  or the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base million as of december   consisting of tesoro s eligible cash and cash equivalents  receivables and petroleum inventories  as defined 
as of december   we had no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility  resulting in total unused credit availability of million  or of the eligible borrowing base 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at either a base rate at december  or a eurodollar rate at december   plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margins at december  were in the case of the base rate and in the case of the eurodollar rate and vary based on credit facility availability 
letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility incur fees at an annual rate tied to the eurodollar rate applicable margin  in the range of to at december  the credit agreement contains covenants and conditions that  among other things  limit our ability to pay cash dividends  incur indebtedness  create liens and make investments 
tesoro is also required to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth 
we are not required to maintain the fixed charge coverage ratio if unused credit availability exceeds of the eligible borrowing base

capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending our capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending totaled million during  compared to million in as discussed below 
capital expenditures during  our capital expenditures excluding refinery turnaround and other major maintenance costs  totaled million  primarily for various clean air  clean fuels and other environmental projects of million and refinery improvements at our california refinery of million  which included control systems modernization totaling million 
other capital spending was primarily for various refinery 
table of contents improvements 
see environmental and other below for additional information regarding capital spending for our clean air  clean fuels and other environmental projects 
based on our latest estimate  we expect our capital expenditures to total approximately to million in excluding refinery turnaround and other major maintenance costs of approximately million 
the capital budget for the refining segment is million  including million for clean air and clean fuel projects  million for control systems modernization and tank reconstruction projects at the california refinery  and other refining projects totaling million 
our retail capital budget is million for we expect to fund the capital spending program from cash flows from operations 
refinery turnaround and other major maintenance during  we spent million for refinery turnarounds and other major maintenance  including million for our scheduled refinery turnarounds 
we expect to spend approximately million in for refinery turnarounds and other major maintenance  including million for scheduled refinery turnarounds primarily at our california  washington and hawaii refineries 
based on our latest estimates  we expect our annual spending for refinery turnarounds to be as follows in millions refinery actual california washington alaska hawaii north dakota utah total long term commitments contractual commitments we have numerous contractual commitments for purchases of crude oil feedstocks  services associated with the operation of our refineries  debt service  pension obligations and leases see notes f  n and p in our consolidated financial statements in item

lease commitments for include lease arrangements with initial terms of less than one year 
represents an estimate of our contractual purchase commitments for the supply of crude oil feedstocks  with remaining terms ranging from three months to years 
prices under these term agreements fluctuate with market responsive pricing provisions 
to estimate our annual commitments under these contracts  we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices  ranging from per barrel to per barrel  as of december   and volumes based on the contract s minimum purchase requirements 
we also purchase additional crude oil feedstocks under short term renewable contracts and in the spot market  which are not included in the table above

these purchase obligations are based on the contract s minimum volume requirements 
we estimated our commitments to purchase power at our california refinery  which has variable pricing provisions  using estimated future market prices 
actual purchases of electricity at our california refinery typically exceed the required minimum volumes 
these commitments also include annual lease payments of million through for a deactivated mtbe plant at our california refinery

tesoro was named a potentially responsible party under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or superfund at this location 
the site was removed from the epa s national priority list and the epa entered into a settlement with third parties to remediate the site 
based on these considerations and recent discussions with the epa  we believe that the likelihood that this matter will have any impact on our results of operations or financial position is remote 
we are currently involved in remedial responses and have incurred and expect to continue to incur cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of sites  including certain of our owned properties 
at december   our accruals for environmental expenses totaled approximately million 
our accruals for environmental expenses include retained liabilities for previously owned or operated properties  refining  pipeline and terminal operations and retail service stations 
we believe these accruals are adequate  based on currently available information  including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation action 

table of contents we are continuing to negotiate a settlement of approximately notices of violation novs issued by the bay area air quality management district 
the novs allege various violations of air quality requirements at the california refinery between may and february reserves for the settlement of the novs are included in the accruals of million referenced above 
we have established reserves for this matter which are not material and we believe that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on march  we finalized a settlement with the bay area air quality management district and the contra costa county district attorney s office concerning three novs we received in march in response to odor incidents at our california refinery 
we have agreed to pay a civil penalty of  to resolve this matter 
reserves for the settlement of the novs are included in the accruals of million referenced above 
other environmental matters in the ordinary course of business  we become party to or otherwise involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental  regulatory and other matters 
large and sometimes unspecified damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be reasonably possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable  and some matters may require years for us to resolve 
as a result  we have not established reserves for these matters and we cannot provide assurance that an adverse resolution of one or more of the matters described below during a future reporting period will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in future periods 
however  on the basis of existing information  we believe that the resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
as previously disclosed  we were a defendant in seven pending cases alleging mtbe contamination in groundwater 
during the fourth quarter  we were named as a defendant in seven additional pending cases  of which we obtained a dismissal without prejudice in four of these cases in february the plaintiffs in each of the remaining pending cases  all in california  are generally water providers  governmental authorities and private well owners alleging that refiners and suppliers of gasoline containing mtbe are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product 
we are being sued as a refiner  supplier and marketer of gasoline containing mtbe along with other refining industry companies 
the suits generally seek individual  unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney s fees  but we cannot estimate the amount or the likelihood of the ultimate resolution of these matters at this time  and accordingly  we have not established a reserve for these cases 
we believe we have defenses to these claims and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuits 
soil and groundwater conditions at our california refinery may require substantial expenditures over time 
in connection with our acquisition of the california refinery from ultramar  inc in may  ultramar assigned certain of its rights and obligations that ultramar had acquired from tosco corporation in august of tosco assumed responsibility and contractually indemnified us for up to million for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to august of  which are identified prior to august  pre acquisition operations 
based on existing information  we currently estimate that the environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations are approximately million  including soil and groundwater conditions at the refinery in connection with various projects and including those required by the california regional water quality control board and other government agencies 
if we incur remediation liabilities in excess of the environmental liabilities for pre acquisition operations indemnified by tosco  we expect to be reimbursed for such excess liabilities under certain environmental insurance policies 
the policies provide million of coverage in excess of the million indemnity covering environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
because of tosco s indemnification and the environmental insurance policies  we have not established a reserve for environmental liabilities arising out of the pre acquisition operations 
in december  we initiated arbitration proceedings against tosco seeking damages  indemnity and a declaration that tosco is responsible for the environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations at our california refinery 

table of contents in november  we filed suit in contra costa county superior court against tosco alleging that tosco misrepresented  concealed and failed to disclose certain additional environmental conditions at our california refinery 
the court granted tosco s motion to compel arbitration of our claims for these certain additional environmental conditions 
in the arbitration proceedings we initiated against tosco in december  we are also seeking a determination that tosco is liable for investigation and remediation of these certain additional environmental conditions  the amount of which is currently unknown and therefore a reserve has not been established  and which may not be covered by the million indemnity for environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
in response to our arbitration claims  tosco filed counterclaims in the contra costa county superior court action alleging that we are contractually responsible for certain environmental liabilities at our california refinery  including certain liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
in february  the parties agreed to stay the arbitration proceedings for a period of days to pursue settlement discussions 
in the event we are unable to reach settlement  we intend to vigorously prosecute our claims against tosco and to oppose tosco s claims against us  although we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail 
during the first quarter of  we began settlement discussions with the california air resources board carb concerning an nov we received in october the nov  issued by carb  alleges we offered for sale eleven batches of gasoline in california that did not meet carb s gasoline exhaust emission limits 
as of december   we could not estimate the amount of any penalties that might be associated with this nov and accordingly  we did not establish a reserve for this matter 
we disagree with factual allegations in the nov and believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter with carb will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
environmental capital expenditures epa regulations related to the clean air act require reductions in the sulfur content in gasoline  which began january  to meet the revised gasoline standard  we spent approximately million in  and we currently estimate we will make additional capital improvements of approximately million through this will permit each of our six refineries to produce gasoline meeting the sulfur limits imposed by the epa 
epa regulations related to the clean air act also require reductions in the sulfur content in diesel fuel manufactured for on road consumption 
in general  the new on road diesel fuel standards will become effective on june  in may  the epa issued a rule regarding the sulfur content of non road diesel fuel 
the requirements to reduce non road diesel sulfur content will become effective in phases between and we have not determined if we will invest the capital necessary to manufacture low sulfur diesel for the non road market in alaska  and we are continuing to evaluate potential projects to manufacture additional non road low sulfur diesel at our hawaii refinery 
our california  washington and north dakota refineries will not require additional capital spending for non road low sulfur diesel 
we spent million in to meet low sulfur diesel standards  and based on our latest engineering estimates  we now expect to spend approximately million in additional capital improvements through to comply with the maximum achievable control technologies standard for petroleum refineries refinery mact ii  we spent million during  primarily to complete the installation of new emission control equipment at our north dakota refinery 
we expect to spend approximately million in additional capital improvements in at our washington refinery 

table of contents estimated capital expenditures described above to comply with the clean air act are summarized in the table below in millions 
actual lower sulfur gasoline alaska hawaii washington north dakota utah california total for lower sulfur gasoline lower sulfur diesel alaska hawaii washington north dakota utah california total for lower sulfur diesel refinery mact ii alaska hawaii washington north dakota utah california total for refinery mact ii total in connection with the acquisition of our north dakota and utah refineries  tesoro assumed the sellers obligations and liabilities under a consent decree among the united states  bp exploration and oil co 
bp  amoco oil company and atlantic richfield company 
bp entered into this consent decree for both the north dakota and utah refineries for various alleged violations 
as the owner of these refineries  tesoro is required to address issues  including leak detection and repair  flaring protection and sulfur recovery unit optimization 
we currently estimate we will spend million over the next three years to comply with this consent decree 
we also agreed to indemnify the sellers for all losses of any kind incurred in connection with the consent decree 
in connection with the acquisition of our california refinery  subject to certain conditions  tesoro also assumed the seller s obligations pursuant to settlement efforts with the epa concerning the section refinery enforcement initiative under the clean air act  except for any potential monetary penalties  which the seller retains 
we believe these obligations will not have a material impact on tesoro s financial position or results of operations 
we will need to spend additional capital at the california refinery for reconfiguring and replacing above ground storage tank systems and upgrading piping within the refinery 
for these related projects at our 
table of contents california refinery  we spent million during  and we estimate that we may spend an additional million through this cost estimate is subject to further review and analysis 
conditions may develop that cause increases or decreases in future expenditures for our various sites  including  but not limited to  our refineries  tank farms  retail gasoline stations operating and closed locations and petroleum product terminals  and for compliance with the clean air act and other federal  state and local requirements 
we cannot currently determine the amounts of such future expenditures 
other union oil company of california has asserted claims against other refining companies for infringement of patents related to the production of certain reformulated gasoline 
our california refinery produces grades of gasoline that may be subject to similar claims 
we have not paid or accrued liabilities for patent royalties that may be related to our california refinery s production  since the us patent office and the federal trade commission are evaluating the validity of those patents 
we believe that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

claims against third parties beginning in the early s  tesoro hawaii corporation  tesoro alaska company and other fuel suppliers entered a series of long term  fixed price fuel supply contracts with the us defense energy support center desc 
each of the contracts contained a provision for price adjustments by the desc 
however  the federal acquisition regulations far limit how prices may be adjusted  and we and many of the other suppliers in separate suits in the court of federal claims currently are seeking relief from the desc s price adjustments 
we and the other suppliers allege that the desc s price adjustments violated far by not adjusting the price of fuel based on changes to the suppliers established prices or costs  as far requires 
we and the other suppliers seek recovery of approximately billion in underpayment for fuel 
our share of the underpayment currently totals approximately million  plus interest 
the court of federal claims granted partial summary judgment in our favor  held that the desc s fuel prices were illegal  and rejected the desc s assertion that we waived our right to a remedy by entering into the contracts 
however  some of the other judges in the same court ruled on the cross motions for other suppliers in conflict with the holding for us 
as a result  we petitioned the court of appeals for the federal circuit to review its claims  and oral arguments in the appeal were held on january  we are seeking the court of appeals validation that the price adjustments were illegal and that we did not waive our right to sue when we entered into the contracts 
we expect to receive the written decision from the court of appeals during the second quarter of  but we cannot predict how the court will rule in this litigation 
in december of  tesoro alaska company filed a protest of the intrastate rates charged for the transportation of its crude oil through the trans alaska pipeline system taps 
our protest asserted that the taps intrastate rates were excessive and should be reduced 
the regulatory commission of alaska rca opened rca docket no 
p to consider our protest of the intrastate rates for the years through through rca s order p  the rca set just and reasonable final rates for the years through  and held that we are entitled to receive approximately million in refunds  including 
table of contents interest through the expected conclusion of appeals in december rca order p is currently on appeal  and we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in the appeal 
in december  the rca opened docket no 
p to consider the justness and reasonableness of the proposed intrastate rates for taps for through the rca s order p order  the rca rejected the taps carriers proposed intrastate rate increases and maintained the permanent rate of to the valdez marine terminal 
order is currently on appeal to the alaska superior court case no 
an ci and the taps carriers did not move to stay order to prevent the rate decrease 
the rate decrease has been in effect since june if the rca s decision is upheld on appeal  we could be entitled to refunds resulting from our shipments from january through mid june if the rca s decision is not upheld on appeal  we could have to pay additional shipping charges resulting from our shipments from mid june through december we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in the appeal 
we also believe that  should we not prevail on appeal  the amount of additional shipping charges cannot reasonably be estimated since it is not possible to estimate the permanent rate which the rca could set  and the appellate courts approve  for each year 
in addition  depending upon the level of such rates  there is a reasonable possibility that any refunds for the period january through mid june  could offset some or all of any repayments due for the period mid june through december accounting standards critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note a in our consolidated financial statements in
