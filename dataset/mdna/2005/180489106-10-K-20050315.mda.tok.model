item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in item of this report under the caption risks relating to our business  and other reports we file with the securities and exchange commission sec 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are an advanced diagnostics technology and services company focused on improving the quality of patient care while reducing medical costs and speeding the discovery of new drugs to treat cancer 
our proprietary automated cellular imaging system acis is a versatile automated microscope system that greatly improves the accuracy and reproducibility of cell imaging through its unique  patented technology 
we also provide comprehensive laboratory services ranging from in house pathology testing using the acis to other cutting edge diagnostic technologies that assist physicians in managing cancer 
in addition  we develop acis based tools for academic and biopharmaceutical company researchers  allowing them to perform cellular level analyses much faster and with improved accuracy 
a number of the top clinical laboratories  hospitals  university medical centers and biopharmaceutical companies in the us and europe have adopted our technology 
the decision to provide in house laboratory services was made in to give us an opportunity to capture a significant service related revenue stream over the much broader and expanding cancer diagnostic testing marketplace while also optimizing the level of service and accuracy provided to remote pathology customers 
our business has historically been focused on the market for breast cancer testing 
while this market is not insignificant  based on our market research we believe that the broader advanced cancer diagnostics market is approximately billion 
our research indicates that this market will approach billion by the end of this decade as a result of the substantial growth that is anticipated for both the incidence of cancer and for the development of new cancer therapies that will require a sophisticated diagnostic test 
we believe that we are positioned to participate in this growth because of our proprietary analysis capabilities  depth of experience of the staff in our diagnostic laboratory  relationships with the pharmaceutical companies  and demonstrated ability to develop unique assays to support these new diagnostic tests 
the initial objective of our service strategy has been to support the expansion of the access program for community pathologists  a rapidly growing customer segment 
the focus of the development of the acis technology platform has been to assist our customers in their diagnosis and treatment of cancer 
we are now exploring numerous ways to leverage our relationship with our customers to better serve their needs and expand revenue opportunities in doing so 
a logical extension of the access technical services has been the recent introduction of other esoteric tests and related professional diagnosis that support the oncology services marketplace 
in order to perform these expanded services  we underwent a rigorous california state inspection process and obtained a california laboratory license in november we are now able to provide a broad spectrum of other laboratory services  which include flow cytometry  molecular diagnostics including pcr polymerase chain reaction  analysis of tumors of unknown origin  expanded services for immunohistochemistry and cytogenetics 
in  we launched our access technical services and the broad complement of additional cancer diagnostic tests in our dedicated laboratory facility in irvine  california 
we have placed an increasing level of importance relative to prior years on the sale of the acis system to research accounts  which include biopharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  and academic medical centers 
we believe that there are more than  such organizations in the us that are good candidates for the acis 
this is a customer group that will be increasingly important for us in the coming years because of the large size of this market and the collaborative development opportunities that these customers provide for the development of new diagnostic tests using acis 
important criteria for these customers include the flexibility and ease of use of the system  the accuracy of the system as a measurement tool in the performance of clinical trials and research studies  and the inclusion of certain key features necessary to researchers such as fluorescence or tissue micro array capabilities 
by seeding the market with acis devices to these customers and working with them on their development activities  we believe that we can help to foster the next generation of applications for acis 
a very important driver of our success in the future will also be our ability to develop new diagnostic tests on the acis  duplicating the success and market penetration that has been achieved within the breast cancer markets  where our market research indicates that as many as of all breast cancer cases in the us are tested using acis 
working in collaboration with many of the top tier pharmaceutical companies  we are developing diagnostic tests and related assays that will target new cancer therapies to those patients most likely to benefit from their use 
we believe the increasing shift towards an aging us population  a group in which cancer incidence is greatest  the large pipeline of targeted cancer therapies in various stages of clinical study  and the increasingly high cost of these drugs will result in a large and ripe market for proven diagnostic tests 
our future success will rest on our ability to develop and introduce these tests using our proprietary imaging technology and to expand our installed base of clinical system placements in the marketplace 
an important component of our strategy is to continue to build and  when necessary  defend our intellectual property position 
currently  we have issued or allowed patents that were approved over known prior art 
seven key us patents cover the major features necessary to develop a competitive image analysis system and cover important system features such as autoloading  whole tissue imaging  multiple magnifications  and thresholds in hue  intensity and saturation 
asserting our intellectual property rights could be critical to supporting our strategy and in advancing our leadership position 
our research and development efforts have been further validated in the area of automated immunohistochemistry for which we have obtained five fda k clearances over the past several years 
these clearances help to validate the efficacy of our technology and to broaden the acceptance of our image analysis 
it will be important for us to obtain fda clearances for our portfolio of new diagnostic tests developed in our bioanalytical services development efforts 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
therefore  on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those provisions for bad debts and reserves 
for estimated bad debts  we review on an individual account basis the age of the receivable  all circumstances surrounding the transaction that gave rise to the receivable and whether the customer continues to have the financial resources to pay the receivable as of the balance sheet date and prior to the issuance of the financial statements for the related period 
this process is followed for both our instrument and laboratory accounts although  because we have out sourced the direct billing and collection of laboratory related receivables  we work closely with our outsourced billing partner to review the details of each laboratory related account 
for acis in progress assets  the respective reserve is based upon the expected future use of the acis components and whether there are any lower of cost or market considerations 
for other obligations  where judgment is required  we review the circumstances surrounding the obligation and evaluate the facts and circumstances to determine an appropriate level of accrual for each obligation 
we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the useful lives are no longer appropriate 
if we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable  the asset is then written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow basis 
included in long lived assets is our acis  which is recorded in property and equipment 
revenue for diagnostic services is recognized at the time of completion of services at amounts equal to those amounts expected for collection from third parties including medicare  insurance companies and  to a small degree  private patients 
these expected amounts are based both on medicare allowable rates and our collection experience with other third party payors 
because of the requirements and nuances of billing for laboratory services  we may invoice these parties amounts that are greater than those allowable for payment  however  as noted  it is only the expected payment from these parties that is recorded as revenue 
revenue for fee per use basis is obtained through the billing information via modem  which accesses the acis database 
revenue is recognized based on the greater of actual usage fees or the minimum monthly rental fee 
under this pricing model  we own most of the acis instruments that are engaged in service and  accordingly  all related depreciation and maintenance and service costs are expensed as incurred 
for those instruments that are sold  we recognize and defer revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements eg  maintenance and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement eg  software license when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  typically twelve months 
revenue on system sales is recognized upon acceptance by the customer  often subsequent to a testing and evaluation period 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue diagnostic services 
revenue for the year ended december  was million 
there is no comparable figure for the prior year as we commenced providing these services in the second quarter of in generating this revenue  we performed over  tests which resulted in an average revenue per test of for the majority of tests performed in our laboratory were related to breast cancer testing and substantially one primary cpt code 
for  medicare reimbursement for this code will likely increase by approximately  which is expected to improve revenue from breast cancer tests 
however  because we will be introducing many new tests in our laboratory facility  the reimbursement rates for which will vary greatly depending on the complexity of the tests performed  the average revenue per test in could differ 
because we will have twelve full months of operations in and because we are now able to offer a more comprehensive suite of advanced cancer diagnostic tests  we anticipate that diagnostic revenues will increase substantially in instrument systems and other 
revenue for this segment  which includes fee per use and system sale revenue  for the year ended december  decreased approximately million or over the comparable period in this was due primarily to a decline in fee per use revenue of million from million in to million in this decline was caused by a reduction in the aggregate number of acis placements and a significant decline in the average monthly revenue for acis placements and remote viewing stations 
the overall reduction in instrument systems revenue was offset in part by an increase in revenue from the sale of systems  which increased million from million in to million in  and revenue generated by our bioanalytical services of million 
the number of systems in the field generating fee per use charges decreased from at december  to at the end of the average monthly revenue for acis placements and access remote viewing stations was approximately  and in  respectively  as compared to  and  for the comparable period in the decline in the average monthly revenue is primarily due to pricing concessions offered to our customers in response to lower reimbursement levels from to these lower reimbursement levels also had an impact on lowering the number of revenue generating systems throughout due to system returns from customers 
the reduction in medicare reimbursement and pricing was most significant for those customers that utilized the access remote viewing stations because their revenues are derived from the professional component of reimbursement declined from approximately per test in to per test in as a result of this significant decline in the professional component of reimbursement and in response to competitive pressures  we decided to lower our fees charged to our access customers to a annual license fee for use of the access software 
because all access customers are also customers of our diagnostic services operation  we are now also able to generate revenue in our diagnostic services business from these customers 
we are now transitioning most of these customers to a web based access program that will not require the approximate  investment that has been made historically for the remote viewing stations that these customers require 
this will eliminate our cost of new access hardware while providing a differentiating technology for these customers that still utilizes the image analysis capabilities contained within our fda approved technology 
reimbursement rates for image analysis testing have increased in compared to we do not believe  however  that fee per use revenue per acis customer will change significantly or that the count of system placements will increase substantially 
system sale revenue for the year ended december  increased due to an increase in the number of units sold 
twelve systems were sold during as compared to six for the comparable period in system sales contributed of total revenue for as compared to for the comparable period in revenue from system sales can fluctuate significantly principally due to the infrequent and limited number of system sales 
we intend to increase our emphasis on selling acis systems to research accounts and anticipate that system sale revenue will increase in the future because of this increased emphasis as well as a result of our recent expansion of a dedicated sales force to these efforts and our continued development of acis system features that are more attractive to this customer segment 
cost of revenue diagnostic services 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million 
there is no comparable figure for the prior year as these services commenced in the second quarter of these costs were very high compared to diagnostic services revenue because of the substantial costs that were incurred to start up our diagnostic services operations 
these costs include the laboratory personnel  equipment  laboratory supplies and other direct costs such as shipping that were required to support the launch and service of this operation 
gross margin for diagnostic services was a loss of million in and was negative primarily as a result of the costs incurred to launch our laboratory operation and the relatively fixed nature of the diagnostic services cost structure 
we believe that as the diagnostic services operation increases in size throughout  margins for this business will increase to target levels of approximately 
however  depending on the pace of the revenue increase for these services it may take anywhere from two to four quarters or longer for us to begin realizing margins of this magnitude 
instrument systems and other 
cost of revenue was million in this amount is less than a increase over cost of revenue in the cost of revenue primarily consists of cost for manufacturing the acis and remote access viewing stations  which includes the cost for direct material  labor costs  and manufacturing overhead  and direct customer support costs 
for fee per use revenue  the cost of the acis is depreciated over a three year time period and for a system sale the entire cost of the acis system is recognized at the time of sale 
as noted above  we are transitioning access customers to a web based access program 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to fully depreciate all of our access remote viewing stations because these will no longer be required to facilitate the web based program 
the charge related to this decision was  gross margins for instrument systems were in as compared to in the reduction was due primarily to lower average revenue per acis system from fee per use systems 
we expect that margins in will be similar to those achieved in general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately million or over the comparable period in the increase included cost increases for new staffing  particularly in the sales force  non cash compensation costs related to our restricted stock grant retention program  relocation for new personnel  legal costs primarily related to litigation  and compliance with sarbanes oxley section requirements 
we expect that these costs will decline in due to the one time nature of many of the cost increases in with the exception of the costs of the sales force which are expected to continue to increase 
diagnostic services administration 
these costs totaled million in and included the costs of senior medical staff  senior operations personnel  consultants and legal resources to facilitate implementation of this new operation 
there were no comparable costs in in  these costs are expected to continue to increase because there will be twelve full months of costs compared to approximately eight in and because of higher collection costs on an anticipated increase in revenue 
collection costs are incurred from a third party billing and collection company that we have engaged to perform these services because of the high degree of technical complexity and knowledge required to effectively perform these operations 
these costs are incurred as a percentage of amounts collected 
in the future  we will consider directly providing these services but have no plans to do so in research and development expenses 
these expenses for the year ended december  decreased by approximately  or  from the comparable period in the decrease is due to a reduction in personnel cost that resulted from a workforce reduction to streamline costs that occurred in the third quarter of this decline was somewhat offset by an increase in patent amortization costs due to a decision to lower the average amortization life of our patent portfolio 
we believe that sufficient resources exist currently to support the development of new features of our technology platform for the clinical and research markets and that these costs will not increase substantially in compared to these new development activities  which are intended to produce features that could expand the volume of clinical tests supported by acis and increase the attractiveness of the acis as a tool for researchers  are important to increasing clinical system test volume  expanding the count of clinical system placements  and increasing research system sales 
we plan to continue some level of research and development costs to continue to improve our technology but would expect that these costs will become a lower percentage of revenue as revenue increases in the future 
other income expense 
other expense for the year ended december  of  was  higher than the comparable figure in and consisted primarily of interest expense from borrowings under our equipment financing facility and our laboratory equipment leasing facility 
this interest cost was partially offset by interest income from our average cash balance throughout the average cash balance was higher than due to our february and march private sales of common stock which raised an aggregate of approximately million of net proceeds 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  instrument systems revenue fee per use 
revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately million or over the comparable period in due primarily to an increase in the aggregate number of acis placements but partially offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue for acis placements and remote viewing stations 
the number of systems in the field generating fee per use charges increased from at december  to the average monthly revenue for acis placements and remote viewing stations was approximately  and  respectively  as compared to  and  in we had focused on placing the acis under a lease arrangement in which the customer is charged based on the number of tests performed  subject to a minimum monthly payment 
the decline in the average monthly revenue is primarily due to pricing concessions offered to our customers in response to lower reimbursement levels and a decline in the monthly minimum revenue amount for certain customers 
also impacting fee per use revenue was an increase in the reserve for sales allowances 
the charge taken against revenue in for sales allowances increased by  over the comparable period in due  in part  to the reduction in the reimbursement paid by medicare to our customers 
system sales 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of approximately million or over the comparable period in of million due primarily to an increase in the number of units sold 
six systems were sold during as compared to four in system sales contributed of total revenue for as compared to for the comparable period in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  was million an increase of approximately million or over the comparable period in of million due primarily to the increase in system placements 
in we reclassified customer service costs to costs of sale rather than development cost  as in prior periods 
this change was made in order to better match these costs with related sales activity 
the effect of this reclassification is approximately million and million  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenue primarily consists of cost for manufacturing the acis  which includes the cost for direct material  labor costs and manufacturing overhead 
for fee per use revenue the cost of the acis is depreciated over a three year time period and for a system sale the entire cost of the acis system is recognized at the time of sale 
the total gross margin  as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december  was as compared to for the comparable period in the gross margin increase is primarily due to the decline in the material costs of our acis system 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses for the year ended december  were million an increase of approximately million or over the comparable period in of million 
the increase includes increased severance and recruiting costs for senior executives of million and increased tradeshow and advertising expenditures of million 
the increase related to these charges was partially offset by decreases related to depreciation and travel of million and million  respectively 
research and development expenses 
these expenses for the year ended december  decreased by approximately  or  over the comparable period in the decrease was due to the reduction in personnel costs as a result of the third quarter workforce reduction which we implemented in order to streamline costs more in line with then current revenue 
other income expense 
other expense for the year ended december  consisted of approximately million of interest expense resulting primarily from borrowings under our equipment financing facility 
the borrowings began in september no such borrowings existed in offsetting the increase in interest expense was approximately  of interest income as compared to million in the higher interest income during was primarily a result of a higher cash balance resulting from our august private sale of common stock 
preferred stock accretion and dividends 
our net loss attributable to common stock for included a charge of million  which included a million charge for a write off of the unamortized discount on the outstanding shares of our series d preferred stock 
no such charge was incurred in due to the conversion of all of the outstanding shares of series d preferred stock into common stock in august  which eliminated charges for accretion of  and dividends on  the series d preferred stock in subsequent periods 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving line of credit 
cash used in operating activities was million in due primarily to our net loss of million 
cash used in investing activities of million consisted of capital expenditures related primarily to purchases of new equipment for the diagnostic services laboratory 
we believe that we have substantially all of the laboratory equipment that is required to support our operating activities for most of and that any significant additions to this equipment would be dependent on a substantial increase in diagnostic service activity during the latter half of the year 
any equipment purchases for laboratory equipment are intended to be funded with our million equipment financing lease line 
the rate of capital expenditures  as it relates to acis and access equipment purchases for  was significantly lower than prior periods due to the slow pace of system placements in this trend is expected to continue in for acis devices and  as noted previously  we will no longer need to fund equipment purchases for the access program 
contract signings and related placements of new systems and sales of systems to the research markets are expected to increase during in addition  because of the return of systems from certain accounts during  we have an increase in the supply of returned equipment that is available for placement with new accounts in the future 
we believe that we will be able to place this supply of returned equipment with new customers over the next months 
we anticipate placing acis instruments with users and charging a fee per use for each time the instrument is used to perform a test or  alternatively  to sell these systems to research customers 
the manufacture of these instruments is expected to require a modest outlay of cash because of the near term supply of returned equipment noted above 
revenues will be recognized over the lease term or  in the event of a system sale  upon customer acceptance of the system 
we intend to fund expenditures for the lease or sale of systems with our current cash resources 
because these resources may not be adequate to support the entirety of our business expansion needs  we intend to increase the ratio of our system sales to per use leases  and we anticipate that the majority of system placements in will be for system sales as opposed to fee per use leases 
the majority of these sales are expected to be to research accounts 
however  we also intend to implement modified sale contracts with certain clinical customers that may include a combination of up front purchase cost and long term per use license fees for future test volumes 
financing activities in included an aggregate of million in gross proceeds from the private placements of common stock and million of debt financing  as described in more detail below 
on february   we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock to safeguard for a purchase price of million 
the warrant issued to safeguard  which is exercisable until march   is currently exercisable to purchase  shares of common stock for an exercise price of per share 
in connection with this private placement transaction  we entered into a registration rights agreement giving safeguard certain rights to have the purchased shares registered under the securities act of  as amended 
on march   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a limited number of accredited investors pursuant to which we sold  shares of common stock  together with warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the warrants issued in this transaction are exercisable for a period of four years after the date of issuance 
safeguard acquired  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for an aggregate investment of million 
each of the purchasers was granted a preemptive right to purchase its pro rata share of of any new equity securities that we may issue on or prior to march  safeguard had previously been granted preemptive rights  which it waived in connection with this financing  except to the extent that it purchased securities in the transaction 
in connection with the financing  we entered into a registration rights agreement giving the investors certain rights to have the purchased shares registered under the securities act of  as amended  and a registration statement covering resales of these securities is currently in effect 
in february  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement with the technology and life sciences division of comerica bank california 
this one year agreement was renewed in january through january  and the amount of this revolving credit agreement was increased to million in march the borrowings under the line of credit will be used for working capital purposes and will bear interest at comerica s prime rate plus one half percent 
the agreement also includes an annual facility fee of  a fee of 
on the unused balance of the line of credit  various restrictive covenants and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
borrowings under the line of credit are guaranteed by safeguard in exchange for a one time fee of  and an amount equal to per annum of the daily weighted average principal balance outstanding under the line of credit 
the renewed agreement now has only one financial covenant related to tangible net worth  which must be greater than through june  and greater than  thereafter 
as of december   million was available under the line of credit 
in august  we entered into a million equipment financing agreement with ge capital 
the loan principal amortizes ratably over a month term 
the borrowings under the equipment financing agreement were used for working capital purposes and bear interest at an annual rate of interest of 
the agreement also provides for an incremental million of financing availability upon reaching certain system placement objectives  various restrictive covenants  maintenance of certain financial ratios and a collateral monitoring fee of  per year 
in september  the entire million available under the financing agreement was borrowed 
as of december   million of debt remains outstanding with approximately million of the debt classified as current and million as long term 
borrowings under the equipment financing agreement with ge capital are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the agreement with ge capital incorporates some of the restrictive covenants and certain other requirements of the comerica revolving credit agreement  including any amendments granted by comerica with respect to the incorporated covenants 
the agreement with ge capital also includes a provision whereby a material adverse change to our financial condition could be considered an event of default 
we believe  however  based on current operations  committed borrowings and our million cash balance as of december   that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants over the next twelve months 
in june  the company entered into a master lease agreement with ge capital for capital equipment financings of laboratory services related equipment 
during  the company financed million of capital equipment under this arrangement  which was recorded as a capital lease obligation 
each lease financing has a term of months and provides for an early purchase option by the company after months at of the cost of the equipment 
in january  ge capital approved additional equipment lease financings of up to million under this master lease agreement for equipment leases during  subject to execution of definitive documentation for each separate equipment lease and subject to ge capital s ongoing review of the company s financial condition at the time of each funding request 
these additional equipment lease financings have a term of months for each equipment purchase and provide for an early purchase option by the company after months for a purchase price equal to of the cost of the equipment 
as of march   the company had financed million of capital equipment under this line  which was recorded as a capital lease obligation 
we currently lease our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility and laboratory services facility under operating lease arrangements 
the lease for the corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility expired in february and we exercised our option to extend the lease six months 
the lease for the diagnostic services facility was entered into in may for a term of one year 
we have extended this lease until the end of august our purchase obligations represent commitments primarily for the purchase of materials for the manufacture of our acis units 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations lab facility obligations total we believe that our existing cash resources  the available million revolving line of credit with comerica bank and the million of availability under our new equipment lease line with ge for financing of our lab expansion  will be sufficient to satisfy the cash needs of our existing operations during the next twelve months and will enable us to stay in compliance with our debt agreements 
however  if we are not able to fully execute our business plans in  such that we experience difficulty with expansion of our diagnostic services or are unable to successfully collaborate with partners for our instrument systems operations  these resources may not be adequate and we may be required to raise more capital 
over the longer term  we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to fund our ongoing operations  development activities  clinical studies and or regulatory activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing when needed or on terms that are favorable to us and our stockholders 
furthermore  if additional funds are raised through an equity or convertible debt financing  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that provide financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support or involve leasing  hedging or research and development services for our business or other similar arrangements that may expose us to liability that is not expressly reflected in the financial statements  except for facilities and automobile operating leases 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such we are not subject to any material financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  we have invested excess cash in short term debt securities that are intended to be held to maturity 
these short term investments typically have various maturity dates which do not exceed one year 
we had no short term investments as of december  two of the main risks associated with these investments are interest rate risk and credit risk 
typically  when interest rates rise  there is a corresponding decline in the market value of debt securities 
fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements because of the short term nature of the securities in which we invest and our intention to hold the securities to maturity 
credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the debt securities will not be able to make principal and interest payments 
we have limited the investments to investment grade or comparable securities and have not experienced any losses on our investments to date due to credit risk 
changes in foreign exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
however  as our international operations grow  we may enter into such arrangements in the future 
effective january   our foreign sales were denominated in euros 
foreign currency denominated sales have not been significant
