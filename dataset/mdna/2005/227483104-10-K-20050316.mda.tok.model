item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and other data  all of which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation including the reclassification of our cross country consulting  inc operations to discontinued operations 
overview we are one of the largest providers of healthcare staffing services in the united states 
our healthcare staffing business segment represented approximately of our revenue and was comprised of travel and per diem nurse staffing  allied health staffing as well as clinical research trials staffing 
travel nurse staffing represented approximately of this business segment s revenue 
other staffing services include the placement of allied healthcare professionals  such as radiology technicians  rehabilitation therapists and respiratory therapists  and the placement of clinical research professionals 
our other human capital management services business segment represented approximately of our revenue and consisted of education and training  and retained physician and healthcare executive search services 
for the year ended december   our revenue and net income as shown on the accompanying consolidat ed statements of income were million and million  respectively 
in general we evaluate the company s financial condition and operating results by monitoring several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of orders  contract bookings  average ftes  price  mix and contribution income see segment data where defined 
we also use measurement of our cash flow generation and operating and leverage ratios to help us assess our financial condition 
our healthcare staffing revenue and earnings are impacted by the relative supply of and demand for nurses at healthcare facilities 
we rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other healthcare personnel who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
shortages of qualified nurses and other healthcare personnel could limit our ability to fill open assignments and grow our revenue and net income 
in general  we believe nurses are more willing to seek travel assignments during relatively high levels of demand for contract employment  and conversely  are more reluctant to seek travel assignments during and immediately following periods of weak demand for contract employment  such as what we have experienced since mid we also believe demand for travel nurse staffing services will be favorably impacted in t he long term by an aging population and an increasing shortage of nurses  although we cannot predict when that will happen 
we operate differentiated nurse recruiting brands consisting of cross country travcorps  medstaff  novapro  cross country local and assignment america to recruit nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
we believe that these professionals are attracted to us because we offer them high levels of customer service  competitive compensation and benefits packages  as well as a wide range of diverse assignments at attractive locations primarily throughout the us notwithstanding the most recent two year increase in the nurse workforce  the nursing shortage is expected to grow over the coming decades 
several factors are expected to contribute to the decline in the supply of rns the rn population is getting older and approaching retirement age 
it is estimated that nursing school enrollment would have to increase annually over the next decade to put enough rns in the pipeline to replace the number of nurses expected to retire 
the capacity of us nursing schools is also constraining the supply of domestically trained nurses 
many rns are leaving the hospital workforce through retirement  death or by choosing careers outside of acute care hospitals or in professions other than nursing 
the relative demand for our services at clients facilities may also affect the profitability of our business 
since the later part of  many hospitals have taken nurse staffing actions that have decreased demand  some of which have been due to budgetary initiatives  which have contracted our revenue 
we believe these decisions have resulted in increased reliance on staff nurse overtime  increased patient to nurse ratios and high wage and compensation increases  including sign on bonuses  by the hospitals 
we also believe that  due to recent economic conditions  where many nurse s spouses have been laid off and severance and unemployment benefits have ended  many part time nurses employed directly by hospitals who would have typically worked two shifts or less per week have increased the number of shifts worked at their hospitals and are doing so at the prevailing hospital wage 
other factors that affect the demand for ou r services are patient occupancy rates 
as occupancy increases  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as occupancy decreases  clients tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees 
additionally  we may experience more competitive pricing pressure during these periods of decreased demand 
in  when looking at these factors  we believe nurses reduced willingness to engage in the travel employment model was most responsible for continued declines in volumes in our nurse staffing business 
while the number of orders for contract nurses improved substantially during from the low point in mid  the level of our contract bookings for future assignments remained below the prior year 
in the near term  we believe these metrics would be favorably impacted by higher than expected in patient hospital admission trends 
longer term  improvement in overall job creation in the economy would provide many staff nurses with increased household income and greater confidence in being able to reduce the amount of regular and overtime hours they provided directly to hospital employers during the last two years 
we believe this would lead to an increase in the demand for our services and encourage more nurses to actively se ek travel assignments and apply with us 
cross country staffing is our core staffing brand that markets its staffing services to hospitals and healthcare facilities as well as operates differentiated recruiting brands to recruit registered nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
in addition to staffing nurses and allied professionals at healthcare facilities throughout the us  cross country staffing is pursuing and implementing exclusive and preferred provider relationships with hospital clients and group purchasing organizations 
cross country staffing provides clients with an integrated suite of solutions to facilitate the efficient management of their temporary workforce while decreasing overall staffing costs 
these solutions include vendor management  interview servicing and technology

discontinued operations on october   cross country sold assets of its jennings ryan kolb jrk and gill balsano consulting gbc practices to mitretek systems  inc mitretek for million in cash plus a working capital adjustment 
the carrying amount of net assets sold was million and consisted primarily of goodwill and other intangibles with a carrying amount of million 
mitretek had approached us with interest in expanding its healthcare consulting presence 
we had been evaluating our commitment to our consulting businesses as a result of significant volatility in these businesses in we recognized a pre tax gain on this transaction of million million after taxes which is included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  net proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down million of term loan debt 
separately  in the fourth quarter of  cross country s board of directors approved a plan to pursue a sale with respect to our cejka consulting practice that was not acquired by mitretek 
cejka consulting was a part of travcorps corporation  which was acquired by cross country healthcare in december cejka consulting  along with the aforementioned disposed practices and some subsidiary level infrastructure costs comprised our cross country consulting  inc ccc inc 
subsidiary  which was a component of our other human capital management services business segment 
we determined that as of december  the ccc inc subsidiary met the criteria to report the pending sale as assets held for sale and the subsidiary as discontinued operations in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company has accounted for ccc inc as such within the consolidated financial statement of income and cash flows and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k filing

as an application service provider  e staff maintained a database of the client s employees on e staff s servers 
however  prospective e staff clients were concerned about placing their health care employees names and credentials on servers owned or controlled by one of the nation s largest healthcare staffing companies 
pursuant to fasb statement no 
 our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the discontinuance of e staff 
the costs and expenses  assets and li abilities of e staff have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
during the first quarter of  we abandoned our efforts to sell the e staff business and decided to dispose of the subsidiary by winding down its operations 
e staff ceased operations as of march  at that time  we determined that approximately million of the net carrying amount of the assets from discontinued operations was impaired 
this impairment charge was taken as a loss from discontinued operations during the year ended december  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets from the acquisition of the assets of our predecessor  cross country staffing  a partnership  as well as from subsequent acquisitions were million and million  at december  we adopted the provisions of fasb no 
as of january  accordingly  goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization

this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our organic healthcare staffing businesses partially offset by a slight increase in our other human capital management businesses

year ended december  compared to year ended december  healthcare staffing revenue from our healthcare staffing business segment decreased million or from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  revenue comparisons are impacted by the acquisition of medstaff on june  excluding the effect of the medstaff acquisition  revenue decreased million  or 
this decrease was due to a decrease in ftes  representing million of the decrease while the remainder was due to price and mix 
for comparison purposes only  on a stand alone basis  medstaff s revenue for the year ended december  decreased by million or compared to the year ended december  on a combined basis  the number of full time equivalents ftes decreased by over the prior year 
excluding the ftes from the medstaff acquisition  the average number of ftes on contract decreased from the prior year 
this decline in volume was due to a decrease in ftes from our travel staffing operations and partially offset by higher ftes in our clinical trials staffing and international recruitment businesses 
as discussed above  our travel nurse operations have weakened throughout and due to a more cautious buying process on the part of acute care hospital customers which reduced the level of demand for our nurse staffing services and resulted in a decline in the number of nurses applying with us for contract travel assignments 
revenue per fte decreased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average bill rates  excluding hospital sponsored pass through bonuses and administrative and co marketing expenses  in our organic nurse staffing business during the year ended december   were lower than the year ended december  our pricing was negatively impacted by co marketing and third party administrative fees as well as a reduction in hospital sponsored pass through bonuses that are accounted for in revenue 
fees relating to the co marketing arrangements we have with group purchasing organizations in which we have exclusive or preferred provider status  and third party administrative fees relating to vendor managed programs are included as an offset to revenue 
we have experienced an increase in co marketing expenses as we secure more preferred provider relationships and an increase in vendor management ser vices being utilized by our customers 
in addition  the mix of business also contributed to the decrease in revenue per fte as the incremental per diem business from medstaff in had lower average bill rates than our organic travel nurse business 
mobile contracts  where the nurse is on the hospital payroll  accounted for approximately of our volume in our healthcare staffing business segment in both the year ended december  and for the year ended december   nurse staffing operations generated of healthcare staffing revenue and was generated by other operations

contribution income from our healthcare staffing segment for the year ended december  decreased or million from million to million 
as a percentage of healthcare staffing revenue  contribution income was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  our profitability was negatively impacted by a decline in the bill pay spread and higher insurance costs 
the increase in direct costs in our travel staffing businesses was not offset by an increase in pricing to our customers 
all of these factors  combined with less leverage on our overhead  contributed to this decrease in contribution income as a percentage of revenue 
other human capital management services revenue from other human capital management services for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the year ended december  this increase was due to higher revenue from both our educational training and search businesses 
the increase in revenues from our educational training business primarily reflects higher seminar attendance in the year ended december  compared to the year ending december  contribution income from other human capital management services for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increased revenues from both our educational training business and our search business combined with improved operating leverage

this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our other healthcare staffing businesses 
including medstaff  the number of ftes increased over the prior year 
excluding the effects of the medstaff acquisition  revenue decreased  million or  from revenue 
this decrease was due to a decrease in the average number of ftes  representing million  an increase in the percentage of ftes working under mobile contracts  representing million  partially offset by an increase in the average hourly bill rate  contributing 
million 
the average number of ftes on contract  excluding the ftes from the medstaff acquisition  decreased 
this decline in ftes was due to a decrease in ftes from our travel nurse staffing operations and clinical research trials business  partially offset by higher ftes in our centralized per diem and international recruitment businesses 
demand for our travel nurse staffing operations continued to decrease during due to a more cautious buying process on the part of acute care hospital customers and full time and part time nurses offering more hours of service directly to hospital employers 
mobile contracts  where the nurse is on the hospital payroll accounted for of our volume in the healthcare staffing business segment in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  although revenue from our developmental centralized per diem and international recruitment businesses increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the increase was partially offset by lower revenue in our clinical research trials staffing business for the same periods 
while improving sequentially during the second half of  ftes from our clinical research trials business decreased on a year over year basis  due to a decrease in demand for clinical research professionals since the beginning of for the year ended december   of our healthcare staffing revenue was generated by nurse staffing operations and was generated by other operations

critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for insurance  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state our accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december   contained herein 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions through december  upon the adoption of fasb statement no 
on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives and performed a transitional impairment analysis as of january   to assess the recoverability of these intangibles  in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
we also completed the annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarters of  and based on the results of the tests  we determined that there was no impairment of continuing operations goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as of december   december   december  and january  the calculation of fair value used in these impairment assessments includ ed a number of estimates and assumptions  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amount of net assets held for sale to determine if the net assets are impaired 
this evaluation can also be triggered by various indicators of impairment which could cause the estimated discounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount of net assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment charge on goodwill reported as discontinued operations of million relating to the cejka consulting business classified as held for sale 
an additional impairment charge of million was also recorded in discontinued operations related to the cejka consulting net assets 
fair value was based on the latest offe r received for the sale of the cejka consulting net assets 
during the year ended december   an impairment charge of approximately million net of a million income tax benefit  was recorded relating to the net assets of e staff and is included in our consolidated statement of income as loss from discontinued operations 
at december   fair value was based on the latest offer received for the sale of e staff at that time and included the estimated cash flows from the sale to a potential buyer  adjusted for the estimated probability of the sale 
in  when we determined that we would wind down operations of the business without a buyer  a further impairment of million was recognized and included in the loss from discontinued operations 
as of december   we had total goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization of million  net of accumulated amortization 
we maintain accruals for our health  workers compensation and professional liability policies that are partially self insured and are classified as accrued employee compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
historically  our accruals for insurance have been adequate to provide for incurred claims 
healthcare insurance accruals have fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment and incre ases in national healthcare costs 
as of december  and december   we had million and million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported health insurance claims 
prior to  only our field employees were covered through a partially self insured health plan  corporate employees were covered through a fully insured plan 
beginning in  the corporate employees were also covered through a partially self insured health plan 
at december   million of the incurred but not reported claim health insurance accrual related to corporate employees 
workers compensation and professional liability insurance accruals have generally increased over time due to the lag times associated with the settlement of claims as well as additional exposures arising from the current policy year 
as of december   we had million accrued for incurred but not reported workers compensation claims and retentions  an increase of million over the amount accrued at december  as of december  and  we had million and million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported professional liability claims and retentions 
the accrual for professional liability is based on an independent actuarial study  which estimated the required professional liability accrual at december  to be in the range of million to million 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
historically losses on uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowances 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
material pending legal proceedings brought against the company  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business  is described in item legal proceedings above 
neither cossack  et al 
v 
cross country travcorps and cross country nurses  inc nor maureen petray and carina higareda v 
medstaff  inc have been certified by a court as a class action 
in addition  the lawsuit brought by maureen petray and carina higareda against medstaff  inc is in its very early stages 
as a result  we are unable to determine our potential exposure regarding these two lawsuits at this time 
we will continue to evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as required 
we are currently not aware of any other such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals at that time 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
fasb statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fasb statement r is similar to the approach described in fasb statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
the compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for public entities excluding small business issuers in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we will adopt fasb statement no 
r on july  using the modified prospective transition method 
we have disclosed the pro forma impact of adopting fasb statement no 
r on net income and earnings per share for the years ended december    and in note summary of significant accounting policies  which includes all share based payment transactions to date 
we expect the impact of the current share based payments outstanding as of december   not to exceed million of compensation expense in this estimate does not include the impact of any share based compensation issued in the fasb believes the use of a binomial lattice model for option valuation is capable of more fully reflecting certain characteristics of employee share options compared to the black scholes options pricing model 
we currently use the black scholes method for disclosures and will be evaluating the binomial lattice model as an alternative 
at this point  we have not decided on which model to use and we do not yet know the impact that any future share based payment transactions will have on our financial position or results of operations 
inflation during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services has exceeded that of the economy as a whole 
this inflation has increased our direct operating costs 
we are also impacted by fluctuations in housing costs and recently by increases in costs of professional  general and healthcare insurance 
depending on the demand environment  we may be able to recoup the negative impact of such fluctuations by increasing our billing rates 
we may not be able to continue increasing our billing rates and increases in our direct operating costs may adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  our clients are impacted by payments of healthcare reimbursements by federal and state governments as well as private insurers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our credit facility  which bears interest based on floating rates 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million in  million in  and million for
