table of contents overview we were formed as a self administered  self managed maryland real estate investment trust  or reit  on may   and commenced operations on september  we are focused primarily on acquiring and operating properties leased to regulated financial institutions 
as banks continue to divest their corporate real estate  we believe that our contractual relationships  growing visibility within the banking industry and flexible acquisition and lease structures position us for continued growth 
we seek to lease our properties to banks and other financial institutions generally using long term triple net or bond net leases  resulting in stable risk adjusted returns on our capital 
our approach is designed to provide banks and other financial institutions with operational flexibility and the benefits of reduced real estate exposure 
we seek to become the preferred landlord of leading banks and other financial institutions through the development of mutually beneficial relationships and by offering flexible acquisition structures and lease terms 
we believe that our strategy gives us a competitive advantage over more traditional real estate companies in acquiring real estate owned by banks and other financial institutions 
we also believe that our recent transactions with bank of america  na wachovia bank  na and state street corporation demonstrate our ability to cultivate and maintain mutually beneficial relationships with leading financial institutions 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of bank branches and office buildings  containing an aggregate of approximately million rentable square feet 
during the year ended december   we acquired interests in properties  containing an aggregate of approximately million square feet  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  million and the issuance of operating partnership units valued at million 
the most significant transactions included the acquisition of a portfolio of properties from wachovia bank  na and properties  including one leasehold interest  from bank of america  na  each aggregating million square feet 
wachovia bank  na has leased approximately million square feet  or approximately of the portfolio for a term of years 
bank of america  na has leased approximately million square feet  or  of the portfolio for a term of years 
other significant acquisitions included the purchase of state street financial center  an approximately million square foot office building in boston s financial district that is leased to a wholly owned affiliate of state street corporation  fremont street  an approximately  square foot office building in san francisco that is leased on a bond net basis by charles schwab co  and independence center  an approximately  square foot office building in charlotte  north carolina that is approximately leased  with bank of america  na occupying of the space as of december  during the year ended december   we sold non core properties  received net proceeds of million and recognized a net gain of million 
in addition  on december   we sold a interest in state street financial center that resulted in a net gain of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we completed several significant financing transactions 
the most significant transaction included a private placement of million in convertible senior notes which bear interest at and mature in we leveraged certain acquisitions  in addition to previously unencumbered properties 
significant transactions included a million credit tenant lease financing secured by state street financial center  a million financing secured by properties in the portfolio we purchased from wachovia bank  na in september and a million credit tenant lease financing secured by our fremont street building 
we also negotiated an increase in the maximum amount available under our secured credit facility from million to million until march  as of december   we had million outstanding under this facility primarily secured by properties in the portfolio we purchased from bank of america  na in october in march  we completed a million secured financing on this portfolio and simultaneously repaid the total outstanding balance on the secured credit facility 

table of contents summarized in the table below are our key portfolio metrics 
the stability and quality of our tenants is key to our strategy  and we saw significant increases in these areas 
contractual rent from financial institutions rose and contractual rent from tenants with an a or better credit rating rose 
contractual rent from net leases rose over and the weighted average lease term rose years to years 
overall occupancy declined from to due principally to the acquisition of properties in at an average occupancy rate below that of our existing portfolio 
december  occupancy contractual rent from financial institutions contractual rent from tenants rated a or better per standard poor s contractual rent from net leases average remaining lease term years includes triple net and bond net leases  as well as other similar leases in which our exposure to operating expenses is capped at the amount that has been  or we expect  will be reached in the near future 
we intend to continue our strategy of acquiring high quality properties through a combination of sale leaseback transactions  specifically tailored transactions  landlord of choice transactions and through our formulated price contracts  and to finance our acquisitions with a combination of equity and debt 
we expect to arrange long term debt primarily on a secured  fixed rate basis 
we intend to continue to grow our existing relationships and develop new relationships throughout the banking industry  which we expect will lead to further acquisition opportunities 
we will also continue to dispose of non core properties that do not meet our continuing portfolio objectives 
significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements 
certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting estimates include revenue recognition our revenues  which are derived primarily from rental income  include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its leases reported on a straightline basis over the initial term of the lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straightline basis accounting requires us to record a receivable  and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
revenues also includes income related to tenant reimbursements for common area maintenance expenses and certain other recoverable expenses that are recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
we continually review receivables related to rent  tenant reimbursements and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt  we record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write off of the receivable in our consolidated and combined statements of operations 

table of contents investments in real estate investments in real estate are recorded at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset 
costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of up to years for buildings and improvements  five to seven years for equipment and fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate these investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which established a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
requires that the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold be presented as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented  and properties intended to be sold to be designated as held for sale on the balance sheet 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition 
these estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income  market and other applicable trends and residual value expected  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
purchase price allocation pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations  we follow the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations 
to ensure that intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase method business combination can be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  we ensure that the applicable criteria specified in sfas no 
are met 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values 
tangible assets include land  buildings  equipment and tenant improvements on an as if vacant basis 
we utilize various estimates  processes and information to determine the as if vacant property value 
estimates of value are made using customary methods  including data from appraisals  comparable sales  discounted cash flow analysis and other methods 
identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquired leases for above and below market lease rates  the value of in place leases  and the value of customer relationships 
amounts allocated to land  buildings  equipment and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio 
depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated life of years for buildings  five to seven years for building equipment and fixtures  and the lesser of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements 

table of contents above market and below market in place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
the aggregate value of intangible assets related to in place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant 
factors considered by us in our analysis of the in place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up period for each property  taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up period  which typically ranges from six to months 
we also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
the aggregate value of intangibles assets related to customer relationship is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the tenant 
characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases  which range primarily from two to years 
the value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases  but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
if a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we utilize a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities  in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
accounting for derivative financial investments and hedging activities we use derivatives to hedge  fix and cap interest rate risk and we account for our derivative and hedging activities using sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction 
cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability  with a corresponding amount recorded in other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income statements in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges under sfas no 

table of contents under cash flow hedges  derivative gains and losses not considered highly effective in hedging the change in expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in the income statement 
for hedge transactions that do not qualify for the short cut method  at the hedge s inception and on a regular basis thereafter  a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivative instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions  eliminating the alternative previously allowed by sfas no 
to use the intrinsic value method of accounting 
the grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of the instruments using methods similar to those required by sfas no 
and currently used by the company to calculate pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures 
the cost will be recognized ratably over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
for the company  sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after june  and the company plans to adopt sfas no 
r as of july  as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  the company will recognize as compensation cost in its financial statements the unvested portion of existing options granted prior to the effective date and the cost of stock options granted to employees after the effective date based on the fair value of the stock options at grant date 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and net loss net loss increased approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to i approximately million of loss relating to the net impact of the properties we did not own during all or part of the year ended december   including the interest expense associated with the financing of certain acquisitions  ii an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately million related to compensation and other employee benefits  the investigation of european expansion opportunities  insurance premiums  marketing  travel  and professional fees  iii a decrease of approximately million related to income from discontinued operations  iv a decrease of approximately million in net interest income from our residential mortgage backed securities portfolio and v approximately million relating to severance and accelerated amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the departure of an executive officer

as a result  in june  in addition to the income we already receive from bank of america  na for the properties  we also began collecting rental income and operating expense reimbursements directly from subtenants that occupy a portion of the returned space and from bank of america  na directly for certain space that it decided to retain

these transactions were completed during the second quarter of loss on investments 
loss on investments was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a loss incurred on the sale of investments in our residential mortgage backed securities portfolio during the year ended december  our portfolio of residential mortgage backed securities was sold in the second quarter of minority interest 
minority interest decreased approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december  this amount represents an allocation of net loss to unitholders in our operating partnership and an allocation of net income or loss from our south broad street and state street financial center properties to individuals who own an and interest in the entities that own those properties  respectively 

table of contents discontinued operations loss from operations

the outperformance plan was approved by the company s board of trustees in may  thus no such expense was incurred during the combined year ended december  interest expense on mortgages and other debt increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million in the combined year ended december  this increase is the result of borrowings used to finance the acquisition of the dana commercial credit and pitney bowes wachovia portfolios and the bank of america  na portfolio acquired on june

discontinued operations totals depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million in the combined year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in the cost basis of the properties we acquired in our formation transactions  to depreciation expense related to properties we acquired following our formation transactions and to amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded in connection with these property acquisitions 
this increase was partially offset by the elimination of depreciation expense related to properties owned by our predecessor entities that we did not acquire in our formation transactions

pursuant to that policy  we generally intend to commence our efforts to dispose of non core properties within days of acquisition and dispose of them within months of acquisition 
if we sell properties at a gain  we may incur income taxes on such gains 

table of contents cash flows for the year ended december  during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
the level of cash flows provided by operating activities is affected by the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the timing of the payment of operating and interest expenses 
the increase in prepaid and other assets principally relates to capitalized financing and acquisition costs associated with transactions pending as of december   which were completed during the first quarter of these transactions include the long term secured financing on the properties acquired from bank of america  na on october  and the purchase of three properties developed by koll development  llc and net leased to an affiliate of citigroup in january the increase in deferred leasing costs is primarily related to the lease inducement fee paid to a subsidiary of state street corporation  the tenant in state street financial center  and a lease extension fee paid to bank of america  na  a tenant in independence center 
these increases were partially offset by the increase in deferred revenue 
the increase in deferred revenue is due to the prepayment of sublease management and standby subtenant fees related to our leasehold interest in harborside and prepaid rent related to properties we did not own on december   including state street financial center and the portfolios we purchased from wachovia bank  na in september and bank of america  na in october net cash used in investing activities was approximately  million

liquidity and capital resources short term liquidity requirements we had an aggregate of million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties  dividend and distribution payments  amortization of indebtedness and related debt service costs 
historically  we have satisfied our short term liquidity requirements through our existing working capital  credit facilities and cash provided by our operations 
we believe that our existing working capital  credit facilities and cash provided by operations will continue to be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements for the next months 
under the terms of our triple net and bond net leases  the tenant is responsible for substantially all expenses associated with the operation of the related property  such as taxes  insurance  utilities  routine maintenance and capital improvements 
as a result of these arrangements  we do not anticipate incurring substantial unreimbursed expenses in connection with these properties during the terms of the leases 
we expect to incur operating and capital expenditures at properties that have tenants with leases that are not written on a triple net or bond net basis 
we also expect to incur capital expenditures  such as tenant improvements allowances and leasing commissions  in connection with the leasing of space in our office buildings 

table of contents long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties and the costs associated with the acquisition of additional properties 
historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  the issuance of equity and equity linked securities  mortgage indebtedness and sales of properties 
in the future  we will be dependent on all such sources to meet our long term liquidity requirements 
as of december  we had approximately million in pending acquisitions  including approximately million relating to three buildings developed by koll development  llc and approximately million relating to the acquisition of an office building in cleveland  ohio  all of which were completed in january the remaining pending acquisitions relate to notifications outstanding under our formulated price contracts of approximately million 
however  since our formulated price agreements require us  with limited exceptions  to purchase all bank branches that the counter parties determine to be surplus properties  the total contractual obligation under these agreements is not quantifiable 
we expect to continue to acquire additional properties in the next months 
we expect to fund such acquisitions with any or all of the sources of capital described above 
we intend to arrange debt in accordance with our general borrowing policies  which often include utilizing our credit facilities prior to securing permanent debt financing and or obtaining up front floating rate interest periods before secured loans revert to a fixed rate for the remainder of the loan term 
on march   we completed a million secured financing on the bank of america  na portfolio acquired in october the financing has a term of years and bears interest at a floating rate equal to libor plus through june   before reverting to a fixed interest rate of approximately for the remainder of the loan term 
we borrowed approximately million of the total financing at closing  and plan to take down the remaining proceeds within days of the initial closing 
we applied substantially all of the initial borrowing to repay in full the outstanding balance on our secured line of credit 
as a result  upon the completion of this financing  over of our outstanding debt is on a fixed rate basis  or will convert to a fixed rate upon the expiration of an initial floating rate interest period

we have provided charles schwab co  inc with an irrevocable  standby letter of credit for million  as security for our obligation under a subtenant agreement and a sublease management and standby subtenant agreement at harborside plaza 
the amount of the letter of credit will increase concurrently with each rent credit and sublease management fee payment by charles schwab co  inc and then decrease over the term of our obligations through october we have also provided bank of america  na with an irrevocable  standby letter of credit for million  as security for our obligations under our lease agreements related to the properties we acquired from bank of america  na in june and october the remaining letters of credit were issued to utility companies in lieu of a cash security deposit to establish service 
we generally intend to refinance the remaining principal balance of our mortgage notes payable as they become due or repay them if they relate to properties being sold 
inflation some of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
these provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures 
we may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions 
in addition  our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance 
this may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to variable rate borrowings 
to meet our short and long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured financings  typically bears interest at fixed rates 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps  caps  and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   our debt included fixed rate mortgages with a carrying value of approximately  million and a fair value of approximately  million 
changes in market interest rates on our fixed rate debt impacts the fair value of the debt  but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow 
the sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate basis point move in interest rates from their december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
as of december   our debt included variable rate mortgage notes payable with a carrying value of million  including million of variable rate debt that will revert to a fixed rate basis on or prior to may the sensitivity analysis related to our variable rate debt assumes an immediate basis point move in variable interest rates with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable notes payable would increase or decrease our interest expense by approximately million annually  adjusting for the effect of our variable rate debt which reverts to a fixed rate basis 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs  and  assume no other changes in our capital structure 
as the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date 
the information represented herein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures  hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations 
risk factors risks related to our business and properties we have recently experienced and expect to continue to experience rapid growth and may not be able to adapt our management and operational systems to respond to the acquisition and integration of additional properties without unanticipated disruption or expense 
as a result of the rapid growth of our portfolio  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt our management  administrative  accounting and operational systems  or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate these properties into our portfolio and manage any future acquisitions of properties without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs 
acquisition of additional properties may generate additional operating expenses that we would be required to pay 
as we acquire additional properties  we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including tenant retention and mortgage default 
our failure to successfully integrate any future acquisitions into our portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 

table of contents we commenced operations in september and completed our initial public offering in june our management has a very limited history of operating a reit and little experience operating a public company  and may therefore have difficulty in successfully and profitably operating our business 
this limited experience may impede the ability of our management to execute our business plan successfully 
we have recently been organized and have a brief operating history 
we will be subject to the risks generally associated with the formation of any new business 
in addition  we recently completed the initial public offering of our common shares 
our management has limited experience operating a reit and in managing a publicly owned company 
therefore  you should be especially cautious in drawing conclusions about the ability of our management team to execute our business plan 
if we are unable to acquire additional properties through our relationships with financial institutions or otherwise  our ability to execute our business plan and our operating results could be adversely affected 
one of our key business strategies is to capitalize on our relationships with financial institutions to acquire additional office buildings and bank branches 
we have agreements with amsouth bank  bank of america  na  r g crown bank and keybank  na to acquire surplus bank branches  however these agreements may be terminated without cause upon days notice  excluding r g crown bank  which may be terminated without cause upon days notice after march  moreover  these agreements only cover surplus bank branches and do not cover each bank s core office buildings and branches 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire desirable office buildings and bank branches and execute our business strategy 
we may be unable to execute our business plan  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
if we are unable to acquire additional properties from banks as a result of changes in banking laws and regulations or trends in the banking industry  we may be unable to execute our business plan and our operating results could be adversely affected 
changes in current laws and regulations governing banks ability to invest in real estate beyond that necessary for the transaction of bank business and changing trends in the banking industry may affect banks strategies with respect to the ownership and disposition of real estate 
for example  banks may decide  based on these changes or other reasons  to retain much of their real estate  sell their bank branches to another financial institution  redevelop properties or otherwise determine not to sell properties to us 
in addition  if our relationships with financial institutions deteriorate or we are unable to maintain these relationships or develop additional relationships  we may be unable to acquire additional properties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current rate of growth by acquiring properties acceptable to us in the future 
if we are unable to acquire additional properties from financial institutions  we may be unable to execute our business plan  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 

table of contents our agreements with financial institutions require us  with limited exceptions  to purchase surplus bank branch properties on an as is basis and  therefore  the value of these properties may decline if we discover problems with the properties after we acquire them 
our agreements with financial institutions require us to purchase surplus bank branch properties on an as is basis 
we may receive limited representations  warranties and indemnities from the sellers and  in certain cases  we may be required to indemnify the sellers for certain matters in connection with our acquisition of such properties 
pursuant to our formulated price contracts with amsouth bank  bank of america  na  r g crown bank and keybank  na  we may be required to purchase properties that have environmental conditions  provided the seller agrees  i in the case of amsouth bank  bank of america  na and r g crown bank  to remediate the environmental conditions or  ii in the case of keybank  to either investigate or remediate the environmental conditions  at keybank s sole election 
if we discover issues or problems related to the physical condition of a property  zoning  compliance with ordinances and regulations or other significant problems after we acquire the property  we typically have no recourse against the seller and the value of the property may be less than the amount we paid for such property 
we may incur substantial costs in repairing a property that we acquire or in ensuring its compliance with governmental regulations 
these capital expenditures would reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
in addition  we may be unable to rent these properties on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to complete in a timely fashion or at all the prospective acquisitions that we publicly announce from time to time  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we have and will continue to publicly announce  through our filings with the sec and through press releases  a number of prospective acquisitions pursuant to which we would acquire additional properties 
our ability to complete these acquisitions is dependent upon many factors  such as satisfaction of due diligence and customary closing conditions and our ability to obtain sufficient debt financing 
our inability to complete these acquisitions or any portion thereof within our anticipated time frame or at all could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
our use of debt financing and our substantial existing debt obligations may decrease our cash flow and put us at a competitive disadvantage 
we have incurred  and may in the future incur  debt to fund the acquisition of properties 
as of december   we had approximately  million of outstanding indebtedness 
increases in interest rates on our existing variable rate indebtedness would increase our interest expense  which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay dividends 
if we incur additional indebtedness  debt service requirements would increase accordingly  which could further adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  our cash available for distribution to shareholders and our equity value 
in addition  increased leverage could increase the risk of our default on debt obligations  which could ultimately result in loss of properties through foreclosure 
since we anticipate that our cash from operations will be insufficient to repay all of our indebtedness prior to maturity  we expect that we will be required to repay debt through refinancings  financing of unencumbered properties  sale of properties or the sale of additional equity 
during the year ended december   we will have to refinance or repay an aggregate amount of approximately million of our existing indebtedness  excluding amounts outstanding under our secured credit facility 
the amount of our existing indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to repay debt through refinancings 
if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms  or at all  we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties on unfavorable terms  which might result in losses to us and which might adversely affect cash available for distributions to shareholders 
if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates on refinancing  interest expense would increase  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 

table of contents we also may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions of real estate 
we may borrow under our credit facilities or otherwise borrow new funds to acquire properties 
in addition  we may incur or increase our mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by some or all of the real estate we acquire 
we may also borrow funds if necessary to satisfy the requirement that we distribute to shareholders at least of our annual reit taxable income  or otherwise as is necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our substantial debt and any increases in our debt may harm our business and our financial results by  among other things requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest  which reduces the amount available for operation of our properties or for the payment of dividends  resulting in violation of restrictive covenants in our loan documents  which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  requiring us to sell one or more properties  possibly on unfavorable terms  and limiting our ability to borrow funds for operations or to finance acquisitions in the future or to refinance our existing indebtedness at maturity on terms as or more favorable than the terms of the original indebtedness 
our reported earnings per share may be more volatile because of the conversion contingency provision of our convertible notes 
in july  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb issued proposed guidance on issue  accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effects on diluted earnings per share 
the eitf reached consensus on the issue in september and the fasb ratified that decision in october this issue will require the inclusion of convertible shares for contingently convertible debt in the calculation of diluted earnings per share using the if converted method  regardless of whether the contingency has been met 
in response to this issue  we entered into a second supplemental indenture to the indenture for our convertible senior notes pursuant to which we irrevocably elected to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of any notes surrendered for conversion with cash 
as a result of this election  the issue would require us to include in our calculation of fully diluted earnings per share only those common shares issuable in satisfaction of our aggregate conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding 
the inclusion of any such shares would cause a reduction in our fully diluted earnings per share for any periods in which such shares are included 
volatility in our share price could cause such common shares to be included in our fully diluted earnings per share calculation in one quarter and not in a subsequent quarter  thereby increasing the volatility of our fully diluted earnings per share 
we may not have sufficient cash to satisfy our conversion obligations in connection with the convertible notes  which may cause us to default under the indenture 
pursuant to the second supplemental indenture to the indenture for our convertible senior notes  we are obligated to satisfy our conversion obligations with respect to the principal amount of any notes surrendered for conversion with cash 
if we are unable to secure enough cash to satisfy these obligations  we may default under the indenture 
in the case of such default  the trustee is authorized to demand that all payments of principal and interest be paid to the trustee for the benefit of the holders and that interest on the overdue principal and interest be paid at the applicable interest rate for the convertible senior notes 

table of contents our use of variable rate debt exposes us to interest rate volatility  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we may experience interest rate volatility in connection with borrowings that bear interest at variable rates 
although we generally seek to place permanent debt financing on our properties on a fixed rate basis  we may seek floating rate financing on our properties when we deem it appropriate 
we also often obtain an up front floating rate interest period on our fixed rate borrowings  such that the loans bear interest at a variable rate for a period of time generally three to twelve months before reverting to a fixed rate for the remainder of the loan term 
we have a secured credit facility and an unsecured credit facility  both of which bear interest at a variable rate 
as of december   million was outstanding on the secured credit facility 
our use of variable rate debt and volatility in interest rates may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
we may seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements 
these arrangements also involve risks  however  and may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes 
we may not have sufficient capital to fully perform our obligations to purchase properties under our agreements with financial institutions  which may subject us to liquidated or other damages or result in termination of these agreements 
our agreements with financial institutions require us  with limited exceptions  to purchase all bank branches that the financial institutions determine to be surplus properties 
if we are unable to accurately forecast the number of properties that we may become obligated to purchase  or if we are unable to secure adequate debt or equity financing to fund the purchase price  we may not have sufficient capital to purchase these properties 
if we cannot perform our obligations  we may become subject to liquidated or other damages or impair our relationships with these institutions 
the institutions with whom we have such agreements may also have the right to terminate the agreements if we breach our obligations under them 
any of these damages could significantly affect our operating results  and if these agreements are terminated  our ability to acquire additional properties and successfully execute our business plan would be significantly impaired 
if we are successful in entering into similar agreements with other financial institutions  we may need a significant amount of additional capital to fund additional acquisitions under those agreements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise necessary capital on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to fund required acquisitions would adversely affect our revenues  impair our business plan and reduce cash available for distribution to shareholders 
failure of our tenants to pay rent could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 
we rely on rental payments from our tenants as a source of cash to pay dividends to our shareholders 
at any time  any of our tenants may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition 
as a result  a tenant may delay lease commencement  fail to make rental payments when due  decline to extend a lease upon its expiration  become insolvent or declare bankruptcy 
any tenant bankruptcy  insolvency  or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant s lease and material losses to our company 
this risk is particularly prominent with respect to our office buildings and our sale leaseback properties  which typically have tenants with larger aggregate lease obligations than our bank branches 
a default by a large tenant on one of these properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as on our ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
in particular  if any of our significant tenants becomes insolvent  suffers a downturn in its business and decides not to renew its lease or vacates a property  it may seriously harm our business 
failure on the part of a tenant to comply with the terms of a lease may give us the right to terminate the lease  repossess the applicable property and enforce the payment obligations under the lease  however  we would be required to find another tenant 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to find another tenant without incurring substantial costs  or at all  or that  if another tenant was found  we would be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms 

table of contents the bankruptcy or insolvency of our tenants under their leases or delays by our tenants in making rental payments could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition 
any bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our tenants could bar us from collecting prebankruptcy debts from that tenant or its property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases  and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt entity may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims 
we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims  which would harm our financial condition 
many of our tenants are banks that are not eligible to be debtors under the federal bankruptcy code  but would be subject to the liquidation and insolvency provisions of applicable banking laws and regulations 
if the fdic were appointed as receiver of a banking tenant because of a tenant s insolvency  we would become an unsecured creditor of the tenant  and be entitled to share with the other unsecured non depositor creditors in the tenant s assets on an equal basis after payment to the depositors of their claims 
the fdic has in the past taken the position that it has the same avoidance powers as a trustee in bankruptcy  meaning that the fdic may try to reject the tenant s lease with us 
as a result  we would be unlikely to have a claim for more than the insolvent tenant s accrued but unpaid rent owing through the date of the fdic s appointment as receiver 
in any event  the amount paid on claims in respect of the lease would depend on  among other factors  the amount of assets of the insolvent tenant available for unsecured claims 
we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
a significant portion of our properties is leased to banks  making us more economically vulnerable in the event of a downturn in the banking industry 
as of december   approximately of our contractual base rent was derived from financial institutions  including regulated banks 
individual banks  as well as the banking industry in general  may be adversely affected by negative economic and market conditions throughout the united states or in the local economies in which regional or community banks operate 
in addition  changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies and laws  including interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  may have an adverse impact on banks loan portfolios and allowances for loan losses 
as a result  we may experience higher rates of lease default or terminations in the event of a downturn in the banking industry than we would if our tenant base was more diversified 
we acquire a substantial number of bank branches  which are specialty use properties and therefore may be more difficult to lease to non banks 
bank branches are specialty use properties that are outfitted with vaults  teller counters and other customary installations and equipment that require significant capital expenditures 
our revenue from and the value of the bank branches in our portfolio may be affected by a number of factors  including demand from financial institutions to lease or purchase properties that are configured to operate as bank branches  demand from non banking institutions to make capital expenditures to modify the specialty use properties to suit their needs  and a downturn in the banking industry generally and  in particular  among smaller community banks 

table of contents these factors may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  if financial institutions do not increase the number of bank branches they operate  do not find the locations of our bank branches desirable  or elect to make capital expenditures to materially modify other properties rather than pay higher lease or acquisition prices for properties already configured as bank branches 
the sale or lease of these properties to entities other than financial institutions may be difficult due to the added cost and time of refitting the properties  which we do not expect to undertake 
if we are unable to lease the bank branches we acquire to financial institutions  we may be forced to sell the branches at a loss due to the repositioning expenses likely to be incurred by non bank purchasers 
we are dependent on certain tenants for a significant portion of our revenues and failure of these tenants to perform their obligations or renew their leases upon expiration may adversely affect our cash flow and ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
as of december   bank of america  na  state street corporation and wachovia bank  na represented approximately  and  respectively  of our portfolio s contractual base rent and occupied approximately  and  respectively  of our total rentable square feet 
the default  financial distress or insolvency of bank of america  state street corporation or wachovia bank  or the failure of any of these parties to renew their leases with us upon expiration  could cause interruptions in the receipt of lease revenue from these tenants and or result in vacancies  which would reduce our revenue and increase operating costs until the affected properties are leased  and could decrease the ultimate value of the affected properties upon sale 
we may be unable to lease the vacant properties at a comparable lease rate or at all  which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
our formulated price contracts with financial institutions may require us to purchase bank branches located in unattractive locations or vacant bank branches that we would not elect to otherwise purchase  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends at historical levels or at all 
we currently have formulated price contracts with amsouth bank  bank of america  na  r g crown bank and keybank  na under our formulated price contracts  we are required  with limited exceptions  to purchase surplus bank branches that these financial institutions own 
we may terminate these agreements without cause upon days written notice  excluding r g crown bank  which may be terminated without cause upon days written notice after march  financial institutions may elect to sell us surplus bank branches under our formulated price contracts for any number of reasons  including  among others  that the properties overlap with other bank branches accumulated in connection with mergers and acquisitions with other financial institutions  have low deposit levels as compared to other branches in their portfolio  are vacant  or are located in unattractive areas 
as a result  we may be required to purchase properties that we otherwise would not elect to purchase outside of our obligations under the formulated price contracts 
the purchase of such bank branches may make it more difficult for us to lease these properties or fulfill our obligations to purchase surplus bank branches under other formulated price contracts  and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 

table of contents our formulated price contracts with financial institutions may require us to purchase a large number of bank branches at any given time that we would not elect to otherwise purchase  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends at historical levels or at all 
since generally there are no limitations on the number or dollar value of properties that financial institutions may sell to us under our formulated price contracts  we may be required to make significant cash expenditures relating to the purchase of a large number of properties at any given time 
these expenditures may significantly deplete our available cash holdings and reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
in addition  we may be unable to effect the acquisition of the bank branches that we are otherwise obligated to purchase under our formulated price contracts through either equity or debt financing 
if we are unable to complete purchases of bank branches under a formulated price contract  we will be deemed to be in default of such contract and may become liable for significant damages as a result of such default 
our inability to fulfill our obligations to purchase surplus bank branches under our formulated price contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
we may be unable to lease properties that we acquire from financial institutions under our formulated price contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
substantially all of the bank branches we acquire through our formulated price contracts with financial institutions are vacant when we are notified of our obligation to purchase  or elect to purchase  the properties 
either because the properties we are obligated to acquire may be unattractive or because we are required to process a large number of properties within a short time period  we cannot assure you that we will be able to lease or sublease any properties that we acquire prior to their acquisition  or at all  or that we will be able to lease or sublease properties on terms that are acceptable to us 
in addition  under our formulated price contracts  we are typically restricted from permitting tenants that compete with the seller from commencing banking operations at a property during the four to six month period after the seller ceases operations at the property 
this restriction could limit our ability to generate revenues from these properties in an acceptable time frame 
when we enter into a lease with a tenant for a bank branch  the tenant typically has a right to terminate its obligations under the lease if it fails to obtain the necessary approvals to operate the bank branch in the location within days 
the tenant s failure to receive these types of approvals during this period  or at all  may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from these properties 
if we fail to lease these properties  they will not generate any revenue for us  which could have a negative effect on our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
similarly  our ability to sublease leasehold interests that we assume is sometimes restricted 
if we are unable to sublease our leasehold interests on terms that are acceptable to us  or if we cannot obtain the consent of the property owner to enter into a sublease  our operating results  cash flow and ability to pay dividends may be impaired 
we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and  if they do not  we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms  or at all  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we cannot predict whether existing leases of our properties will be renewed at the end of their lease terms 
if these leases are not renewed  we would be required to find other tenants for those properties 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 
our inability to enter into new leases on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 

table of contents if we are unable to lease or sublease properties that are partially or completely vacant  we may be required to recognize an impairment loss with respect to the carrying values of these properties  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we may acquire properties that are partially or completely vacant upon acquisition  including surplus bank branches that we acquire under our formulated price contracts 
in addition  any of our properties may become partially or completely vacant in the future 
if we are unable to lease these properties and generate sufficient cash flow to recover the carrying value of these properties  we may be required to recognize an impairment loss  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
as part of our business strategy  we may assume third party lease obligations or sublease properties 
if we are unable to enter into subleases with tenants for such space at rates sufficient to cover our contractual lease or sublease obligations  we may suffer operating losses on such transactions and or be required to reserve against future operating losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our financial covenants may restrict our operating or acquisition activities  which may harm our financial condition and operating results 
the mortgages on our properties contain customary negative covenants  including provisions that may limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the applicable property 
our lines of credit also contain customary covenants that limit our overall borrowings 
these limitations could restrict our ability to acquire additional properties 
in addition  any of our future lines of credit or loans may contain additional financial covenants and other obligations 
if we breach covenants or obligations in our debt agreements  the lender can generally declare a default and require us to repay the debt immediately and  if the debt is secured  can immediately take possession of the property securing the loan 
in order to meet our debt service obligations  we may have to sell properties  potentially at a loss or at times that prohibit us from achieving attractive returns 
failure to pay our indebtedness when due or failure to cure events of default could result in higher interest rates during the period of the loan default and could ultimately result in the loss of properties through lender foreclosure 
we are subject to contractual obligations and covenants that may restrict our ability to dispose of our properties at attractive returns or when we otherwise desire to sell them 
under the partnership agreement of first states partners ii  lp  which owns our south broad street property  we are contractually restricted  until november   from selling or refinancing the property without the consent of the holders of a majority of the minority limited partnership interest in first states partners ii 
as a result of this restriction  we could be precluded from disposing of  refinancing or taking other material actions with respect to our south broad street property during the restricted period  even if we are presented with an opportunity to dispose of or refinance the property on terms that we believe are attractive 
with respect to the properties we acquired from a wholly owned subsidiary of dana commercial credit corporation  we are restricted from selling any individual property in the portfolio so long as the existing master lease for the portfolio is in effect 
pursuant to our agreement with ipc  the minority interest owner of state street financial center  we are restricted from selling both the property or our interest in the property to a third party without first offering to sell the property or our interest in the property to ipc 
in the event that we seek to sell the property rather than our interest in the property and ipc does not elect its right of first refusal  than the purchase price of the third party must meet certain defined criteria 

table of contents pursuant to a contribution agreement under which nicholas s 
schorsch and several other individuals and entities  of which several are our affiliates  contributed approximately million of properties to our operating partnership in exchange for a combination of cash payments and units of our operating partnership  we are required to pay these contributing parties a tax indemnity in the event of a taxable disposition of a property contributed by them prior to an expiration date defined as the earlier of i september  and ii the date on which the contributing parties no longer own in the aggregate at least of the units of our operating partnership issued to them in return for their contribution of property 
the tax indemnity will equal the amount  if any  by which i the amount of the federal and state income tax liability using an assumed combined federal and state income tax rate of incurred by the contributing parties with respect to the gain allocated to the contributing parties under section c of the internal revenue code exceeds ii the present value of the tax liability as of the end of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs  assuming the tax liability is not due until the end of the taxable year in which the expiration date is scheduled to occur 
the discount rate to be used in the present value computation is the prime rate as announced by wachovia bank  na at such time plus basis points per annum 
this tax indemnity could inhibit our disposition of properties that we may otherwise desire to sell and increase the cost of selling those properties  each of which could adversely affect our revenues 
in connection with our acquisition of state street financial center  we are required to pay certain of the sellers who received operating partnership units as consideration in that transaction a tax indemnity in the event of a taxable disposition of that property prior to february  the tax indemnity will equal the amount of federal and state tax income tax liability of such sellers that is due to appreciation in the value of the property prior to its purchase by us  grossed up by the amount of federal or state tax due on the indemnity payments themselves 
in the future  we may become subject to additional contractual obligations and covenants that may restrict our ability to dispose of our properties 
we have a secured credit facility under which the lender will have the right  under certain circumstances  to require that we pledge additional collateral or repay a portion of the outstanding principal on short notice  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
on july   we completed a financing with deutsche bank securities inc  acting on behalf of deutsche bank ag  cayman islands branch  for a million secured credit facility 
advances under this facility are made in the aggregate principal amount of up to of the lesser of either i the maximum amount of subsequent debt financing that can be secured by the properties we acquire with the borrowings under this facility or ii the acquisition cost of those properties 
the lender has the right to reassess this ratio from time to time 
if the lender determines that this ratio exceeds a ratio that the lender deems appropriate based on then current market conditions  the lender may require us to pledge additional qualifying collateral under the facility or repay a portion of the principal outstanding under the facility 
if we do not have additional qualifying collateral or sufficient available liquidity to satisfy the lender s requirements  then we could default on our obligations under the facility and thereby risk foreclosure by the lender on the properties we acquired with the borrowings under this facility or we could incur losses in an effort to raise sufficient liquidity to repay the portion of the principal required by the lender 
on october   we increased the maximum available under this facility to million through march  to allow  under certain circumstances  advances in the aggregate principal amount of up to of the maximum amount of subsequent debt financing that can be secured by the properties we acquire with borrowings under the facility 
we initially financed a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of a bank of america portfolio with approximately million in borrowings from this facility 
as of december   we had million outstanding under this facility 

table of contents we may complete additional debt financings with similar obligations in the future 
increasing competition for the acquisition of real estate may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities  including the acquisition of properties from financial institutions 
such entities include institutional pension funds  other reits  other public and private real estate companies and private real estate investors 
these competitors may prevent us from acquiring desirable properties or increase the price we must pay for real estate 
our competitors may have greater resources than we do  and may be willing to pay more for our acquisition targets 
in particular  larger reits may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from  among other things  a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies 
our competitors may also adopt transaction structures similar to ours  which would decrease our competitive advantage in offering flexible transaction terms 
in addition  the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase  resulting in increased demand and increased prices paid for such properties 
if we pay higher prices for properties  our profitability may decrease and we may experience a lower return on our investments 
increased competition for properties may also preclude us from acquiring those properties that would generate the most attractive returns to us 
the consideration paid for our properties may exceed fair market value  which may harm our financial condition and operating results 
under our formulated price contracts  we are obligated to purchase properties at a formulated price based on independent appraisals using a valuation methodology that values the properties based on their highest and best use and their alternative uses  and then applies a negotiated discount 
therefore  where we ultimately lease or sell a property to a non bank  the fair market value of the property measured with respect to the lease or sale may be less than the purchase price that we paid for the property 
in addition  the consideration that we pay for our properties not acquired under a formulated price contract will be based upon numerous factors and such properties will often be purchased in negotiated transactions rather than through a competitive bidding process 
we cannot assure you that the purchase prices we pay for our properties or their appraised values will be a fair price for these properties  that we will be able to generate an acceptable return on these properties  or that the location  lease terms or other relevant economic and financial data of any properties that we acquire  including our existing portfolio  will meet risk profiles acceptable to our investors 
we may also be unable to lease vacant space or renegotiate existing leases at market rates  which would adversely affect our returns on the affected properties 
as a result  our investments in properties may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations  which may substantially harm our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
we structure many of our acquisitions using complex structures often based on forecasted results for the acquisitions  and if the acquired properties underperform forecasted results  our financial condition and operating results may be harmed 
we acquire many of our properties under complex structures that we tailor to meet the specific needs of the tenants and or sellers 
for instance  we may enter into transactions under which a portion of the properties are vacant or will be vacant following the completion of the acquisition 
if we fail to accurately forecast the leasing of such properties following our acquisition  our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  may be adversely impacted 

table of contents our acquisitions of real estate may result in disruptions to our business as a result of the burden placed on management 
our growth strategy is primarily based on the acquisition of real estate 
such acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention away from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current tenants and employees 
in addition  if we were to acquire real estate indirectly by acquiring another entity  we may be unable to integrate effectively the operations and personnel of the acquired business or to train  retain and motivate any key personnel from the acquired business 
the inability of our management to effectively implement our acquisition strategy may cause disruptions to our business and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
as a result of the limited time during which we have to perform due diligence on many of our acquired properties  we may become subject to significant unexpected liabilities and our properties may not meet projections 
when we enter into an agreement to acquire a property or portfolio of properties  we often have limited time to complete our due diligence prior to acquiring the property 
because our internal resources are limited  we may rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our due diligence 
to the extent we or these third parties underestimate or fail to identify risks and liabilities associated with the properties we acquire  we may incur unexpected liabilities and or the acquired properties may fail to perform in accordance with our projections 
if we do not accurately assess during the due diligence phase the value of  and liabilities associated with  properties prior to their acquisition  we may pay a purchase price that exceeds the current fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired businesses 
as a result  material goodwill and other intangible assets would be required to be recorded or impairment incurred  which could result in significant charges in future periods 
these charges  in addition to the financial impact of significant liabilities that we may assume  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
if third party managers providing property management services for our office buildings or their personnel are negligent in their performance of  or default on  their management obligations  our tenants may not renew their leases or we may become subject to unforeseen liabilities 
if this occurs  our financial condition and operating results  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all  could be substantially harmed 
we have entered into agreements with third party management companies to provide property management services for most of our office buildings  and we expect to enter into similar third party management agreements with respect to office buildings we acquire in the future 
we do not supervise these third party managers and their personnel on a day to day basis and we cannot assure you that they will manage our properties in a manner that is consistent with their obligations under our agreements  that they will not be negligent in their performance or engage in other criminal or fraudulent activity  or that these managers will not otherwise default on their management obligations to us 
if any of the foregoing occurs  our relationships with our tenants could be damaged  which may prevent the tenants from renewing their leases  and we could incur liabilities resulting from loss or injury to our properties or to persons at our properties 
if we are unable to lease our properties or we become subject to significant liabilities as a result of third party management performance issues  our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  could be substantially harmed 
rising operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and funds available for distribution to shareholders 
our properties are subject to operating risks common to real estate in general  any or all of which may negatively affect us 
if any property is not fully occupied or if rents are being paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses  we could be required to expend funds for that property s operating expenses 
our properties are also subject to increases in real estate and other tax rates  utility costs  operating expenses  insurance costs  repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses 

table of contents while many of our properties are leased on a triple net basis or under leases that require that tenants pay all or a portion of the expenses associated with maintaining the properties  renewals of leases or future leases may not be negotiated on that basis  in which event we will have to pay those costs 
in addition  real estate taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 
many us states and localities are considering increases in their income and or property tax rates or increases in the assessments of real estate to cover revenue shortfalls 
if we are unable to lease properties on a triple net basis or on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or some of the expenses associated with maintaining the properties  or if tenants fail to pay required tax  utility and other impositions  we could be required to pay those costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from operations to pay our operating expenses and to pay dividends to our shareholders at historical levels or at all 
we intend to distribute to our shareholders all or substantially all of our reit taxable income each year so as to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on our earnings and to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to reits under the internal revenue code 
we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described herein 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and other factors that our board of trustees may deem relevant from time to time 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends in the future 
our ability to pay dividends is based on many factors  including our ability to make additional acquisitions  our success in negotiating favorable lease terms  our tenants ability to perform under their leases  and our anticipated operating expense levels  which may not prove accurate  as actual results may vary substantially from estimates 
elements of each of these factors are beyond our control and a change in any one or all of these factors could affect our ability to pay future dividends 
we also cannot assure you that the level of our dividends will increase over time or that contractual increases in rent under the leases of our properties or the receipt of rental revenue in connection with future acquisitions of properties will increase our cash available for distribution to shareholders 
in the event of defaults or lease terminations by our tenants  rental payments could decrease or cease  which would result in a reduction in cash available for distribution 
risks related to our organization and structure we depend on key personnel with long standing business relationships  the loss of whom could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of nicholas s 
schorsch  our president  chief executive officer and vice chairman of our board of trustees  and of our management team 
in particular  the extent and nature of the relationships that mr 
schorsch and the other members of our management team have developed with financial institutions and existing and prospective tenants is critically important to the success of our business 
although we have an employment agreement with mr 
schorsch and other key executives  there is no guarantee that mr 
schorsch or the other executives will remain employed with us 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers 
the loss of services of one or more members of our corporate management team  particularly mr 
schorsch  would harm our business and our prospects 

table of contents we may experience conflicts of interest with several members of our management and board of trustees relating to the disposition and operation of our initial properties and operating companies 
conflicts of interest relating to the acquisition of our initial properties and operating companies in september from nicholas s 
schorsch  our president  chief executive officer and vice chairman of our board of trustees  and several other individuals and entities affiliated or associated with us  may lead to decisions that are not in your best interest 
mr 
schorsch  jeffrey c 
kahn  our former senior vice president acquisitions and dispositions  and shelley d 
schorsch  our senior vice president corporate affairs and wife of mr 
schorsch  received  directly or indirectly through their affiliates and family members  approximately of the total consideration received by the sellers in connection with these acquisitions 
the terms of the agreements relating to these acquisitions were not negotiated in an arm s length transaction and it is possible that we could realize less value from these acquisitions than we would have achieved had the acquisitions been entered into with an unrelated third party 
additionally  messrs 
schorsch and kahn and ms 
schorsch have unrealized gains associated with their interests in several of these assets and  as a result  any sale of such assets or refinancing or prepayment of principal on the indebtedness assumed by us in purchasing such assets may cause adverse tax consequences to messrs 
schorsch and kahn and ms 
schorsch 
these individuals may not be supportive of the taxable disposition or refinancing of the properties when it might otherwise be the optimal time for us to do so and such lack of support could affect our decisions as to the timing and structure of any such dispositions or refinancing in the future 
in addition  under the terms of the contribution agreement relating to our acquisition of these properties  we have agreed to indemnify mr 
schorsch and the other parties to the agreement in the event that we sell  transfer  distribute or otherwise dispose of any of these properties in a transaction that would result in the allocation of taxable income or gain by us to the contributing parties under section of the internal revenue code  until the earlier of five years from the date of the acquisition  or the date on which the contributors under the agreement no longer own of the limited partnership interests in our operating partnership that were issued in exchange for the properties 
this tax indemnity will equal the amount of the excess  if any  of the tax liability  assuming a tax rate  on the gain resulting from the disposition of the property  over the present value using a discount rate equal to the prime rate plus of such tax liability to the last day of our taxable year in which the indemnity expires 
as a result of this agreement  we may elect not to sell or transfer these properties in order to avoid payment of the tax indemnity  despite the fact that we would otherwise be able to sell the properties for a significant gain 
several members of our management and board of trustees have the right to approve certain major transactions involving our south broad street property  including its sale  assignment and refinancing  which may result in these individuals acting other than in our best interests 
conflicts of interest relating to our ownership and operation of our south broad street property may occur between us and nicholas s 
schorsch  our president  chief executive officer and vice chairman of our board of trustees and shelley d 
schorsch  our senior vice president corporate affairs and wife of mr 
schorsch  each of whom own a retained interest in this property 
in connection with our acquisition of our initial properties and operating companies  we purchased of the limited partnership interests in first states partners ii  the entity that owns our south broad street property 
mr 
schorsch and ms 
schorsch continue to own a and limited partnership interest in first states partners ii  respectively 
although our operating partnership controls the decisions relating to operations of first states partners ii in its capacity as the owner of the general partner of first states partners ii  the owners of a majority of the minority interest retain the right to approve certain major transactions involving south broad street  including its sale  assignment or refinancing 
these retained rights of mr 
schorsch and ms 
schorsch lead to conflicts of interest between us and these individuals  which could result in decisions that do not fully reflect our interests 

table of contents our board of trustees may authorize the issuance of additional shares that may cause dilution 
our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees  without shareholder approval  to amend the declaration of trust to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of beneficial interest or the number of shares of beneficial interest of any class that we have the authority to issue  authorize the issuance of additional common or preferred shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred shares  or units of our operating partnership which may be convertible into common shares  any or all in connection with future offerings  acquisitions of properties or acquisition of other assets or companies  and classify or reclassify any unissued common shares or preferred shares and set preferences  rights and other terms of such classified or reclassified shares  including the issuance of preferred shares that have preference rights over the common shares with respect to dividends  liquidation  voting and other matters or common shares that have preference rights with respect to voting 
the issuance of additional shares could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders 
our rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our trustees and officers are limited  which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interests 
maryland law provides that a trustee has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith  in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances 
our declaration of trust authorizes us to indemnify our trustees and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the extent permitted by maryland law 
in addition  our declaration of trust limits the liability of our trustees and officers for money damages  except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money  property or services  or a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the trustee or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated 
as a result  we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our trustees and officers than might otherwise exist 
our bylaws require us to indemnify each trustee or officer who has been successful  on the merits or otherwise  in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made a party by reason of his or her service to us 
in addition  we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our trustees and officers 
our ownership limitations may restrict business combination opportunities 
to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  no more than of our outstanding common shares of beneficial interest may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer persons during the last half of each taxable year other than our first reit taxable year 
to preserve our reit qualification  our declaration of trust generally prohibits direct or indirect ownership by any person of more than of the number of outstanding shares of any class of our securities  including our common shares 
generally  common shares owned by affiliated owners will be aggregated for purposes of the ownership limitation 
any transfer of our common shares that would violate the ownership limitation will be null and void  and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares 
instead  such common shares will be designated as shares in trust and transferred automatically to a trust effective on the day before the purported transfer of such shares 
the beneficiary of a trust will be one or more charitable organizations named by us 
the ownership limitation could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control or other transaction in which holders of common shares might receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price or which such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests 
the ownership limitation provisions also may make our common shares an unsuitable investment vehicle for any person seeking to obtain  either alone or with others as a group  ownership of more than in value of our shares 

table of contents our declaration of trust contains provisions that make removal of our trustees difficult  which could make it difficult for our shareholders to effect changes to our management 
our declaration of trust provides that a trustee may only be removed upon the affirmative vote of holders of two thirds of our outstanding common shares 
vacancies may be filled by the board of trustees 
this requirement makes it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing trustees 
our board of trustees may approve the issuance of preferred shares with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue up to  preferred shares  issuable in one or more classes or series 
our board of trustees may classify or reclassify any unissued preferred shares and establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote  participate in earnings and to convert into common shares of any such preferred shares 
thus  our board of trustees could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of the common shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price of our common shares 
maryland law may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
maryland law provides broad discretion to our board of trustees with respect to its fiduciary duties in considering a change in control of our company  including that our board is subject to no greater level of scrutiny in considering a change in control transaction than with respect to any other act by our board 
the maryland business combination act restricts mergers and other business combinations between our company and an interested shareholder 
an interested shareholder is defined as any person who is the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of our common shares and also includes any of our affiliates or associates that  at any time within the two year period prior to the date of a proposed merger or other business combination  was the beneficial owner of or more of our voting power 
a person is not an interested shareholder if  prior to the most recent time at which the person would otherwise have become an interested shareholder  our board of trustees approved the transaction which otherwise would have resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder 
for a period of five years after the most recent acquisition of shares by an interested shareholder  we may not engage in any merger or other business combination with that interested shareholder or any affiliate of that interested shareholder 
after the five year period  any merger or other business combination must be approved by our board of trustees and by at least of all the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares and two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares other than the interested shareholder or any affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder unless  among other things  the shareholders other than the interested shareholder receive a minimum price for their common shares and the consideration received by those shareholders is in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares 
these provisions of the business combination statute do not apply to business combinations that are approved or exempted by our board of trustees prior to the time that the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder 
however  the business combination statute could have the effect of discouraging offers from third parties to acquire us and increasing the difficulty of successfully completing this type of offer 
additionally  the control shares provisions of the maryland general corporation law  or mgcl  are applicable to us as if we were a corporation 
these provisions eliminate the voting rights of shares acquired in quantities so as to constitute control shares  as defined under the mgcl 
our bylaws provide that we are not bound by the control share acquisition statute 
however  our board of trustees may opt to make the statute applicable to us at any time  and may do so on a retroactive basis 

table of contents finally  the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the mgcl permit our board of trustees  without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our declaration of trust or bylaws  to implement takeover defenses that we do not yet have 
these provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price 
our board of trustees may change our investment and operational policies and practices without a vote of our common shareholders  which limits your control of our policies and practices 
our major policies  including our policies and practices with respect to investments  financing  growth  debt capitalization  reit qualification and distributions  are determined by our board of trustees 
our board of trustees may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without a vote of our shareholders 
accordingly  our shareholders will have limited control over changes in our policies 
we have set a targeted level for the amount of net indebtedness debt less unrestricted cash and short term investments that we incur from time to time 
although our target level is approximately of the undepreciated cost of our properties including costs attributable to the purchase of real estate related intangibles  we may amend or waive this target level at any time without shareholder approval and without notice to our shareholders 
for example  as of december  our ratio of net debt to the undepreciated cost of our properties was approximately  and we anticipate that we will continue to exceed our target level of indebtedness for some period of time 
our declaration of trust and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur 
if we become highly leveraged  then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and harm our financial condition 
our executive officers have agreements that provide them with benefits in the event their employment is terminated  which could prevent or deter a potential acquiror from pursuing a change of control of our company 
we have entered into agreements with our executive officers that provide them with severance benefits if their employment ends due to a termination by our company without cause  or by mr 
nicholas s 
schorsch  our president and chief executive officer  if he terminates his employment for good reason 
in the case of such terminations or upon a change of control  the vesting of the restricted shares and options to purchase our common shares held by the executive officers will be accelerated 
these benefits could increase the cost to a potential acquiror of our company and thereby prevent or deter a change of control of the company that might involve a premium price for our common shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders 
risks related to the real estate industry mortgage debt obligations expose us to increased risk of property losses  which could harm our financial condition  cash flow and ability to satisfy our other debt obligations and pay dividends 
incurring mortgage debt increases our risk of property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which we are in default 
for tax purposes  a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure  but would not receive any cash proceeds 
as a result  we may be required to identify and utilize other sources of cash to pay our taxes  which may result in a decrease in cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

table of contents in addition  our default under any one of our mortgage debt obligations may result in a cross default on certain of our other indebtedness or increase the risk of default on our other indebtedness 
if this occurs  our financial condition  cash flow and ability to satisfy our other debt obligations and or ability to pay dividends may be harmed 
illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions is limited 
the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control  including adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of debt financing  changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and ordinances  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  changes in operating expenses  and civil unrest  acts of war and natural disasters  including earthquakes and floods  which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us  or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us 
we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 
these risks can be particularly pronounced with respect to the small  specialty use properties that we may purchase under our formulated price contracts 
we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold 
we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements 
in acquiring a property  we may agree to lock out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions  such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property 
these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
the costs of compliance with or liabilities under environmental laws may harm our operating results 
our properties may be subject to environmental liabilities 
an owner or operator of real property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property 
we may face liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination  the timing of the contamination  the cause of the contamination  or the party responsible for the contamination of the property 
there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
some of our properties use  or may have used in the past  underground tanks for the storage of petroleum based or waste products that have released  or could create a potential for release of  hazardous substances 
if environmental contamination exists on our properties  we could become subject to strict  joint and several liability for the contamination by virtue of our ownership or leasehold interest 

table of contents the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs 
in addition  although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from a tenant s activities on the property  we could nonetheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest  and we cannot be sure that our tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the applicable sales agreement or lease 
the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to shareholders 
we maintain environmental insurance coverage for our property portfolio 
however  our insurance  which is limited to million per occurrence  subject to a  self insurance retention and a million cap  may be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and we may be unable to continue to obtain insurance for environmental matters  at a reasonable cost or at all  in the future 
if our environmental liability insurance is inadequate  we may become subject to material losses for environmental liabilities 
our properties may contain or develop harmful mold  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property 
in addition  the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from our tenants  employees of our tenants and others if property damage or health concerns arise 
our properties may contain asbestos which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating asbestos 
certain laws and regulations govern the removal  encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials acms when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of building renovation or demolition  impose certain worker protection and notification requirements and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air 
these laws may also impose liability for a release of acms and may enable third parties to seek recovery against us for personal injury associated with acms 
there are or may be acms at certain of our properties 
we develop and implement maintenance programs that establish operating procedures with respect to acms 

table of contents compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire  safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that adversely impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada 
the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities  but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants  or both 
while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions  and under our net leases are typically obligated to cover costs associated with compliance  if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated  if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated or if the properties at which changes are required are not leased on a net basis  we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
in addition  we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations  as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties 
we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 
an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policies on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties 
under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties  tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons  air  water  land or property  on or off the premises  due to activities conducted on the properties  except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents 
additionally  tenants are generally required  at the tenants expense  to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease  liability and property damage insurance policies issued by companies holding general policyholder ratings of at least a as set forth in the most current issue of best s insurance guide 
insurance policies for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab  foundations  supports and other customarily excluded improvements and insure against all perils of fire  extended coverage  vandalism  malicious mischief and special extended perils all risk  as that term is used in the insurance industry 
insurance policies are generally obtained by the tenant providing general liability coverage varying between million and million depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the tenant and the industry in which it operates 
these policies include liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the ownership  use  occupancy or maintenance of the properties and all of their appurtenant areas 
in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above  many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies obtained by and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs 
additionally  we have obtained blanket liability and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss 
all of these policies may involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions 
in certain areas  we may have to obtain earthquake and flood insurance on specific properties as required by our lenders or by law 
we have also obtained terrorism insurance on some of our larger office buildings  but this insurance is subject to exclusions for loss or damage caused by nuclear substances  pollutants  contaminants and biological and chemical weapons 
should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the limits for any of the policies noted above  or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy  we could lose all or part of our capital invested in  and anticipated revenue from  one or more of the properties  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all 

table of contents terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect any market on which our common shares trade  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and your investment in our common shares 
we cannot assure you that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
some of our properties are high profile office buildings in prominent locations  or are located in areas that may be susceptible to attack  which may make these properties more likely to be viewed as terrorist targets than similar  less recognizable properties 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the value of our properties through damage  destruction  loss or increased security costs 
we have obtained terrorism insurance on our large office buildings to the extent required by our lenders 
the terrorism insurance that we obtain may not be sufficient to cover loss for damages to our properties as a result of terrorist attacks 
in addition  certain losses resulting from these types of events are uninsurable and others would not be covered by our current terrorism insurance 
additional terrorism insurance may not be available at a reasonable price or at all 
any terrorist attacks or armed conflicts could result in increased volatility in or damage to the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in a continuation of economic uncertainty in the united states or abroad 
our revenues are dependent upon payment of rent by financial institutions  which are particularly vulnerable to uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets 
adverse economic conditions could affect the ability of our tenants to pay rent  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to shareholders at historical levels or at all  and may result in volatility in the market price of our securities 
tax risks of our business and structure your investment in our common shares has various federal  state and local income tax risks that could affect the value of your investment 
we strongly urge you to consult your own tax advisor concerning the effects of federal  state and local income tax law on an investment in our common shares because of the complex nature of the tax rules applicable to reits and their shareholders 
distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility in executing our business plan 
to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we generally are required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our reit taxable income each year 
reit taxable income is determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains 
we are also required to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than of our taxable income including net capital gains each year 
in addition  we are required to pay a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which certain distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income for that calendar year  of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of our income that was not distributed in prior years 
we intend to distribute to our shareholders all or substantially all of our taxable reit income each year in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code and to avoid federal income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in arriving at reit taxable income and the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

table of contents we may incur additional indebtedness in order to meet our distribution requirements 
as a reit  we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income  which limits the amount of cash we have available for other business purposes  including amounts to fund our growth 
also  it is possible that because of the differences between the time we actually receive revenue or pay expenses and the period we report those items for distribution purposes  we may have to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the distribution requirement 
our disposal of properties may have negative implications  including unfavorable tax consequences 
in the past  we have sold properties that we deemed to be inconsistent with the investment parameters for our portfolio 
we intend to continue to sell such properties 
we may also sell properties for business reasons as we deem appropriate 
if we make a sale of a property directly  and it is deemed to be a sale of dealer property or inventory  the sale may be deemed to be a prohibited transaction under federal tax laws applicable to reits  in which case our gain from the sale would be subject to a penalty tax 
if we believe that a sale of a property will likely be subject to the prohibited transaction tax  we will dispose of that property through a taxable reit subsidiary  in which case the gain from the sale would be subject to corporate income tax but not the penalty tax 
we cannot assure you  however  that the internal revenue service would not assert successfully that sales of properties that we make directly  rather than through a taxable reit subsidiary  were sales of dealer property or inventory  in which case the penalty tax would apply 
if we fail to remain qualified as a reit  our dividends will not be deductible by us  and our income will be subject to taxation 
we believe that we qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  which affords us significant tax advantages 
the requirements for this qualification  however  are complex and our management has limited experience in operating a reit 
if we fail to meet these requirements  our dividends will not be deductible by us and we will be subject to a corporate level tax on our taxable income 
this would substantially reduce our cash available to pay dividends and your yield on your investment 
in addition  incurring corporate income tax liability might cause us to borrow funds  liquidate some of our investments or take other steps which could negatively affect our operating results 
moreover  if our reit status is terminated because of our failure to meet a reit qualification requirement or if we voluntarily revoke our election  we would be disqualified from electing treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which reit status is lost 
we may be subject to federal and state income taxes that would adversely affect our financial condition 
even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit  we may become subject to federal income taxes and related state taxes 
for example  if we have net income from a sale of dealer property or inventory  that income will be subject to a penalty tax 
in addition  we may not be able to pay sufficient distributions to avoid corporate income tax and the excise tax on undistributed income 
we may also be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property  either directly  at the level of our operating partnership or at the level of the other entities through which we indirectly own our properties  that would adversely affect our operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to satisfy the reit requirements  or that it will be in our best interests to continue to do so 

table of contents we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our common shares 
the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time 
any of those new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect us or you as a shareholder 
on may   president bush signed into law a tax bill that reduced the tax rate on both dividends and long term capital gains for most non corporate taxpayers to until this reduced tax rate generally does not apply to ordinary reit dividends  which will continue to be taxed at the higher tax rates applicable to ordinary income 
this legislation could cause shares in non reit corporations to be a more attractive investment to individual investors than they had been  and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares
