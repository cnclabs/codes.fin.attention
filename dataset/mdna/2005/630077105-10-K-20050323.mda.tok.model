our business we offer a complete line of systems to address the metrology requirements of our customers 
our metrology systems can be categorized as follows standalone  fully automated systems for high volume manufacturing operations  integrated systems for integration into semiconductor processing equipment that provide real time measurements and feedback to improve process control and increase throughput  and 
table of contents tabletop systems used to provide manual or semi automatic measurements for engineering and low volume production environments 
we also provide systems that are used to measure the overlay accuracy of successive layers of semiconductor patterns on wafers in the photolithography process 
the accurate alignment  or overlay  of successive film layers  relative to each other  across the wafer is critical for device performance and favorable production yields 
we believe that process control metrology is growing at a greater rate than other segments of the semiconductor equipment market 
as films become thinner  film materials more exotic  and circuit dimensions and overlay requirements more demanding  metrology and inspection continue to grow in importance  especially as wafers become larger and more expensive to manufacture 
we expect these factors will drive the demand for our high end  standalone metrology and integrated products 
additional demands on process tool manufacturers for better film uniformity  tighter dimensional control  tool to tool matching and within tool chamber uniformity is driving the need for integrated process control metrology 
these new tool requirements will drive the need to place metrology inside the process tool for real time  integrated  process control metrology  using both feed forward and feedback of the collected metrology data to control the process equipment 
we have made several strategic changes in our business model to enable us to further address these metrology trends 
these changes include the separation of our business in japan into two facilities to better serve the semiconductor and flat panel display fpd metrology markets 
the building of our position as a leading supplier of integrated metrology systems  the introduction of several new millimeter wafer platforms for both advanced standalone and integrated metrology  the continued outsourcing of certain system components  such as robotics  enabling us to leverage our technical resources  the maximum utilization of an in house manufacturing strategy for our products  and the development of new measurement technologies for advanced lithography and ultra thin film deposition 
demand for our products is driven by the increasing use of multiple thin film technology by manufacturers of electronic products and  more recently  by the increased adoption of both integrated metrology and advanced process control apc by semiconductor manufacturers 
with feature sizes shrinking below nanometers  well below the wavelength of light  the need for very tight process tolerances as well as productivity improvements in semiconductor fabrication  or fabs  are driving the need for integrated metrology and apc 
our innovative optical critical dimension ocd measurement system is being increasingly viewed not only as an enabling technology for apc  but also as a solution for critical dimension measurement 
we combined our deep ultraviolet duv reflectometry technology with the ocd technology in a single  integrated metrology module  the nanoocd duv the compact size and speed of this ocd duv technology enables the measurement system to be fully integrated into the customer s process tool  thus providing a complete  feed forward and feedback apc solution for wafer to wafer closed loop control 
by measuring the critical dimensions of developed photoresist and then adjusting the final etched dimensions of a silicon gate etch process by feeding this information back into the process and trimming the resist  the device manufacturer is able to achieve the maximum possible microprocessor speed 
in addition  new semiconductor process technologies  such as copper interconnects  require that new measurement technologies be developed in 
table of contents order to keep pace with the latest metrology demands 
our new  combined integrated metrology module represents a unique solution to the problem of measuring the remaining oxide film thickness as well as the loss of material over arrays of copper lines during the chemical mechanical planarization cmp process 
our ocd technology has also proven to be applicable to the emerging requirements for advanced lithography measurements such as the characterization of critical dimensions and film thicknesses on masks and reticles which are comprised of square glass substrates 
we introduced the nanometrics atlas m  the first fully automated  standalone metrology system to use ocd technology for these square glass substrates 
this system is crucial to the suppliers of masks and reticles by providing the means for accurately determining line widths and analyzing complex profiles for a variety of structures found in today s mask fabrication process 
we successfully beta tested the nanometrics orion overlay control system at a leading semiconductor memory device manufacturer 
the orion is an advanced overlay metrology and analysis system for monitoring microlithography stepper performance 
orion provides exceptional throughput and measurement performance required by today s demanding mm and mm overlay control applications 
we have continued the development the universal defect inspection udi system following the successful beta site testing at a leading integrated device manufacturer idm 
the nanoudi technology can be configured as either a standalone  fully automated millimeter system or an integrated module for defect and contamination detection on a wide variety of films and surfaces 
the system combines high efficiency illumination and high resolution optics with sophisticated image processing to detect and classify particles and defects in the sub micron range 
many types of thin films are used in the manufacture of products  such as semiconductor integrated circuits and flat panel displays 
these products require the precise electronic  optical and surface properties enabled by thin film metrology 
the need for tighter process control and improved productivity has created increased demand for our advanced standalone and integrated metrology systems 
industry characteristics growth moore s law which  simply stated  predicts a doubling of integrated circuit performance with a reduction in manufacturing costs every months  is an important factor in determining factory investment in the semiconductor industry 
two important industry drivers are i the increasing complexity of chip designs as users of semiconductor chips demand increasingly higher performance and require more complicated manufacturing processes and ii the market pressure for lower cost chips 
the semiconductor equipment industry has experienced cyclical growth with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately over the past years 
the semiconductor industry recently emerged from an exceptionally long  cyclical downturn  and saw a growth in semiconductor equipment revenues of approximately over we believe that the convergence of millimeter wafer size  copper interconnects and fast  sub nanometer architecture will continue to drive the demand for new metrology solutions  such as those that we offer  and that the process control market segment will continue to outpace overall equipment growth 
in the past  demand for internet access  personal computers  telecommunications  and new consumer electronic products and services has fueled growth of the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display industries 
new display technologies  consumer electronics  automotive electronics and personal computers will likely continue as the primary drivers in the near term for the semiconductor industry 
we believe that consumer desire for high performance electronics drives technology advancement in semiconductor design and manufacturing and  in turn  promotes the purchasing of capital equipment featuring the latest advances in technology 

table of contents the two significant factors affecting demand for our measurement systems are i new construction or refurbishment of manufacturing facilities  which  in turn  depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors  disk drives  flat panel displays  and products that use such components  and ii the increasing complexity of the manufacturing process as a result of the demand for higher performance semiconductors and flat panel displays 
semiconductor manufacturing process semiconductors are fabricated by a series of process steps on a wafer substrate made of silicon or other material 
our thin film  critical dimension  overlay metrology and defect inspection systems can be used at many points during the fabrication process to monitor and measure circuit dimensions  layer to layer registration and film uniformity as well as material properties in order to maximize the yield of acceptable semiconductors 
each wafer typically goes through a series of to process and metrology steps in generally repetitive cycles 
the four primary wafer film processing steps are deposition  chemical mechanical planarization  photolithography imaging and overlay  and etching of circuit elements 
deposition 
deposition refers to placing layers of insulating or conducting materials on a wafer surface in thin films that make up the circuit elements of semiconductor devices 
common methods of deposition include chemical vapor deposition cvd  plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition pecvd and physical vapor deposition pvd 
diffusion and oxidation are also used to create or define thin films 
the control of uniformity and thickness during the formation of these films is critical to the performance of the semiconductor circuit 
chemical mechanical planarization 
cmp flattens  or planarizes  the topography of the film surface to permit the multiple patterns of small features on the resulting smoothed surface by the photolithography process 
the cmp process is a combination of chemical etching and mechanical polishing and commonly uses an abrasive liquid and polishing pad 
semiconductor manufacturers need metrology systems to control the cmp process by measuring the thin film layer to determine precisely when the appropriate thickness has been achieved 
photolithography 
photolithography is the process step that projects the patterns of the circuits on the chip 
a wafer is pre coated with photoresist  a light sensitive film  that must have an accurate thickness and uniformity for exposure 
photolithography involves the optical projection of integrated circuit patterns onto the photoresist after which  the photoresist is developed  leaving unexposed areas available for etching 
in order to precisely control the photolithography process  it is necessary to verify reflectivity  film thickness  critical dimensions and overlay registration 
etch 
etch is a dry or wet process for selectively removing unwanted areas that have been deposited on the surface of a wafer 
a film of developed photoresist protects material that needs to be left untouched by the etch to make up the circuits 
thin film metrology systems are required to verify precision of material removal and critical dimension achievement 
before and after deposition  cmp  photolithography and etch  the wafer surface is measured to determine the quality of the film or pattern and to find defects 
measurements taken to ensure process uniformity include thickness  width  height  roughness and other characteristics 
process control helps avoid costly rework or misprocessing and results in higher yields for semiconductor manufacturers 

table of contents these processing steps are typically repeated multiple times during the fabrication process  with alternating layers of insulating and conducting films 
depending on the specific design of a given integrated circuit  a variety of film types and thicknesses and a number of layers can be used to achieve desired electronic performance characteristics 
the semiconductors are then tested  separated into individual circuits  assembled and packaged into an integrated circuit 
flat panel display manufacturing processes flat panel displays are manufactured in clean rooms using thin film measurement systems that are similar to those used in semiconductor manufacturing 
most flat panel displays are constructed on large glass substrates that currently range in size up to  x  millimeters and should increase to up to  x  millimeters by the end of increased use of metrology in manufacturing we believe that continually rising wafer costs are forcing semiconductor manufacturers to re evaluate their manufacturing strategies at all levels  from individual process steps to fabwide process optimization 
many major semiconductor manufacturers are adopting feed forward and feedback of film thickness and critical dimensions  or cds  based on real time data from metrology systems 
major benefits of these new metrology strategies are higher manufacturing efficiencies from reduced rework  reduced headcount to perform at the same quality level and increased device performance 
additional benefits include process tool matching and more precise control of the overall manufacturing process 
drive toward integrated metrology for many years  semiconductor manufacturers have sought to improve fab efficiency by choosing systems that integrate more than one process step into a single tool 
integrated metrology solutions increase productivity with higher throughput  smaller overall product footprints  reduced wafer handling and faster process development 
this trend began in the mid s  as leading manufacturers introduced a cluster process tool architecture that combined multiple processes in separate chambers around a central wafer handling platform 
today  although there is continued focus on increased productivity driving the adoption of integrated metrology  there is an additional requirement for tighter process tolerances with advanced  sub nm technologies 
this new requirement is driving integrated process control metrology as necessary for many processes  such as planarization  deposition  lithography and etch 
as a result  we continue to see the emergence of integrated metrology using both feed forward and feedback process tool control in real time 
integrated metrology has already shown its ability to control key process parameters during the manufacturing process 
additional benefits include extended tool availability and improved utilization 
tighter control of the process means lower material and processing costs 
integrated metrology also provides rapid fault detection  improved excursion control and loss prevention  which can be elusive with only open loop standalone metrology 
before we introduced integrated metrology  semiconductor manufacturers were required to physically transport wafers from a process tool to a separate metrology system in order to make critical measurements such as film thickness and uniformity 
manufacturers of process equipment are increasingly seeking to offer their customers integrated metrology in their tools to lower costs and improve overall fab efficiency 
integrated metrology provides semiconductor manufacturers with several additional benefits  including a reduction in the number of test wafers  increased overall process throughput  faster detection of process excursions and faults  reduced wafer handling  faster process development and ultimately an improvement in overall equipment effectiveness

spectroscopic reflectometry 
we pioneered the use of micro spot spectroscopic reflectometry for semiconductor film metrology in the late s 
spectroscopic reflectometry uses multiple wavelengths colors of light to obtain an array of data for analysis of film thickness and other film parameters 
today s semiconductor manufacturers still depend on spectroscopic reflectometry for most film metrology applications 
reflectometry is the measurement of reflected light 
for film metrology  a wavelength spectrum in the visible region is commonly used 
light reflected from the surfaces of the film and the substrate is analyzed using computers and measurement algorithms 
the analysis yields thickness information and other parameters without contacting or destroying the film 
in the mid s  we introduced a duv reflectometer for material analysis 
in  we were awarded a patent for the determination of absolute reflectance in the ultraviolet region 
this technology provides enhanced measurement performance for thinner films and for films stacked on top of one another 
spectroscopic ellipsometry 
like reflectometry  ellipsometry is a non contact and non destructive technique used to analyze and measure films 
an ellipsometer analyzes the change in a polarized beam of light after reflection from a film s surface and interface 
our systems are spectroscopic  providing ellipsometric data at many different wavelengths 
spectroscopic ellipsometry provides a wealth of information about a film  yielding very accurate and reliable measurements 
in general  ellipsometers are used for thin films and complex film stacks  whereas reflectometers are used for thicker films and stacks 
optical critical dimension technology 
our ocd technology is a critical dimension measurement technology that is used to precisely determine the dimensions on the semiconductor wafer that directly control the resulting performance of the integrated circuit devices 
our non destructive  ocd measurement technology is compatible with the current nm manufacturing technology and can be extended below nm for future requirements in both photo lithography and etch applications 
ocd combines non contact optical technology with extremely powerful data analysis software to provide highly accurate measurement results for line width  height and sidewall angles 
this technology is available in both standalone and integrated platforms 
overlay registration 
overlay registration refers to the relative alignment of two layers in the thin film photolithographic process 
our microscope based  measurement technology utilizes a high magnification  low distortion imaging system combined with proprietary software algorithms to numerically quantify the alignment 

table of contents diffraction based overlay registration 
we developed diffraction based overlay as an alternative solution for overlay technology nodes below nanometers 
this novel technique extracts overlay alignment error from our broadband ocd technology using specially designed diffraction targets in real time 
the technique is based on spectroscopy rather than imaging  is much more robust than aerial imaging methods  and the total measurement uncertainty is about six times smaller than traditional techniques 
this new technology is capable of meeting the advanced design requirements of the nm process 
a major advantage of the diffraction technique is that the measurement targets can be produced that match the dimensions of the circuits being manufactured  thus providing the immediate benefit of looking at the overlay performance of features that closely resemble the circuit features 
optical profilometry 
we developed the optical profiler for the measurement of copper metal loss during the chemical mechanical planarization process 
this technology uses the combination of an optical interferometer and our reflectometer technology to accurately determine metal loss  even over multiple layers during the final steps of metallization 
our technology is a unique method for precisely and accurately controlling this semiconductor manufacturing process step 
extreme dark field edf imaging technology 
our new  dark field inspection technology is used to detect and accurately locate particles and defects on the front and back sides of wafer surfaces  which could potentially lead to device failures and critical yield loss during the semiconductor manufacturing process 
the technology combines a high efficiency  broadband light source with a high resolution detection system and proprietary digital image processing for defect and contamination detection on a wide variety of films and surfaces 
we believe that this technology can be readily extended to other manufacturing processes

overview we are an innovator in the field of metrology systems for the semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing industries 
our systems are designed to precisely monitor film thickness and critical dimensions that are necessary to control the manufacturing process and provide increased production yields and performance 
capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors and flat panel displays  especially in asia  and their suppliers are critical to our success 
the demand by these manufacturers and suppliers is driven by the expected market demand for new products and new applications 
the increasing complexity of the mm manufacturing processes for semiconductors and larger flat panel displays is an important factor in the demand for our innovative metrology systems 
the incorporation of smaller features sizes  copper interconnect technology and optical critical dimension technology are expected to result in increased demand 
our strategy is to continue to innovate organically as well to evaluate strategic acquisitions in order to address business challenges and opportunities 
our revenues are derived from product sales and customer service  which include sales of accessories and service for the installed base of our products 
for the year ended january   we derived of our total net revenues from product sales and of our total net revenues from services 

table of contents important themes and significant trends the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by cyclical growth 
recently  the industry emerged from an exceptionally long  cyclical downturn 
changing trends in the semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing industries are increasing the need for metrology as a major component of manufacturing systems 
these trends include conversion to mm wafer size 
semiconductor manufacturers are converting to mm wafers to achieve better production efficiencies 
most facilities are incorporating this wafer size  and our newest products are well positioned to serve these facilities 
it is important that we are successful in product evaluations with these new mm facilities in order to continue to gain market share 
incorporation of optical critical dimension metrology in the patterning process 
our customers use phototlithographic processes to create patterns on wafers 
critical dimensions must be carefully controlled during this process 
our proprietary optical critical dimension systems can provide the critical process control of these circuit dimensions that is necessary for successful manufacturing of these state of the art devices 
copper interconnect technology 
the need for ever increasing device circuit speed coupled with lower power consumption has pushed semiconductor device manufacturers to begin the replacement of the subtractive aluminum interconnect process with copper damascene technology 
this new copper processing technology has driven the need for new metrology techniques such as non destructive laser profiling and the use of optical critical dimension ocd technology for control of the copper process 
incorporation of nm and nm feature sizes 
in an effort to reduce costs and increase device performance  semiconductor manufacturers are decreasing both the dye size and feature size 
monitoring the increased tolerance requirements on smaller features sizes requires increased use of metrology systems 
our thin film and critical dimension metrology systems are well suited and are being adopted for these next generation processes 
reduced number of customers 
because of the escalating cost of mm manufacturing facilities  fewer semiconductor manufacturers can afford the significant investment in these next generation facilities 
therefore  fewer opportunities for semiconductors equipment companies exist 
given that the available number of potential customers is decreasing  previous customer relationships  product positioning and critical mass take on greater importance 
adoption of new types of thin film materials 
manufacturers are adopting new processes and technologies that increase the importance and utilization of thin film metrology systems 
to achieve greater semiconductor device speed  manufacturers are utilizing copper and new  low dielectric constant low k insulating materials 
our advanced metrology solutions are required in the manufacturing process to characterize these materials 
need for improved process control to drive process efficiencies 
competitive forces influencing semiconductor device manufacturers  such as price cutting and shorter product life cycles  place pressure on manufacturers to rapidly achieve production efficiency 
device manufacturers are using our integrated and standalone metrology systems throughout the fab to ensure that manufacturing processes scale rapidly  are accurate and can be repeated on a consistent basis 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements conforms with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and judgments in applying our accounting policies that have an important impact on our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  warranty obligations and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 

table of contents actual results may differ from management s estimates 
we believe that the application of the following accounting policies requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition nanometrics recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue includes hardware and software that is incidental to the products 
for product sales to existing customers  revenue recognition generally occurs at the time of shipment  as our terms are fob shipping point  if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment 
all other product revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
in japan  where risk of loss and title transfers to the customer upon customer acceptance  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance 
all of our products are assembled prior to shipment to our customers 
we often perform limited installation for our customers  however such installation is inconsequential and perfunctory as it is also performed by third parties 
revenue related to spare parts sales is recognized on shipment and is included as part of service revenue 
service revenue also includes service contracts and non warranty repairs of systems 
whereas service revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the period under contract  service revenue related to repairs of systems is recognized as services are performed 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in deferred revenue 
furthermore  we do not provide our customers with any return rights 
service contracts may be purchased by the customer when the warranty period expires 
in limited situations we have multiple deliverables in our customer arrangements 
those situations include the sale of repair services and parts together where revenues are recognized when both the services and parts have been delivered 
we also provide technical support to our customers as part of our warranty program 
upon recognition of product revenue  a liability is recorded for anticipated warranty costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of our customers 
where appropriate and available  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due  customary payment practices in the respective geographies and our historical collection experience with customers 
we believe that our doubtful accounts allowance reflects our risk associated with smaller rather than larger customers and that our reported allowances are adequate 
if however  the financial conditions of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances which would result in additional general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventories we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our market  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
we have established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales of usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
for demonstration inventory  we also consider the potential cost to refurbish the inventory prior to sale 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those 
table of contents that we project  additional reserves may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market value 
product warranties nanometrics sells the majority of its products with a twelve month repair or replacement warranty from the date of shipment 
the company provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to revenues 
the estimated future warranty obligations related to product sales are reported in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
the estimated future warranty obligations are affected by sales volumes  product failure rates  material usage and replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or replacement costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligations would be required 
for new product introductions where limited or no historical information exists  the company may use warranty information from other previous product introductions to guide it in estimating its warranty accrual 
the warranty accrual represents the best estimate of the amount necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty reserve and adjusts the amounts in accordance with changes in these factors 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes based on statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax accounting for assets and liabilities 
also  deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate 
factors used in this determination include future expected income and the underlying asset or liability which generated the temporary tax difference 
our income tax provision is primarily impacted by federal statutory rates  state and foreign income taxes and changes in our valuation allowance 
stock based compensation we currently account for stock based compensation issued to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures  an amendment of fasb statement no 
under the intrinsic value method  we do not recognize any compensation expense  as the exercise price of all stock options is equal to the fair market value at the time the options are granted 
we disclose the pro forma effect of recognizing compensation expense on stock options granted to employees in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
these pro forma effects are based on the fair value of the options using the black scholes valuation model using assumptions which are based on our historical experience 
our accounting treatment of stock options will significantly change during due to our planned adoption of sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which is effective for periods beginning after june  see recent accounting pronouncements

table of contents years ended december   january  and january  total net revenues 
our net revenues were comprised of the following categories years ended january  january  percentage change automated systems integrated systems tabletop systems service total net revenues years ended december  january  percentage change automated systems integrated systems tabletop systems service total net revenues in  revenue from automated systems increased by and integrated system revenue increased by from their levels  primarily due to higher volume sales for each product group 
the higher volume sales for each product group is primarily due to our new mm products  such as the atlas automated metrology product and integrated metrology system 
the increase in product revenue resulted from greater demand for semiconductor process control metrology equipment and flat panel display equipment  particularly in the us and asia 
we believe that this increased demand was attributable primarily to customers adding capacity in semiconductor production facilities as demand for semiconductors increased as a result of the continuing economic recoveries in the us and japan in service revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in service revenue is primarily attributable to higher sales of parts and services in the us and asia in  which we believe is due to a growing installed base of systems that have passed their warranty periods 
the strengthening of the japanese yen accounted for approximately of total net revenues in total net revenues increased from million in to million in product revenue increased from million in to million in unit sales of existing automated and integrated systems increased from their levels 
additionally  our new products  such as the nanoocd integrated product also contributed to our revenues 
the increase in product revenue resulted from greater demand for semiconductor process control metrology equipment and flat panel display equipment  particularly in asia 
we believe that this increased demand was attributable primarily to customers adding capacity in semiconductor production facilities as demand for semiconductors increased as a result of the economic recoveries in the us and japan in service revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales of parts and services in the us and asia in  which we believe was due in part to increased demand for semiconductors at a time when capital expenditures by equipment manufacturers had been reduced  resulting in increased utilization of older systems by customers 
although fiscal included weeks  the length of this accounting period did not materially impact our comparative sales trends 
cost of products 
cost of products as a percentage of product revenue decreased from in to in due primarily to increased product sales volume in resulting in lower per unit manufacturing costs 
the lower product revenue in was partially offset by a write down of approximately  in 
table of contents slower moving inventory in based on our estimate that future forecasted sales for certain product lines had permanently declined 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased from in to in due in part to lower sales prices on older products and higher costs associated with an increase in manufacturing capacity added to our us facility 
the increased manufacturing capacity is part of a continuing strategic plan to internalize the production of key parts and components  allowing us to have greater control over their development  delivery  quality and cost 
the warranty accrual at january  was  an increase of compared to the same period in this increase resulted primarily from increased sales volume and the associated warranty costs 
cost of service 
cost of service as a percentage of service revenue increased from in to in primarily as a result of higher service costs from an increase in headcount and related overhead to provide additional support for our growing customer base  particularly in asia 
we could not fully recoup these costs due to higher service demands from our customer base 
cost of service as a percentage of service revenue decreased from in to in primarily as a result of higher service sales that exceeded the increase in the associated variable cost of service sales in while fixed costs at the time remained relatively stable 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in primarily from lower materials expenses in resulting from cost cutting measures in the first half of the year 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in as a result of lower expenses associated with lower usage of materials used in the development of new products in in the united states  our research and development efforts are focused on semiconductor metrology 
in south korea  our research and development efforts are focused on the overlay metrology market 
in japan  our research and development efforts are focused on tabletop and flat panel display metrology 
we are committed to the development of new and enhanced products and believe that new product introductions are required for us to maintain our competitive position 
we expect research and development expenses to remain at current levels for the immediate future 
selling 
while selling expenses were relatively flat at million in compared to million in  sales commissions in increased by about over levels as a result of higher sales volume in this increase in was partially offset by the redeployment of some resources into service support  which resulted in a decrease of about of our selling expenses in japan 
selling expenses increased from million in to million in primarily due to increased headcount of sales and support employees and related expenses particularly in asia in an effort to fully participate in the growth opportunities in that region 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in due in part to higher regulatory expenses 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the immediate future due to regulatory requirements 
in addition  salary expenses were lower in resulting from shutdown days taken during that time as a cost cutting measure 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease resulted primarily from lower accounting software implementation costs in goodwill impairment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon implementation of this statement  the transition impairment test was performed as of january   and no impairment loss was recorded 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
we elected to test our goodwill for possible impairment in the fourth quarter of based upon the results of the annual impairment test  we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of  representing the full value of goodwill 
the fair value of the segment was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 

table of contents total other income  net 
total other income  net  which primarily consists of interest income  interest expense and foreign currency transaction gains losses  decreased from  in to  in primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses as well as lower interest income in provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was an expense of in the tax expense in was primarily a result of foreign income taxes as the federal statutory income taxes were offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate was an expense of in  versus a benefit of in the tax expense in resulted from a provision for income taxes of approximately million which primarily represents a charge to record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets 
the charge was taken as a result of pretax losses incurred over the past several quarters coupled with uncertainty about future expected income in the then existing market environment  making it more likely than not at that time that the deferred tax asset would not be realized 
in the future  we will continue to review our expectations for future taxable income to determine the amount of valuation allowance necessary to reserve against deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources at january   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million compared to million at january  the short term investments consist of us treasury bills 
our working capital of million at january  increased from million at january operating activities provided net cash of million in this source of cash in resulted primarily from net income and non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and higher levels of current liabilities 
these sources of cash were offset to a large extent by higher accounts receivable resulting from our revenue increase of in the increase in accounts receivable was due to the higher concentration of revenue in the third and fourth quarters of we would expect this trend in operating cash flow and working capital to continue 
operating activities used million in and million in the cash usage in and resulted primarily from the net loss in those years offset by the effect of non cash expenses 
we also experienced higher levels of accounts receivable in resulting from increased sales towards the end of investing activities provided net cash of million in  provided million of cash in and used million of cash in the timing of the purchase and initial maturities of us treasury bills in resulted in their classification as cash and cash equivalents instead of as short term investments 
our capital expenditures were  in   in and million in these expenditures were used primarily to continue the process of internalizing our manufacturing capacity in the united states through  for example  the purchase of a machine shop  machining equipment and improvements to our building 
this internalization process was completed in the first quarter of and as a result we expect capital expenditures to decrease in the immediate future 
financing activities provided net cash of million in   of cash in and  in primarily resulting from the sale of shares under our stock option plans  offset to some extent by the net repayment of debt obligations by our japanese subsidiary 
we have evaluated and will continue to evaluate the acquisition of products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our business 
these activities may result in product and business investments  which may affect our cash position and working capital balances 
some of these activities might require significant cash outlays 
however  we believe that our working capital  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet our needs at least through the next twelve months 
due to the cyclical nature of our business  we may seek outside financing opportunistically in the future 
we believe our existing working capital  together with expected cash flows from operations and available sources of 
table of contents bank  equity and equipment financing  will be sufficient to support our operations in the future 
on january   we entered into a definitive merger agreement with august technology corporation 
if the merger is consummated  it may result in cash outflows related to integration activities 
estimates of these outflows are not currently known 
management of nanometrics and august technology are in the process of making these assessments 
notwithstanding the cash outflows that may result from integrating the two companies  we believe the merger  if consummated  may enhance the company s liquidity and capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating leases other long term liabilities our debt obligations primarily relate to the expansion of our japanese facilities to accommodate the production of larger flat panel display systems  and do not include interest  which we are obligated to pay 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas r requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the pro forma disclosure previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an acceptable alternative to recognition of expenses in the financial statements 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first reporting period that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
we currently measure compensation costs related to share based payments under apb  as allowed by sfas  and provide disclosure in notes to financial statements as required by sfas we are required to adopt sfas r starting in the third fiscal quarter of we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our net income and net income per share

we are following the disclosure requirements of this eitf 
factors that may affect future operating results you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business cyclicality in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries has led to substantial fluctuations in demand for our systems and may  from time to time  continue to do so 
our operating results have varied significantly from period to period due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and flat panel display industries 
the majority of our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device and equipment manufacturers 
these manufacturers capital expenditures  in turn  depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
these downturns have often resulted in substantial decreases in the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  including metrology systems 
we have found that the resulting decrease in capital expenditures has typically been more pronounced than the downturn in semiconductor device industry revenues 
we expect the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  and therefore  our business  to continue in the foreseeable future 
recently  the semiconductor industry emerged from a sustained downturn  which had existed for the past few years 
should this trend reverse and the downturn resume  our business and results of operations would suffer 
because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales in asia  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by the instability of asian economies 
revenues from customers in asian markets represented approximately  and of our total net revenues in  and  respectively 
countries in the asia pacific region  including japan  south korea and taiwan  each of which accounted for a significant portion of our business in that region  had experienced general economic weaknesses in and  which adversely affected our revenues at that time 

table of contents we depend on applied materials and other oem suppliers for sales of our integrated metrology systems  and the loss of applied materials or any of our other oem suppliers as a customer could harm our business 
we believe that sales of integrated metrology systems will continue to be an important source of our revenues 
sales of our integrated metrology systems depend upon the ability of applied materials to sell semiconductor equipment products that include our metrology systems as components 
if applied materials is unable to sell such products  or if applied materials chooses to focus its attention on products that do not integrate our systems  our business could suffer 
if we were to lose applied materials as a customer for any reason  our ability to realize sales from integrated metrology systems would be significantly diminished  which would harm our business 
our largest customers account for a substantial portion of our revenue  and our revenue would materially decline if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or if they delayed or cancelled a large order 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and each year has been derived from sales to a relatively few number of customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
there are only a limited number of large companies operating in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries 
accordingly  we expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues for at least the next several years 
if any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer systems  or if a large order were delayed or cancelled  our revenues would significantly decline 
in  sales to applied materials accounted for and sales to samsung accounted for of our total net revenues  respectively 
in  sales to applied materials accounted for and sales to hynix accounted for of our total net revenues  respectively 
in  sales to applied materials accounted for and sales to tsmc accounted for of our total net revenues  respectively 
the success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers 
in order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner  we must continue to collaborate closely with our customers 
our relationships with our customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding industry trends  which enables us to better plan our product development activities 
if our current relationships with our large customers are impaired  or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future  our long term ability to produce commercially successful systems could be adversely affected 
we may have difficulty meeting the requirements described in section of the sarbanes oxley act of  including addressing certain significant deficiencies in our internal controls identified in connection with our fiscal year end audit  and failure to meet such requirements could materially affect our stock price 
we may be required to file a report on internal accounting controls  in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  with our annual report on form k for the year ending december  accordingly  we would be required to increase the amount of documentation surrounding our internal control systems and provide evidence that our systems have been properly tested to support our management s conclusions 
while we continue to improve our internal control systems  including through the companywide implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system or erp system  there can be no assurance that our report will not disclose a material weakness 
even if we do not identify such a material weakness  our auditors may identify a material weakness in their attestation 
in the event that a material weakness is identified  our stock price may be adversely affected 

table of contents in connection with the audit conducted by the independent registered public accounting firm bdo seidman  llp bdo seidman of our consolidated financial statements  bdo seidman advised our management and our audit committee of certain significant deficiencies in our internal controls and made certain recommendations 
under the auditing standards of the pcaob  a significant deficiency represents a deficiency in the design or operation of internal controls in which there is a more than remote likelihood that a misstatement that is more than inconsequential but less than material could occur 
please refer to item a  management report on internal control over financial reporting  for details 
we are currently in the process of implementing the recommendations of bdo seidman 
additionally  we are also in the process of augmenting our current control processes  repositioning current finance and accounting personnel and recruiting additional personnel to ensure consistently complete and accurate reporting of financial information 
we believe we will satisfactorily address most of the significant deficiencies referenced above by the end of the third fiscal quarter of  although there can be no assurance that we will do so  as the proposed merger with august technology will require significant integration efforts by management 
furthermore  remediation of the company s internal controls  required to fully comply with the section internal control assessment  may require more significant efforts by management than initially anticipated 
our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  and increased competition could impair sales of our products 
we operate in the highly competitive semiconductor and flat panel display industries and face competition from a number of companies  many of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer support resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products  which could impair sales of our products 
moreover  there has been merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors 
these transactions by our competitors and potential competitors may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs 
many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries are large companies that require global support and service for their metrology systems 
some of our larger or more geographically diverse competitors might be better equipped to provide this global support 
if any of our systems fail to meet or exceed our internal quality specifications  we cannot ship them until such time as they have met such specifications 
if we experience significant delays or are unable to ship our products to our customers as a result of our internal processes  or for any other reason  our business and reputation may suffer 
our products are complex and require technical expertise to design and manufacture properly 
various problems occasionally arise during the manufacturing process that may cause delays and or impair product quality 
we must actively monitor our manufacturing processes to ensure that our products meet our internal quality specifications 
any significant delays stemming from the failure of our products to meet or exceed our internal quality specifications  or for any other reasons  would delay our shipments 
shipment delays could harm our business and reputation in the industry 
if we deliver systems with defects  our credibility will be harmed  revenue from  and market acceptance of  our systems will decrease and we could expend significant capital and resources as a result of such defects 
notwithstanding our internal quality specifications  our systems have sometimes contained errors  defects and bugs when introduced 
if we deliver systems with errors  defects or bugs  our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems would be harmed 
further  if our systems contain errors  defects or bugs  we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems 
defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers 
we have agreed to 
table of contents indemnify our customers in some circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems 
in the event of a successful product liability claim  we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits 
successful infringement claims by third parties could result in substantial damages  lost product sales and the loss of important intellectual property rights by us 
our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties 
from time to time we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our metrology systems may contain design features which are claimed to infringe on their proprietary rights 
for example  we announced on march  that we had received notice of a patent infringement lawsuit brought by nova measuring instruments  ltd  alleging infringement of united states patent no 
 or the patent 
there can be no assurance that nanometrics new or current products do not infringe any valid intellectual property rights 
even if our products do not infringe  we may be required to expend significant sums of money to defend against infringement claims  as in the nova measuring instruments  ltd 
lawsuit described above  or to actively protect our intellectual property rights through litigation 
we obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and significant loss of revenue 
we rely on outside vendors to manufacture many components and subassemblies 
certain components  subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our systems are obtained from a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers 
we do not maintain any long term supply agreements with any of our suppliers 
we have entered into arrangements with ja woollam company for the purchase of the spectroscopic ellipsometer component incorporated in our advanced measurement systems 
our reliance on a sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including the following we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components  we have reduced control over pricing and the timely delivery of components and subassemblies  and our suppliers may be unable to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new systems 
some of our suppliers have relatively limited financial and other resources 
because the manufacturing of certain of these components and subassemblies involves extremely complex processes and requires long lead times  we may experience delays or shortages caused by our suppliers 
if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components or subassemblies internally  we could be forced to redesign our systems  which could cause production delays and prevent us from shipping our systems to customers on a timely basis 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries from our suppliers  or any other circumstance that would restrict our ability to ship our products  could damage relationships with current and prospective customers  harm our business and result in significant loss of revenue 
variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results  which could adversely affect our stock price 
variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues to fluctuate widely from period to period 
our customers generally take long periods of time to evaluate our metrology systems 
we expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems 
the length of time that it takes for us to complete a sale depends upon many factors  including the efforts of our sales force and our independent sales representatives  the complexity of the customer s metrology needs  
table of contents the internal technical capabilities and sophistication of the customer  the customer s budgetary constraints  and the quality and sophistication of the customer s current processing equipment 
because of the number of factors influencing the sales process  the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time at which we recognize revenue from that customer  if at all  varies widely 
our sales cycles  including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order  typically range from three to six months 
occasionally our sales cycles can be much longer  particularly with customers in asia who may require longer evaluation periods 
during the sales cycles  we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue  and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts 
if we do complete a sale  customers often purchase only one of our systems and then evaluate its performance for a lengthy period of time before purchasing additional systems 
the purchases are generally made through purchase orders rather than through long term contracts 
the number of additional products that a customer purchases  if any  depends on many factors  including a customer s capacity requirements 
the period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases is unpredictable and can vary from three months to a year or longer 
variations in the length of this period could cause fluctuations in our operating results  which could adversely affect our stock price 
relatively small fluctuations in our system sales volume may cause our operating results to vary significantly each quarter 
during any quarter  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our automated metrology systems range in price from approximately  to over  per system  our integrated metrology systems range in price from approximately  to  per system and our tabletop metrology systems range in price from approximately  to  per system 
accordingly  a small change in the number or types of systems that we sell could cause significant changes in our operating results 
we may experience material payment delays as a result of customer acceptance issues and such delays could negatively affect our results of operations 
as a result of customer acceptance issues  we may  from time to time  experience payment delays on some of our systems 
because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of a relatively small number of our systems  substantial payment delays by our customers could materially and adverse affect our results of operations 
we depend on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter  and therefore our results of operations may be subject to significant variability from quarter to quarter 
our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter and shipments from backlog 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not include all systems sales needed to achieve expected revenues for that quarter 
consequently  we are dependent on obtaining orders for systems to be shipped in the same quarter that the order is received 
moreover  customers may reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
accordingly  we have limited visibility into future product shipments  and our results of operations may be subject to significant variability from quarter to quarter 

table of contents because of the high cost of switching equipment vendors in our markets  it is sometimes difficult for us to attract customers from our competitors even if our metrology systems are superior to theirs 
we believe that once a semiconductor or flat panel display customer has selected one vendor s metrology system  the customer generally relies upon that system and  to the extent possible  subsequent generations of the same vendor s system  for the life of the application 
once a vendor s metrology system has been installed  a customer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience downtime in order to switch to another vendor s metrology system 
accordingly  unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems  it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales from that customer once it has selected another vendor s system for an application 
if we are not successful in developing new and enhanced metrology systems we will likely lose market share to our competitors 
we operate in an industry that is subject to technological changes  changes in customer demands and the introduction of new  higher performance systems with short product life cycles 
to be competitive  we must continually design  develop and introduce in a timely manner new metrology systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers and suppliers 
we must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive 
we may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems  and we may not ultimately be successful in developing them 
any significant delay in releasing new systems could adversely affect our reputation  give a competitor a first to market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share 
lack of market acceptance for our new products may affect our ability to generate revenue and may harm our business 
we have recently introduced several new products to market including the nano ocd duv  the nanometrics atlas  atlas m  orion and the nano ocd m 
we have invested substantial time and resources into the development of the products 
however  we cannot accurately predict the future level of acceptance of our new products by our customers 
as a result  we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue from sales of these products 
while we anticipate that our new products will become an increasingly larger component of our business  their failure to gain acceptance with our customers could materially harm our business 
additionally  if our new products do gain market acceptance  our ability to sell our existing products may be impeded 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the introduction of these products will be commercially successful or that these products will result in significant additional revenues or improved operating margins in future periods 
our intellectual property may be infringed upon by third parties despite our efforts to protect it  which could threaten our future success and competitive position and adversely affect our operating results 
our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families  and we rely  in part  on patent  trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  it will be easier for our competitors to sell competing products 
we own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our metrology systems  and have filed applications for additional patents 
any of our pending patent applications may be rejected  and we may not in the future be able to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable 
in addition  the patents we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties 
third parties may also design around these patents 
in addition to patent protection  we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology 
we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees 
however  in the event that these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies 
our confidential and proprietary information and technology might also be independently developed by or become otherwise known 
table of contents to third parties 
we may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us  or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights 
any such litigation  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming  and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re engineer our product or obtain expensive licenses from third parties  any of which would adversely affect our business and operating results 
if we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves  we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost effective and non disruptive manner 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
to achieve this  from time to time we have acquired complementary businesses  products  or technologies instead of developing them ourselves and may choose to do so in the future 
for example  we recently announced our intent to merge with august technology  a leader in macro defect inspection 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any acquisitions  or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate them profitably or retain their key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology that we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management 
in addition  in order to finance any acquisitions  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
in that event  we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and  in the case of an equity financing  that result in dilution to our shareholders 
if we are unable to integrate any acquired entities  products or technologies effectively  our business will suffer 
our ability to integrate other businesses  including august technology  will be challenged further by our newly implemented erp system 
we must attract and retain key personnel with relevant industry knowledge to help support our future growth 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  customer support  finance and manufacturing personnel 
we generally do not enter into employment contracts with any of our key personnel 
the loss of any of these key personnel  who would be difficult to replace  could harm our business and operating results 
to support our future growth  we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
competition for such personnel in our industry is ongoing  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees 
we manufacture all of our systems at a limited number of facilities  and any prolonged disruption in the operations of those facilities could reduce our revenues 
we produce all of our systems in our manufacturing facilities located in milpitas  california and through our subsidiaries in japan and south korea 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated  costly equipment and specially designed facilities 
as a result  any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities  such as those resulting from a fire or severe earthquake  could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines 
a significant portion of our operations is located in japan and south korea  which may be subject to regional political and economic instability 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states 
in  and   and  respectively  of our total net revenues were derived from sales to customers in foreign countries  including certain countries in asia  such as taiwan  south korea and japan 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products 

table of contents continuing economic and political instability could affect our business and results of operations 
the ongoing threat of terrorism targeted at the united states or other regions where we conduct business increases the uncertainty in our markets and the economy in general 
this uncertainty is likely to result in economic stagnation  which would harm our business 
in addition  increased international political instability may hinder our ability to do business by increasing our costs of operations 
for example  our transportation costs  insurance costs and sales efforts may become more expensive as a result of geopolitical tension 
these tensions may also negatively affect our suppliers and customers 
if this international economic and political instability continues or increases  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
we will incur increased costs as a result of recent changes in laws and regulations affecting public companies 
compliance with recent changes in laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  may result in increased accounting  legal and administrative costs 
in particular  section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules of the securities and exchange commission and the public company accounting oversight board impose new requirements with respect to the evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls 
the cost of complying with these new requirements could be substantial 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and probably will continue to vary significantly in the future  which will cause volatility in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary in the future  which volatility could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include changes in customer demand for our systems  economic conditions in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries  the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders and shipments  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  competitive pressures on product prices and changes in pricing by our customers or suppliers  the timing of new product announcements and product releases by us or our competitors and our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a timely and cost effective basis  the timing of acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies  the levels of our fixed expenses  including research and development costs associated with product development  relative to our revenue levels  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the japanese yen 
if our operating results in any period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
we are highly dependent on international sales and operations  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
sales to customers in foreign countries accounted for approximately  and of our total net revenues in  and  respectively 
we maintain facilities in japan and south korea 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
international sales and operations carry inherent risks such as regulatory limitations imposed by foreign governments  
table of contents obstacles to the protection of our intellectual property  political  military and terrorism risks  disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs brokers or other government agencies  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from changes in tax laws 
if any of these risks materialize and we are unable to manage them  our international sales and operations would suffer 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and may adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal  state  local  and international laws governing the environment  including those relating to the storage  use  discharge  disposal  labeling  and human exposure to hazardous and toxic materials 
we could incur costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims  or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs  if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 
liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault 
compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire additional expensive equipment  modify our manufacturing processes  or incur other significant expenses 
there can be no assurance that violations of environmental laws or regulations will not occur in the future as a result of the inability to obtain permits  human error  equipment failure or other causes 
risks relating to the merger with august technology corporation the issuance of shares of nanometrics common stock to august technology stockholders in the merger will substantially reduce the percentage interests of nanometrics shareholders 
if we complete the merger  august technology shareholders will receive of a share of nanometrics common stock for each share of august technology common stock they own at the completion of the merger 
based on the number of shares of nanometrics and august technology outstanding on january   august technology shareholders would hold approximately of the fully diluted shares of common stock of the combined entity immediately after the merger  and nanometrics shareholders would hold approximately of the fully diluted shares of common stock of the combined entity immediately after the merger 
this would cause a significant reduction in the relative percentage interest of current nanometrics shareholders in earnings  voting  liquidation value and book and market value 
even though nanometrics and august technology have obtained the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger  governmental authorities could still seek to block or challenge the merger 
the merger is subject to review by the department of justice and the united states federal trade commission  or the ftc  under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended  or the hsr act 
under the hsr act  nanometrics and august technology are required to make pre merger notification filings and to await the expiration or early termination of the statutory waiting period prior to completing the merger 
all required regulatory filings have been made and we have been notified by the ftc that early termination of the waiting period associated with these filings has been granted and we have therefore obtained all regulatory clearances  consents and approvals required to complete the merger 
however  after the statutory waiting periods have expired  and even after completion of the merger  governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest 
in addition  in some jurisdictions  a competitor  customer or other third party could initiate a private action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the merger  before or after it is completed
