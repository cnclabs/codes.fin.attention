overview 
we produce and sell pulverized limestone  quicklime  hydrated lime and lime slurry 
the principal factors affecting our success are the level of demand for our products  and whether we are able to maintain sufficient production levels and product quality while controlling costs 

table of contents inclement weather conditions generally reduce the demand for lime and limestone products supplied to construction related customers that account for a significant amount of our revenues 
inclement weather also interferes with our open pit mining operations and can disrupt our plant production  as in the case of flooding and winter ice storms in texas in recent years 
demand for our products in our market areas is also affected by general economic conditions  the pace of home construction and the demand for steel  as well as the level of governmental funding for highway construction 
in recent years  the demand  especially by the steel industry  and prices for lime and limestone products have continued to improve 
the transportation equity act for the st century  which was the federal highway bill  expired on september  the general provisions of tea have been retained under continuing resolutions  most recently through may   to provide federal funding for highway construction 
new six year bills have been proposed by congress  including a bill that was passed by the house of representatives on march   and the administration that would increase the funding levels 
due to wide bi partisan support  a new bill is expected to pass  therefore  we believe there will be a continuing strong level of demand for lime and limestone products used in highway construction for the next few years 
our recent modernization and expansion projects in texas and arkansas  beginning in  have positioned us to meet the demand for high quality lime and limestone products in our markets  with our lime out put capacity nearly doubling and our limestone production capacity increasing approximately since these projects have also equipped us with up to date  fuel efficient plant facilities  which should result in lower production costs and greater operating efficiencies  thus enhancing our competitive position 
in order for our plants to operate at peak efficiency  we must meet operational challenges that arise from time to time  including bringing new facilities on line as well as operating existing facilities 
our primary variable cost is energy 
natural gas prices remain high  and solid fuel costs are also increasing 
we have been able to mitigate to some degree the adverse impact of those increases by varying the mixes of fuel used in our kilns  and by passing on some of our increased energy costs to our customers through higher prices and or surcharges on certain products 
we have not  to date  engaged in any significant hedging activity in an effort to control our energy costs 
we have  however  entered into forward purchase contracts for natural gas for the winter months  in order to provide greater predictability to this cost component  and we may do so again in the future 
we have also entered into pricing agreements for coal and petroleum coke for that include price increases averaging approximately for compared with prices 
in addition  we experienced delays in rail delivery of some of our coal requirements during due to the problems a major rail carrier experienced with its rail system 
this resulted in our having to purchase higher priced coal from sources other than our normal provider 
we financed our texas and arkansas modernization and expansion projects through a combination of a common stock rights offering to our shareholders  debt financing  including the issuance in august of  of unsecured subordinate notes  due  and cash flows from operations 
given our increased level of debt  we must generate sufficient cash flows to cover ongoing capital and debt service needs 
during  our cash flows from operations were strong  enabling us to prepay  of the original principal amount of the notes 
all of our remaining long term debt becomes due in and  and we will need to refinance our debt prior to maturity if not fully repaid by then 
with the second kiln and related storage capacity at arkansas completed  and the shreveport  louisiana distribution terminal refurbished  we have completed phase ii of our arkansas modernization and expansion project 
as a result of our texas and arkansas projects  our yearly depreciation  depletion and amortization expense included in cost of revenues increased from  in to  in  while our gross profit increased from  to  over the same period 
in addition  over that period  our interest expense has increased from  in to  in excluding approximately  of interest capitalized in  as the amount of our borrowings has increased 
during  we reduced our debt and future debt service needs  by refinancing our bank debt  reducing our interest rate to approximately from approximately  and the  prepayment of our subordinated notes  which bear a interest rate 

table of contents in order for us to continue to increase our profitability in the face of these increased fixed costs  we must maintain our revenues and cash flows  and continue to control our operational and selling  general and administrative expenses  including new corporate governance compliance costs resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of and associated regulatory requirements 
we also continue to explore ways to expand our operations and production capacity through additional capital projects and or acquisitions 
as of may   we entered into an eighteen month oil and gas lease agreement with eog resources  inc eog with respect to oil and gas rights on our cleburne  texas property 
the lease may be extended so long as eog is continuously developing the leased property as set forth in the lease 
pursuant to the lease  we have received lease bonus payments totaling  which are reflected in other income for in addition  we retained a royalty interest in oil and gas produced from any successful wells drilled on the leased property and an option to participate in any well drilled on the leased property as a working interest owner  provided we elect to participate prior to the commencement of each well 
as of the date of this report  eog has not commenced drilling on the leased property 
we believe that the enhanced production capacity resulting from our modernization and expansion efforts at the texas and arkansas plants and the operational strategies that we have implemented have allowed us to increase production  improve product quality  better serve existing customers  attract new customers and control our costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that demand and prices for our lime and limestone products will remain strong  that our production will not be adversely affected by weather related or other operational problems  that our results will not be adversely affected by continued increases in energy costs or new environmental requirements  or that our production capacity  revenues  net income and cash flows will continue to be strong 
critical accounting policies 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities  at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant management judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant management judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
we are required to estimate the collectability of our trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables and determining our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured 
payment terms for our trade receivables are based on underlying purchase orders  contracts or purchase agreements 
credit losses relating to these receivables consistently have been within management expectations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the terms of purchase orders  contracts or purchase agreements  which are generally upon shipment  and payment is considered probable 
long lived assets 
we review long term assets for impairment in accordance with the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that  when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we should determine if impairment of value exists 
if the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment exists and an impairment loss must be calculated and recorded 
if an impairment exists  the impairment loss is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value 
any impairment loss is treated as a permanent reduction in the carrying value of the asset 

table of contents deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that deferred tax assets would be realizable in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  should we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would not be realizable in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
environmental costs 
we record environmental accruals  based on studies and estimates  when it is probable that we have incurred a reasonably estimable liability 
the accruals are adjusted when further information warrants an adjustment 
environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
contingencies 
we are party to proceedings  lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business relating to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to estimate the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue  including coverage under our insurance policies 
this determination may change in the future because of new developments 
derivatives 
we record the fair value of our gas forward purchase contracts on our balance sheet  with the offsetting entry to other operating expense 
any subsequent mark to market adjustments result in an increase or decrease of other operating expense 
we record the fair value of our interest rate hedge on our balance sheet and include any changes in fair value in other comprehensive income loss 
warrant share put liability 
we estimate the fair value of our warrant share put liability quarterly based on the per share average closing price of our common stock for the last days of the quarter compared to the per share exercise price 
the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the warrant share put liability is being accreted  and the effect on fair value of future changes in the repurchase price for each share are accreted or decreted  over the five year period from the date of issuance to august   after which the warrant holders may require us to repurchase any or all shares acquired through exercise of the warrants 
therefore  increases in our per share common stock price result in an increased liability and increased interest expense from accretion 
pension plan 
we have one noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
all benefits for participants in the plan were frozen as of july  our costs  credits and funded status for this plan are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
future costs  credits and funded status for this plan may change should conditions warrant changes in the assumptions

due in part to continuing lime shortages principally in the eastern half of the united states  we sold substantially all of the increased lime production at arkansas during these shortages were primarily due to increased consumption of lime for steel related uses and the closing of three lime plants in the midwest in our gross profit increased to  for from  for  an increase of  or 
compared to  gross profit and gross profit margins increased in primarily due to the increase in lime sales volume  partially offset by a  increase in depreciation primarily attributable to depreciation of the new arkansas kiln

interest expense in increased to  from  in  an increase of  or 
the increase in interest expense in primarily resulted from the  prepayment penalty and the expensing of  unamortized prepaid financing costs  both of which resulted from our debt refinancing in august  and the private placement of  unsecured subordinated notes the sub notes in august in  interest expense related to the sub notes  including non cash interest costs and net of capitalized interest  was approximately  compared to approximately  in these were partially offset by the  of net repayments of our debt during and reduced

gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in  compared to in these increases were primarily due to the resolution of operational problems at the texas plant that occurred during the second and third quarter and the increase in pls sales volume 
these improvements were partially offset in by increased natural gas costs and a winter ice storm in texas that caused the loss of approximately two days of sales and a natural gas curtailment to the texas plant that resulted in reduced production levels during the first quarter the total negative price variance for natural gas in compared to was partially offset by natural gas surcharges on pls products implemented in early march sg a increased by  or  to  in  compared to  in as a percentage of sales  sg a declined to in from in the increase in sg a for was primarily attributable to increased insurance costs and employee compensation and benefits

net income increased  to  per share in  compared to net income of  per share for financial condition 
capital requirements 
we require capital primarily for seasonal working capital needs  normal recurring capital and re equipping projects and expansion projects 
our capital needs are met principally from cash flows from operations  our  revolving credit facility and our long term debt 

table of contents cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in  compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the improvement in was primarily the result of the  increase in net income and the  increase in non cash expenses compared to  partially offset by changes in working capital 
the most significant increases in non cash expenses in compared to were  of deferred income taxes   of depreciation  depletion and amortization and  of non cash interest expenses 
the increase in deferred income taxes resulted primarily from bonus depreciation for tax purposes on the new kiln and other capital additions during  which also accounted for the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization in the refinancing of our bank debt in august and the accretion of the debt discount and warrant shares repurchase liability were the reasons for the increase in non cash interest expense 
banking facilities and debt 
on august   we entered into a credit agreement with a new bank the lender that includes a five year  term loan the new term loan  and a three year  revolving credit facility the new revolving credit facility  together  the new credit facility 
at the closing of the new credit facility  we borrowed  the entire new term loan  and  on the new revolving credit facility to repay the outstanding balances  including a prepayment penalty and accrued interest  on our previous bank term loan and revolving credit facility 
pursuant to a security agreement  also dated august  the security agreement  the new term loan and the new revolving credit facility are secured by our existing and hereafter acquired tangible assets  intangible assets and real property 
we paid the lender an origination fee equal to of the total amount committed under the new credit facility 
the new term loan required a principal payment of  on september  and quarterly principal payments of  thereafter  which equates to a year amortization  with a final principal payment of  due on august  subject to continued compliance with financial covenants  we may make additional draws on the new revolving credit facility  which matures august  the lender may accelerate the maturity of the new term loan and the new revolving credit facility if any event of default  as defined under the new credit facility  occurs 
the new term loan and the new revolving credit facility bear interest  at our option  at libor plus a margin of to  or the lender s prime rate plus a margin of minus to plus 
the margins are determined quarterly in accordance with a defined rate spread based upon the ratio of our average total funded senior indebtedness for the preceding four quarters to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda for the twelve months ended on the last day of the most recent calendar quarter 
the margins were for libor and for prime rate loans during from august to december   the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings under the new term loan and the new revolving credit facility was approximately 
in conjunction with the new credit facility  we entered into a hedge to fix the libor rate for the new term loan at on  for the period september  through the maturity date  and on the remaining principal balance of approximately  for the period december  through the maturity date  resulting in an interest rate of for the new term loan based on the current margin of 
the hedges have been designated as cash flow hedges  and as such  changes in the fair market value are included in other comprehensive income loss 
the fair market value of the hedges at december  was a liability of  which is included in other liabilities on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
the new credit facility and security agreement contain covenants that restrict the incurrence of debt  guaranties and liens  and place restrictions on investments and the sale of significant assets 
we are also required to meet a minimum debt service coverage ratio and not exceed specified leverage ratios 
the new credit facility provides that we may pay annual dividends  not to exceed  so long as after such payment  we remain solvent and the payment does not cause or result in any default or event of default as defined under the new credit facility 
as a result of entering into the new credit facility and borrowings thereunder  we repaid all of the  then outstanding debt under our previous  senior secured term loan the old term loan and terminated the associated credit agreement that had been entered into on april  
table of contents with a consortium of commercial banks 
the old term loan was repayable over a period of approximately eight years  maturing on march   and required monthly principal payments of  which began april   with a final principal payment of  on march   which equated to a year amortization 
the interest rate on the first  borrowed under the old term loan was 
the subsequent installments bore interest from the date they were funded at above the secondary market yield of the united states treasury obligation maturing may  the blended rate for the additional  was 
upon the prepayment of the old term loan  we were required to pay a prepayment penalty of approximately  which was included in interest expense in the third quarter also  approximately  of unamortized financing costs relating to the old term loan was included in interest expense in the third quarter 
we also terminated our previous  revolving credit facility and repaid the  then outstanding principal balance 
in addition  the company had a  equipment line of credit available for financing or leasing large mobile equipment used in its operations from the bank that had issued the revolving credit facility  of which approximately  of operating lease obligations remained at december  the revolving credit facility was secured by our accounts receivable and inventories  provided for an interest rate of libor plus and originally matured on march  on december   the loan and security agreement had been amended to increase the revolving credit facility from  to  and extend the maturity to april  on august   we sold  of sub notes in a private placement under section of the securities act of to three accredited investors  one of which is an affiliate of inberdon enterprises ltd  the company s majority shareholder inberdon  and another of which is an affiliate of robert s 
beall  who owns approximately of our outstanding shares 
we believe that the terms of the private placement were more favorable to the company than proposals previously received 
frost securities  inc frost provided an opinion to our board of directors that  from a financial point of view  the private placement was fair to the unaffiliated holders of our common stock in relation to other potential subordinated debt transactions then available to us 
we paid frost an aggregate of  for its advice  placement services and opinion 
the net proceeds of approximately  from the private placement were primarily used to fund the phase ii expansion of our arkansas facilities 
terms of the sub notes include a maturity date of august   subject to acceleration upon a change in control  no mandatory principal payments prior to maturity  an interest rate of paid in cash and paid in cash or in kind at our option  and  except as discussed below  no optional prepayment prior to august  and a prepayment penalty in certain specified circumstances prior to august  if repaid before maturity 
the terms of the sub notes are identical to one another  except that the sub note for the affiliate of inberdon did not prohibit prepayment prior to august  and did not require a prepayment penalty if repaid before maturity  resulting in a weighted average prepayment penalty of approximately if the sub notes were repaid before maturity 
the sub notes require compliance with our other debt agreements and restrict the sale of significant assets 
the private placement also included six year detachable warrants  providing the sub note investors the right to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock  at of the average closing price of one share of common stock for the trailing trading days prior to closing  or 
the fair value of the warrants was recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the sub notes and is being accreted over the term of the sub notes  resulting in an effective annual interest rate of 
after august   or upon an earlier change in control  the investors may require the company to repurchase any or all shares acquired through exercise of the warrants the warrant shares 
the repurchase price for each warrant share will equal the average closing price of one share of the company s common stock for the trading days preceding the date the warrant shares are put back to the company 
changes in the repurchase price for each warrant share are accreted or decreted to interest expense over the five year period from the date of issuance 
table of contents to august  the investors are also entitled to certain registration rights for the resale of their warrant shares 
we made principal prepayments on the sub notes totaling  during  including full prepayment of the sub note held by the affiliate of inberdon 
pursuant to the terms of the sub notes  a  prepayment penalty was paid on  of the principal prepayments 
as of december   we had approximately  in total principal amount of debt outstanding  compared to approximately  at december   a decrease of  or 
capital expenditures 
we completed the modernization and expansion project at our cleburne  texas facility at the end of in addition  during the fourth quarter  we commissioned a new line for the production of pls at our cleburne  texas facility and  in  constructed an additional storage facility there 
the lack of reliability of a single pls production line had been a restraining factor on sales to several large customers requiring around the clock availability 
these investments have allowed us to better serve existing customers and to pursue new business opportunities  resulting in new pls customers 
the first of two phases of the arkansas modernization and expansion project began in the fourth quarter phase i involved the redevelopment of the quarry plant  rebuilding of the railroad to standard gauge  the purchase of a facility to establish an out of state terminal in shreveport  louisiana  the installation of a rotary kiln with preheater and increased product storage and loading capacity 
we completed phase i in the second quarter the arkansas phase ii expansion doubled the plant s quicklime production capacity through the installation of a second preheater rotary kiln and additional kiln run storage capacity substantially identical to the kiln system built in phase i 
construction of the second kiln system commenced in the third quarter and was completed with lime production from the new kiln beginning in late february the plans for phase ii also included refurbishing the distribution terminal in shreveport  louisiana  which is connected to a railroad  to provide lime storage  hydrating and distribution capacity to service markets in louisiana and east texas 
this terminal began operations in december we invested  in capital expenditures in  compared to  in approximately  and  of our capital expenditures related to the arkansas phase ii expansion project in and  respectively 
in  capital expenditures also included approximately  for the installation of a new kiln baghouse at our texas plant 
we also accrued approximately  of capital expenditures on our consolidated balance sheet at december  related to refurbishing of the shreveport terminal and the installation of the new kiln baghouse 
we expect to spend approximately  per year over the next several years for normal recurring capital and re equipping projects at the plant facilities to maintain or improve efficiency and reduce costs 
contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period more than contractual obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt  including current installments operating leases purchase obligations other liabilities total 
table of contents includes approximately for operating leases for mobile equipment entered into under the company s  equipment line of credit previously available for financing or leasing large mobile equipment used in its operations from the bank that had issued the revolving credit facility terminated in the august refinancing  and corporate office lease 
approximate amount of open equipment and construction orders  including orders related to the refurbishing of our shreveport terminal and the installation of the new kiln baghouse at our texas plant 
approximately  of these obligations are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at december  in current liabilities 
does not include unfunded projected benefit obligation for a defined benefit pension plan 
future required contributions  if any  are subject to actuarial assumptions and future earnings on plan assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
does not include potential liability for the repurchase of certain shares of our common stock 
future potential liability will vary with the market price of our common stock 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity 
at december   we had drawn down  on our  new revolving credit facility 
we believe that cash on hand  funds generated from operations and amounts available under the new revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating needs  ongoing capital needs and debt service for additionally  with our increase in cash flows from operations following the completion of our phase ii expansion project at arkansas and funds available from our  new revolving credit facility  we believe we will have sufficient capital resources to meet our liquidity needs for the near future and be able to refinance our long term debt prior to maturities in and  to the extent not fully repaid by then 
new accounting pronouncements 
stock options 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb and amends statement of accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r will require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  and permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the adoption date and based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the adoption date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
we plan to adopt the provisions of sfas r on july  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas and noted above  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and related interpretations 
as such  we generally do not recognize compensation expenses associated with employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations  although it will have no material impact on our overall financial condition 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures above 
we estimate that the adoption of 
table of contents sfas r  based on the outstanding unvested stock options at december   will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position 
sfas r also requires the tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may serve to reduce our future cash provided by operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities  to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position 
stripping costs in the mining industry 
the fasb emerging issues task force eitf recently announced that it had reached a consensus that stripping costs incurred after a mine begins production are costs of production and therefore should be accounted for as a component of inventory costs eitf issue no 

we currently capitalize certain stripping costs as deferred stripping costs  attribute them to the reserves that have been exposed and amortize them into cost of revenues using the units of production method 
as of december  and  we had  and  respectively  of capitalized deferred stripping costs 
the eitf stated that the new required accounting for stripping costs would be effective for years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we have not yet assessed the impact of this accounting change  nor determined when we will adopt this new consensus 
at this time  we are unable to determine the effects that adopting this accounting change will have on our financial position and the results of our operations when it is adopted 
inventory costs 
in december  the fasb issued fasb  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this amendment requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage to be recognized as current period charges 
this standard also requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are studying the provisions of this new pronouncement to determine the impact  if any  on our financial statements 
additional factors 
effects of leverage and restrictions imposed by terms of our indebtedness 
as a result of our modernization and expansion efforts over the last few years  we became more leveraged 
as of december   our total consolidated indebtedness and total stockholders equity were  and  respectively  and total indebtedness represented of total capitalization  compared to as of december  as a result of our total indebtedness  a large portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness 
our ability to service our debt and to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in the new credit facility and sub notes is subject to financial  economic  competitive and other factors 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in particular  our ability to service the indebtedness will depend upon our ability to sustain current levels of revenues and cash flows from operations as a result of the modernization and expansion of the texas and arkansas plants 
short term liquidity demands 
funds available under our  new revolving credit facility and funds generated from operations should allow us to meet current liquidity demands 
however  should our cash flows from operations deteriorate  we may have to obtain additional financing  and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so at favorable rates  given our current levels of indebtedness 
due to the seasonal nature of our sales and revenues  we may need to draw down from our new revolving credit facility during the first half to provide funds for necessary repayments of principal and interest on our debt  completion of our open construction projects  winter capital projects  normal recurring capital and re equipping projects and normal working capital needs 
if we make additional draws on the new revolving credit facility in the first half  we expect to repay any such draws during the second half 
table of contents factors that could affect our success 
in the normal course of our business operations  we face risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and competitive position 
not all risks are foreseeable or within our ability to control 
these risks arise from factors including  but not limited to  fluctuating demand for lime and limestone products  our ability to produce and store quantities of lime and limestone products sufficient in amount and quality to meet customer demands  the success of our modernization and expansion strategies  including our ability to execute the strategies and complete projects on time and within budget  our access to capital  costs  especially natural gas and other energy prices  inclement weather and the effects of seasonal trends 
environmental compliance 
we incur environmental compliance costs  including capital costs  maintenance and operating costs with respect to pollution control facilities  the cost of ongoing monitoring programs  the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs and liabilities relating to our compliance with environmental laws 
the rate of change of such laws has been rapid over the last decade  and compliance can require significant expenditures 
we believe that our expenditure requirements for future environmental compliance will continue to increase as operational and reporting standards increase 
discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures 
we intend to comply with all environmental laws and believe that our accrual for environmental costs at december  is reasonable 
because many of the requirements are subjective and therefore not quantifiable or presently determinable  or may be affected by future legislation and rulemaking  it is not possible to accurately predict the aggregate future costs of compliance and their effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position 
successful execution of expansion projects 
we may initiate various capital projects and or acquisitions to expand our operations and production capacity 
these would most likely require that we incur additional debt 
notwithstanding current demand for lime and limestone products  we cannot guarantee that any such project or acquisition would be successful  that we will be able to sell any resulting increased production or that any such sales will be profitable 
competition 
the lime industry is highly regionalized and competitive 
our competitors are predominately private companies 
the primary competitive factors in the lime industry are quality  price  ability to meet customer demand  proximity to customers  personal relationships and timeliness of deliveries  with varying emphasis on these factors depending upon the specific product application 
to the extent that one or more of our competitors becomes more successful with respect to any key competitive factor  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position could be materially adversely affected 
although demand and prices for lime and limestone have been improving in recent years  we are unable to predict future demand and prices  and cannot provide any assurance that current levels of demand and prices will continue or that any future increases in demand or price can be sustained 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
we are exposed to commodity price risk related to the price volatility of natural gas utilized at our plants 
from time to time  we enter into forward purchase contracts for the delivery of a portion of our natural gas requirements 
at december   we had committed to purchase  mmbtu for january at a price of per mmbtu 
as of december   the market price for deliveries for january was approximately per mmbtu 
we recorded a mark to market adjustment resulting in an increase of approximately  in other operating expenses at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of floating interest rates on our new term loan and new revolving credit facility 
because the sub notes bear a fixed rate of interest  changes in interest rates do not subject us to changes in future interest expense with this borrowing 

table of contents at december   we had  of indebtedness outstanding under floating rate debt 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to swap floating rates for fixed rates at  plus the applicable margin  through maturity on the new term loan balance of  leaving the  new revolving credit facility balance subject to interest rate risk at december  assuming no additional borrowings or repayments on the new revolving credit facility  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense and a decrease in income before taxes of approximately  per year 
this amount has been estimated by calculating the impact of such hypothetical interest rate increase on our non hedged  floating rate debt of  outstanding under the new revolving credit facility at december  and assuming it remains outstanding over the next twelve months 
additional borrowings under the new revolving credit facility would increase this estimate

warrant shares repurchase obligation 
after august   or upon an earlier change of control  the sub note investors may require us to repurchase any or all of the  shares that they may purchase by exercising the company s outstanding warrants 
the repurchase price for each share is equal to the average closing price of one share of our common stock for the trading days preceding the date the shares are put back to the company 
at december   the fair value of the warrant share put liability was estimated to be  based on the per share average closing price for the last trading days of the december  carrying value for this liability was  the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the warrant put liability is being accreted  and the effect on fair value of future changes in the repurchase price for each share are accreted or decreted  to interest expense over the five year period from the date of issuance to august  thereafter  the warrant share put liability will be marked to market  with any adjustment increasing or decreasing interest expense
