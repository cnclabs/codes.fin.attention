the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing in appendix b of this annual report on form k

our agreements permit customers to exchange course titles  generally on the contract anniversary date 
additional services  such as hosting and online mentoring are subject to additional fees

the pricing for our referenceware licenses varies based on the collections specified by a customer  the number of users within the customer s organization and the length of the license agreement 
we offer discounts from our ordinary pricing in arrangements covering larger numbers of courses  for larger user bases or for longer periods 
generally  customers may amend their license agreements  for an additional fee  to gain access to additional courses or product lines and or to increase the size of the user base 
we also derive revenue from hosting fees for clients that use our solutions on an application service provider asp basis  online mentoring services and professional services 
in selected circumstances  we derive revenue on a pay for use basis under which some customers are charged based on the number of courses accessed by users 
revenue derived from pay for use contracts has been minimal to date 
cost of revenue includes the cost of materials such as storage media  packaging  shipping and handling  cd duplication  the cost of online mentoring and hosting services  royalties and certain infrastructure and occupancy expenses 
we generally recognize these costs as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  certain infrastructure and occupancy expenses  fees to consultants and course content development fees 
we account for software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  which requires the capitalization of certain computer software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is established 
to date we have expensed all software development costs as incurred  as those costs  which would have otherwise qualified for capitalization  have been immaterial 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits  advertising and promotion  travel and certain infrastructure and occupancy expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  consulting and service expenses  legal expenses  other public company costs and certain infrastructure and occupancy expenses 
deferred compensation consists of two components the value of unvested options assumed in the books acquisition and the merger  and difference between the exercise or sale price of share options granted or restricted common stock sold during the year ended january  and the fair market value of the common stock as determined for accounting purposes 
the deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying share option or shares

sec investigation and other professional fees primarily consist of charges associated with  and as a result of  the restatement of smartforce s financial statements for   and the first two quarters of  the re filing of statutory tax returns as a result of the restatement and charges for the ongoing sec investigation 
business outlook in the fiscal year ended january  we generated revenues of million  an increase compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  we find ourselves in a challenging business environment 
the overall market adoption rate for e learning solutions continues to be relatively slow and we are seeing constraints on it spending  by our current and potential customers 
as a result  we are experiencing delays in customer orders and some non renewals of contracts from existing customers 
in addition  price competition in the e learning market is having a negative impact on the revenue we are generating from the new contracts and the contract renewals we do succeed in obtaining 
on the positive side  our recent revenue growth and our growth prospects are strongest in our product lines focused on informal learning  such as our booksx products 
as a result we have increased our research and development spending in order to invest aggressively in those areas and accelerate the time by which our planned new products will be available to our customers 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our content development organization to more efficiently manage costs and capitalize further on the flexibility inherent in our existing outsourcing model 
the goal of the restructuring is to enable us to meet our existing content production targets at a reduced cost and with greater flexibility with respect to the product offerings in which we elect to make investments 
the restructuring involved the elimination of jobs in dublin  ireland and in nashua  new hampshire  as well as facilities consolidation in dublin 
we will shift the remainder of our it skills content development activities to our outsourcing suppliers  while continuing to maintain project management and quality control internally 
this restructuring included a reduction of an additional jobs in nashua  new hampshire for a rightsizing of our sales operation and jobs in germany related to the shutdown of our german facility 
we incurred restructuring charges related to payments to terminated employees  facilities consolidation and the repayment of grants previously awarded by irish agencies 
these charges totaled approximately million and were incurred in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year 
we believe that the restructuring will result in content development cost savings of approximately million per year at current production levels  beginning in the next fiscal year 
this will afford us more flexibility to reinvest dollars that can be recaptured in an outsourcing model for other research and development initiatives and or to increase the profitability of the organization 
in order to fully focus on the multi modal learning mml business we have entered into a non binding letter of intent with respect to the sale of certain assets of our retail it certification business  smartcertify the retail certification business 
in the event the transaction is not consummated as anticipated  we will shut down the operation 
the retail certification business is focused on direct to consumer business and has contributed less revenue than expected 
this planned action will allow us to fully focus our attention and resources on our core enterprise business 
we engaged an investment banker to assist us in eliciting acquisition proposals for this business 
the process has progressed and we are now in discussions with a buyer to the point where we expect to consummate a transaction in the fiscal first quarter 
we are now working to finalize sale terms with a potential purchaser 
if smartcertify is sold  we will maintain a reseller arrangement with the new organization 
if we shut down the operation  a plan to do so would be established 
such a plan would outline a timeline and schedule of costs associated with the shutdown 
we would not maintain a reseller arrangement under a shutdown scenario 
in either a shutdown or a sale scenario  we will maintain the existing customer contracts and service those contracts until the contractual obligation is 
table of contents fulfilled 
this decision process is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of fiscal whether smartcertify is sold or shut down  we anticipate recognizing revenue from the deferred revenue balance related to direct to consumer business over the succeeding to months following the sale or shutdown 
substantially all of the sales  marketing and administrative costs  on a going forward basis following a sale or shutdown  will be eliminated 
we recorded a charge of approximately m in the fiscal quarter ended january  as a result of the impairment of the goodwill asset allocated to the retail certification business 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  we believe the accounting policies described below are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require application of significant judgment by our management 
in applying these policies  management uses its judgment in making certain assumptions and estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the license of products and services and from providing hosting application service provider asp services 
we follow the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop to account for revenue derived pursuant to license agreements under which customers license our products and services 
the pricing for our courses varies based upon the number of course titles or the courseware bundle licensed by a customer  the number of users within the customer s organization and the length of the license agreement generally one  two or three years 
license agreements permit customers to exchange course titles  generally on the contract anniversary date 
additional product features  such as hosting and online mentoring services  are separately licensed for an additional fee 
the pricing for our smml licenses varies based on the choice of smml  content offering selected by the customer  the number of users within the customer s organization and the length of the license agreement 
a smml license provides customers access to a full range of learning products including courseware  referenceware  simulations  mentoring and prescriptive assessment 
a referenceware license gives users access to the full library within one or more collections examples of which are itpro  businesspro  financepro and officeessentials books 
the pricing for our referenceware licenses varies based on the collections specified by a customer  the number of users within the customer s organization and the length of the license agreement 
we offer discounts from its ordinary pricing  and purchasers of licenses for larger numbers of courses  for larger user bases or for longer periods generally receive discounts 
generally  customers may amend their license agreements  for an additional fee  to gain access to additional courses or product lines and or to increase the size of the user base 
we also derive revenue from hosting fees for clients that use its solutions on an asp basis  online mentoring services and professional services 
in selected circumstances  we derive revenue on a pay for use basis under which some customers are charged based on the number of courses accessed by users 
revenue derived from pay for use contracts has been minimal to date 
we recognize revenue ratably over the license period if the number of courses that a customer has access to is not clearly defined  available  or selected at the inception of the contract  or if the contract has additional undelivered elements for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the various elements 
this may occur if the customer does not specify all licensed courses at the outset  the customer chooses to wait for future licensed courses on a when and if available basis  the customer is given exchange privileges that are exercisable other than on the contract anniversaries  or the customer licenses all courses currently available and to be developed during the term of the arrangement 
nearly all of our contractual arrangements result in the recognition of revenue ratably over the license period 

table of contents we also derives revenue from extranet hosting asp services and online mentoring services 
the company recognizes revenue related to extranet hosting asp services and online mentoring services on a straight line basis over the period the services are provided 
we generally bill the annual license fee for the first year of a multi year agreement in advance and license fees for subsequent years of multi year license arrangements are billed on the anniversary date of the agreement 
occasionally  we bill customers on a quarterly basis 
in some circumstances  we offer payment terms of up to six months from the initial shipment date or anniversary date for multi year agreements to its customers 
to the extent that a customer is given extended payment terms defined by us as greater than six months  revenue is recognized as cash becomes due  assuming all of the other elements of revenue recognition have been satisfied 
we typically recognize revenue from resellers when both the sale to the end user has occurred and the collectibility of cash from the reseller is probable 
with respect to reseller agreements with minimum commitments  we recognize revenue related to the portion of the minimum commitment that exceeds the end user sales at the expiration of the commitment period provided we have received payment 
we provide professional services  including instructor led training  customized content  websites  and implementation services 
we recognize professional service revenue as the services are performed 
we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both maintenance and services revenues and as a direct cost of maintenances and services in accordance with eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf 
eitf requires reimbursable out of pocket expenses incurred to be characterized as revenue in the income statement 
we record as deferred revenue amounts that have been billed in advance for products or services to be provided 
deferred revenue includes the unamortized portion of revenue associated with license fees for which we have received payment or for which amounts have been billed and are due for payment in days or less for resellers and days or less for direct customers 
in addition  deferred revenue includes amounts which have been billed and not collected for which revenue is being recognized ratably over the license period 
amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill we record intangible assets as historical cost 
we amortize our intangible assets which include customer contracts and internally developed software 
we review these intangible assets at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 
we also review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment which includes trademarks and tradenames 
we test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the test  we calculate the fair value of the reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates 
we obtain a valuation report from an independent third party as part of our assessment process 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based employee compensation plans on the intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations under apb no 
we provide pro forma disclosures only of the compensation expense determined under the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

see recent accounting pronouncements for a description of fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment 

table of contents deferral of commissions we employ an accounting policy consistent with guidance provided by fasb technical bulletin and sec staff accounting bulletin  related to the concept of a direct and incremental relationship between revenue and expense 
as such  we defer the recognition of commission expense until such time as the revenue related to the contract for which the commission was paid is recognized 
restructuring charges we account for our restructuring activities under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas states that a liability related to and exit or disposal activity should be recognized at fair value in the period in which it is incurred 
costs covered by sfas include  but are not limited to  the following one time involuntary termination benefits provided to employees under the terms of a benefit arrangement that  in substance  is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or a deferred compensation contract  certain contract termination costs  including operating lease termination costs and other associated costs 
as such  when we identify restructuring charges that fulfill the requirements identified in sfas as incurred  we record the charges in our statement of operations 
legal contingencies in connection with any material legal proceedings that we may become involved in  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with our outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated

the segment defers revenue at the time of sale over to months 
we exited the fiscal year ended january  with noncancellable backlog of approximately million as compared to million at january  this amount is calculated by combining the amount of deferred revenue at our fiscal year end with the amounts to be added to deferred revenue throughout the next twelve months as a result of committed customer contracts and determining how much of these amounts are scheduled to amortize into revenue over the next twelve months 
the amount scheduled to amortize into revenue over the next twelve months is disclosed as backlog 
amounts to be added to deferred revenue throughout the next twelve months include subsequent billings for ongoing contract periods as well as billings for new or continuing contracts 
company management has included this non gaap disclosure due to the fact that it is directly related to our subscription based revenue recognition policy 
this is a key business metric  which factors into our forecasting and planning activities and provides visibility 
table of contents into fiscal revenue 
we expect revenues related to informal learning and tele sales distribution initiatives to increase in fiscal however  due to market and pricing pressures on our core products we anticipate mml revenue to be flat or slightly down in fiscal compared to fiscal we publicly announced our intention to shutdown the retail certification business or sell certain assets related to the business 
either scenario would have a negative impact on revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal year ended january  change revenue united states international total revenue increased by and in the united states and internationally  respectively  in the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the fiscal year ended january  the international revenue increase was due  in addition to the factors discussed above  to increased reseller revenue due to the timing of receipt of sell through reporting and cash from resellers 
the united states represented and of revenue for the fiscal year ended january  and  respectively 
fiscal year ended january  change revenue multi modal learning retail certification total revenue increased by and in the mml and retail certification segments  respectively  in the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the fiscal year ended january  the revenue increase for mml was primarily due to revenue generated from new business primarily derived from our product lines focused on informal learning 
the revenue increase for retail certification was primarily due to sales to new customers as well as the full recognition of the segment s subscription based revenue recognition model 
the segment defers revenue at the time of sale over to months 
the mml segment represented and of revenues for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
costs and expenses cost of revenue increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  this increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes as well as increased use of contract services and infrastructure charges incurred in connection with our efforts to consolidate hosting sites 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was in both the fiscal year ended january  and the fiscal year ended january  research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in the fiscal year ended january  from in the fiscal year ended january  research and development for the fiscal year ended january  included expenses of million to modify and enhance the technology we purchased that will underlie our virtual classroom product offering  skillsoft dialogue 
the decrease in expenses compared to fiscal was primarily due to our completion of the initiative for content and platform improvements in the quarter ended january  we plan to incur incremental costs in fiscal to pursue informal learning opportunities and accelerate their market introduction 

table of contents selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  the increase was primarily due to increased compensation and benefit costs of approximately million as a result of increased commissions derived from increased bookings in fiscal as compared to fiscal we also incurred additional expenses associated with building the skillsoft dialogue direct sales channel 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in certain infrastructure and occupancy charges of million 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in the fiscal year ended january  from in the fiscal year ended january   due to the increase in revenue between fiscal years 
we anticipate incurring incremental selling and marketing expenses over the next fiscal year in relation to bringing our virtual classroom offerings to the market 
we believe that a significant investment in selling and marketing to expand our distribution channels worldwide is required to remain competitive and we will be investing in our new tele sales distribution capabilities 
however  due to the anticipated reduction in revenue and related commission expense we expect our selling and marketing costs to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal and remain flat as a percentage of revenue 
the dollar decrease in selling and marketing expenses will also be supported by the shutdown or sale of certain assets of the retail certification business 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in the fiscal year ended january  from in the fiscal year ended january  these decreases were primarily due to a reduction of litigation costs of million in the fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue over the next fiscal year due primarily to continued increases in the costs of operating as a public company such as costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  advisory services  legal representation and insurance coverage 
we had no litigation settlement expenses in the fiscal year ended january  we recorded million in the fiscal year ended january  this related primarily to the settlements of the securities class action litigation million  the netg litigation million  the class action litigation million and the iplearn litigation million 
stock based compensation expense decreased  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  the expense relates to amortization of deferred compensation resulting from granting of stock options to employees at exercise prices below the fair market value of the stock and the sales of restricted common stock with sales prices below the fair market value of the stock 
the stock options granted and restricted stock sold at prices below fair market value of the stock were granted by skillsoft corporation prior to its initial public offering and by books prior to its acquisition by skillsoft corporation in december in addition  we recorded a one time compensation charge of  in the fiscal year ended january  due to the extension of certain option agreements 
amortization of intangible assets decreased  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we evaluated the fair value of goodwill 
in november of we hired an investment banker to actively market the retail certification reporting unit to third party buyers 
however by january  the investment banker reported the efforts to sell the business were unsuccessful 
on march   we entered into a non binding letter of intent with respect to the sale of our retail it certification business and if the transaction is not consummated we will shut down the operation 
the terms of the potential sale involve the transfer of certain assets and liabilities of the business in exchange for nominal consideration and the execution of a reseller agreement with the buyer 
consequently  based on our attempts to sell the business and the results of a valuation done by an independent third party valuation firm  it is our conclusion that the retail certification reporting unit has no goodwill 
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the fiscal year ended january  we prepared a cash flow analysis for 
table of contents the mml segment comparing the discounted cash flows to the net book values of the direct assets  goodwill and intangible assets 
the discounted cash flows supported the direct assets  goodwill and intangible assets of the mml learning business unit 
at january   we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill for the mml business unit 
the key assumptions utilized in the preparation of forecasted statements of operations for the mml segment  which reflect certain new initiatives were as follows multi modal learning revenue compound annual growth of gross profit research and development selling and marketing general and administrative other income expense million for all years working capital of gross revenue an independent third party utilized the aforementioned forecasted statements of operations in order to develop an analysis of discounted cash flows for the mml segment 
restructuring charges increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  this increase was due to the fiscal fourth quarter restructuring related to content development which included charges related to payments to terminated employees  facilities consolidation  the repayment of grants previously awarded by irish agencies as a result of the headcount reduction and the closing of our german facility 
we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional charges in fiscal as a result of these restructuring activities 
sec investigation charges increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  other professional fees decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  the decrease is due to the completion of the restatement of the smartforce historical financial statements in the fiscal year ended january  charges for the fiscal year ended january  consist primarily of the re filing of certain international tax returns and statutory financial statements as a result of the restatement 
there remain certain historical statutory and income tax filings in certain international jurisdictions that are required to be filed in connection with the aforementioned restatement 
we expect this process to continue throughout fiscal year interest income  net interest income decreased to  in the year ended january  from  in the year ended january  this decrease was primarily due to fewer funds available for investment and lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
other expense income  net other income expense  net decreased to  in the year ended january  from  in the year ended january   this decrease was primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations 
due to our multinational operations  our business is subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies used in our business

table of contents revenue revenue increased million  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  this increase was due to the addition of revenue from smartforce s historical customer base as well as revenue generated from new business 
as combined company revenue is only included after the closing of the merger the fiscal year ended january  does not include a full year of combined company revenue 
for the fiscal year ended january  renewal rates improved reflecting increased customer satisfaction  partially offset by a cautious corporate spending environment 
we exited the year ended january  with noncancellable backlog  consisting of deferred revenue and committed contracts  of approximately million as compared to million a year ago 
the increase in noncancellable backlog is due primarily to improved renewal rates  expanded offerings for mml customers and new customers

costs and expenses cost of revenue increased million  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was in the fiscal year ended january  versus in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal  increased costs of supporting the legacy smartforce hosting business and royalty fees associated with the legacy smartforce it product line 
the decrease in percentage of revenue was primarily due to cost efficiencies  primarily from reduced infrastructure costs  achieved as a result of the merger 
research and development increased million  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  this increase was due in part to the addition of smartforce s research and development organization 
in addition  we incurred million in incremental costs associated with modifying the smartforce content to be compliant with skillsoft standards and practices and million in incremental research and development costs associated with our initiatives related to content offerings and improvements and platform improvements 
these incremental costs were substantially complete at january  we believe our outsourcing strategy for some of our courses  which allows us to offer a broader set of content  provides us significant flexibility to control these costs

selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in the fiscal year ended january  from in the fiscal year ended january  the large percentage decrease was primarily due to the significant increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal general and administrative expenses increased million  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in the fiscal year ended january  from in the fiscal year ended january  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars primarily due to approximately million of increased costs associated with being a public company  including legal  audit  insurance and sarbanes oxley act compliance 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to the impact of a full year of additional personnel related costs due to the merger 
the large percentage decrease from fiscal to fiscal was mainly due to a significant increase in revenue in fiscal litigation settlement expenses were million in the fiscal year ended january  this related primarily to the settlements of the securities class action litigation million  the netg litigation million  the class action litigation million and the iplearn litigation million 
stock based compensation expense increased  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  the expense relates to amortization of deferred compensation resulting from granting of stock options to employees at exercise prices below the fair market value of the stock and the sales of restricted common stock with sales prices below the fair market value of the stock 
the stock options granted and restricted stock sold at prices below fair market value of the stock were granted by skillsoft corporation prior to its initial public offering and by books prior to its acquisition by skillsoft corporation in december in addition we recorded a one time compensation charge of  in the fiscal year ended january  due to the extension of certain option agreements until the registration statement on form s covering such option agreements  which was suspended as a result of our delay in filing a form k a containing the historical smartforce financial statements  was again available for use 
amortization of intangible assets increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  restructuring charges decreased million  or  to million in the year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  the restructuring charges relate to the merger and primarily consist of compensation costs for certain terminated smartforce employees and facilities consolidation 
professional fees related to the restatement of smartforce historical financial statements charges increased million  or  to million in the year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  these charges primarily consist of costs directly related to the restatement of the smartforce historical financial statements which was completed in the fiscal year ended january  in response to several factors in the fourth quarter of fiscal and as part of our annual impairment test  we re evaluated the fair value of the goodwill established in connection with the merger and the books acquisition 
factors that contributed to our decision to re evaluate the fair value of goodwill included i the determination that we would need to restate the historical financial statements of smartforce plc for the years ended december   and and the six months ended june   ii forecasted revenue decreased from the levels utilized prior to the merger  and 
table of contents iii upon the announcement of the restatement in november  there was a dramatic decline in our share price in relation to the price utilized in the calculation of purchase price 
the share price at time of the merger was per share  the share price on the day prior to the announcement of the restatement was per share and the share price at the close of business on the day of the announcement was per share  approximately a decline in share price 
we prepared a cash flow analysis by reporting segment comparing the discounted cash flows to the net book values of the tangible assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets associated with the two reporting units mml and retail certification 
the key assumptions utilized in the preparation of forecasted statements of operations for each segment were as follows multi modal learning retail certification revenue compound annual growth through growth of growth through no growth thereafter gross profit research and development  through thereafter selling and marketing  through  through  thereafter  through  thereafter general and administrative of sales growth   through through   declining to in thereafter and thereafter other income expense million for all years none working capital of gross revenue of gross revenue an independent third party utilized the aforementioned forecasted statements of operations in order to develop an analysis of discounted cash flows for each segment 
the discounted cash flows did not support the tangible assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of the mml reporting unit 
however  the discounted cash flows did support the value of the retail certification reporting unit 
the discounted cash flow analysis reflected many factors including a reduction in expected revenues for the fiscal year ended january  due to the elimination of three non core businesses telecom  prokoda services and custom global services and to a lesser extent  lower than anticipated revenues in relation to those revenues anticipated prior to the merger 
we have assumed growth in the e learning sector to be lower than originally considered at the time of the merger 
we have also valued our current customer base  including the synergies from cross selling our products  content  technology  trademarks and net operating loss carry forwards 
the cash flow analysis indicated the discounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the assets of the mml segment 
accordingly  we recorded a million impairment to goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to this segment 
in connection with the merger  we decided to exit the telecom business and sold the business as of january  as more fully described in note b of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  other income expense includes the results of operations for the period from september  through january  of the telecom business 
the assets and liabilities of the telecom business were excluded from our opening balance sheet and therefore  were excluded from the calculation of purchase price and the valuation of the goodwill asset 
the prokoda business was downsized at the time of merger and has only recently been eliminated 
the downsizing of the prokoda business at the time of merger resulted in the creation of liabilities associated with the severance of those employees identified as redundant 
the custom global services business has not been eliminated  but has evolved from the form in which it was acquired 
the acquiring entity  skillsoft corporation  had engaged in an outsourcing strategy to handle custom services requirements prior to the date of the merger september  
at the time of the merger we downsized our direct custom services staff and now handle customer needs with a solution that incorporates employees and outsourcing partners 
the downsizing of the custom global services business at time of the merger 
table of contents resulted in the creation of liabilities associated with the severance of those employees identified as redundant as well as for facilities idled as a result of the headcount reduction 
all businesses were acquired as a part of the merger 
the telecom business did not contribute any revenue and contributed approximately a  loss to our consolidated operations 
the prokoda business contributed approximately million in revenue and a million loss  to our consolidated operations 
the custom global services business contributed approximately million in revenue and approximately a  loss  to our consolidated operations 
interest income expense  net interest income  net decreased to  in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this decrease was primarily due to less funds available for investment and lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
other income expense  net other income expense  net increased to  in the year ended january  from  in the year ended january   this increase was primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations and secondarily due to gains on sales of certain capital assets 
due to our multinational operations  our business is subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies used in our business 
gain on sale of investments  net gain on sale of investments  net  was million in the fiscal year ended january  this was primarily related to a gain of million from the sale of an equity investment

this compares to million at january  net cash used in operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  our net cash used for the fiscal year ended january  most significantly reflects a decrease in accrued expenses of million primarily as a result of litigation settlement payments of approximately million for the final installment of the class action lawsuit  approximately million for the final installment of the netg lawsuit  and approximately million for the first installment of the class action lawsuit partially offset by an increase of million of deferred revenue and a decrease of million in prepaid expenses and the net impact of various other operating activities 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  the reduction of the need to designate restricted cash under our facility lease arrangements generated a cash inflow of million  which was partially offset by maturities of investments  net of purchases short and long term  which generated a net cash outflow of approximately million and the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million  including additions for additional hosting and development infrastructure  improvements to certain leaseholds and various other office equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  cash was provided from proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our various stock plans and stock purchases under our employee share purchase plan of million was partially offset by the million purchase of treasury stock 
our working capital deficit was approximately million and million as of january  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital deficit in the fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  was primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our various stock plans and stock purchases under the employee share purchase plan of million  depreciation and amortization of million impairment charge of million  which was offset primarily by a net loss of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  purchases of long term investments of million  and million of accrued litigation settlement now due in less than months

on july  we entered into a million two year  line of credit with a bank 
under the terms of the line of credit  the bank holds a first security interest in all domestic business assets 
all borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
the facility is subject to a commitment fee of  to secure the line of credit and unused commitment fees of based upon the daily average of un advanced amounts under the revolving line of credit 
we paid approximately  in unused commitment fees for the fiscal year ended january  in addition  the line of credit contains certain financial and non financial covenants 
at january   we were unable to attain one of the financial covenants set forth in the line of credit 
with a net loss of approximately million for the quarter ended january   we did not meet the minimum quarterly profitability of million for the quarter 
we were unable to meet the financial covenant due to the restructuring and impairment charges recorded in the quarter 
the bank agreed to amend the original loan agreement and issue a first loan modification agreement 
the first loan modification agreement has been executed and we are currently in compliance with all covenants 
also  the line of credit agreement provides that in the event of a material adverse change as defined in the line of credit agreement  the lender has the ability to call amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
as of january  there were no borrowings on the line of credit  however we had outstanding letters of credit of million that reduced the availability under the line of credit 
letters of credit are subject to commission fees of as well as administrative costs 
we paid approximately  in letters of credit fees for the fiscal year ended january  as of january   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million 
these nols  which are subject to potential limitations based upon change in control provisions of section of the internal revenue code  are available to reduce future taxable income  if any  through we also had us federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million at january  additionally  we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in jurisdictions outside of the us if not utilized  these carryforwards expire at various dates through the year ending january  included in the million are approximately million of us net operating loss carryforwards and  of us tax credit carryforwards that were acquired in the merger and the purchase of books 
in addition  included in the million we have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in jurisdictions outside the us acquired in the merger and the purchase of books 
we will realize the benefits of these acquired net operating losses through reductions to goodwill and non goodwill intangibles during the period that the losses are utilized to reduce tax payments 
also included in the million at january   we have approximately million of net operating loss 
table of contents carryforwards in the united states resulting from disqualifying dispositions 
we will realize the benefit of these losses through increases to stockholder s equity in the periods in which the losses are utilized to reduce tax payments 
we lease certain of our facilities and certain equipment and furniture under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through future minimum lease payments  net of estimated rentals  under these agreements are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations additionally  we have a remaining payout to be made in the fiscal year ending january  of million relating to the settlement of the securities class action litigation described in note c 
we expect to continue to experience growth in capital expenditures and operating expenses  particularly in sales and marketing and research and development  in the fiscal year ending january   as compared to the fiscal year ended january  in order to execute our business plan and achieve expected revenue growth 
to the extent that our execution of the business plan results in increased sales  we expect to experience corresponding increases in deferred revenue  cash flow and prepaid expenses 
in addition  we are required to make litigation settlement payments totaling million in the fiscal year ending january  we are in discussions with our insurers to determine how much  if any  of the settlement related to the securities class action lawsuits will be paid by them 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending january  are expected to be approximately million 
we have approval of our board of directors and shareholders to purchase up to  of our outstanding shares  although there are limitations on our ability to purchase up to this level which include distributable profit limitations under irish regulations and available cash 
we expect that the principal sources of funding for our operating expenses  capital expenditures  litigation settlement payments and other liquidity needs will be a combination of our available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which totaled approximately million as of january   and funds generated from future cash flows 
we believe our current funds and expected cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds 
in addition  our cash needs may increase due to factors such as unanticipated developments in our business or significant acquisitions 
the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon the successful execution of our business plan 
although we do not foresee the need to raise additional capital  any unanticipated economic or business events could require us to raise additional capital to support operations 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  and must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  on april   the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for statement r 
the new rule allows companies to implement statement r at the beginning of their next fiscal year 
early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on february  
table of contents a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have not yet determined which method to use in adopting sfas r 
explanation of use of non gaap financial results in addition to our audited financial results in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  to assist investors we may on occasion provide certain non gaap financial results as an alternative means to explain our periodic results 
the non gaap financial results typically may exclude non cash or one time charges or benefits 
our management uses the non gaap financial results internally as an alternative means for assessing our results of operations 
by excluding non cash charges such as stock based compensation  amortization of purchased intangible assets  impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets  management can evaluate our operations excluding these non cash charges and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies in our industry 
by excluding one time charges such as restructuring charges benefits  our management can compare our ongoing operations to prior quarters where such items may be materially different and to ongoing operations of other companies in our industry who may have materially different one time charges 
our management recognizes that non gaap financial results are not a substitute for gaap results  and believes that non gaap measures are helpful in assisting them in understanding and managing our business 
our management believes that the non gaap financial results may also provide useful information to investors 
non gaap results may also allow investors and analysts to more readily compare our operations to prior financial results and to the financial results of other companies in the industry who similarly provide non gaap results to investors and analysts 
investors may seek to evaluate our business performance and the performance of our competitors as they relate to cash 
excluding one time and non cash charges may assist investors in this evaluation and comparisons 
we intend to continue to assess the potential value of reporting non gaap results consistent with applicable rules and regulations 
future operating results risks related to legal proceedings in connection with our restatement of the historical financial statements of smartforce  class action lawsuits have been filed against us and additional lawsuits may be filed  and we are the subject of a formal order of private investigation entered by the sec 
while preparing the closing balance sheet of smartforce as at september   the date on which we closed our merger with skillsoft corporation  certain accounting matters were identified relating to the historical financial statements of smartforce which  following the merger  are no longer our historical financial statements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on november   we announced our intent to restate the smartforce financial statements for   and the first two quarters of we have settled several class action lawsuits that were filed following the announcement of the restatement 
we are the subject of a formal order of private investigation entered by the sec 
we are cooperating with the sec in connection with this investigation 
we will likely incur substantial costs in connection with the sec investigation  which could cause a diversion of management time and attention 
in addition  we could be subject to substantial penalties  fines or regulatory sanctions  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents claims that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others could result in costly litigation or royalty payments to third parties  or require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or services 
third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation or require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or services  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
infringement claims could also result in an injunction in the use of our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the combined company or at all 
from time to time we learn of parties that claim broad intellectual property rights in the e learning area that might implicate our offerings 
these parties or others could initiate actions against us in the future 
we could incur substantial costs resulting from product liability claims relating to our customers use of our products and services 
many of the business interactions supported by our products and services are critical to our customers businesses 
any failure in a customer s business interaction or other collaborative activity caused or allegedly caused in the future by our products and services could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
although we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  there can be no assurance that existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
we could be subjected to legal actions based upon the content we obtain from third parties over whom we exert limited control 
it is possible that we could become subject to legal actions based upon claims that our course content infringes the rights of others or is erroneous 
any such claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and the diversion of our financial resources and management personnel 
the risk of such claims is exacerbated by the fact that our course content is provided by third parties over whom we exert limited control 
further  if those claims are successful  we may be required to alter the content  pay financial damages or obtain content from others 
risks related to the operation of our business some of our international subsidiaries have not complied with regulatory requirements relating to their financial statements and tax returns 
we operate our business in various foreign countries through subsidiaries organized in those countries 
due to our restatement of the historical smartforce financial statements  some of our subsidiaries have not filed their audited statutory financial statements and have been delayed in filing their tax returns in their respective jurisdictions 
as a result  some of these foreign subsidiaries may be subject to regulatory restrictions  penalties and fines and additional taxes 
we have experienced net losses in the past  and we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability 
smartforce incurred substantial net losses prior to the merger  including net losses of million in the six months ended june  skillsoft corporation incurred substantial net losses in every fiscal quarter prior to its fiscal quarter ended january  in addition  the combined company recorded a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended january  and million for the fiscal year ended january  we achieved profitability for the first time post merger in the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended january  however  we incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year and cannot guarantee that our combined business will achieve or sustain profitability in any future period 

table of contents our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
this limits your ability to evaluate historical financial results and increases the likelihood that our results will fall below market analysts expectations  which could cause the price of our adss to drop rapidly and severely 
we have in the past experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  and we anticipate that these fluctuations will continue 
as a result  we believe that our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future 
if in some future quarters our results of operations are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  this could have a severe adverse effect on the market price of our adss 
our operating results have historically fluctuated  and our operating results may in the future continue to fluctuate  as a result of factors  which include without limitation the size and timing of new renewal agreements and upgrades  royalty rates  the announcement  introduction and acceptance of new products  product enhancements and technologies by us and our competitors  the mix of sales between our field sales force  our other direct sales channels and our telesales channels  general conditions in the us or the international economy  the loss of significant customers  delays in availability of new products  product or service quality problems  seasonality due to the budget and purchasing cycles of our customers  we expect our revenue and operating results will generally be strongest in the second half of our fiscal year and weakest in the first half of our fiscal year  the spending patterns of our customers  litigation costs and expenses  including the costs related to the restatement of the smartforce financial statements  non recurring charges related to acquisitions  growing competition that may result in price reductions  and currency fluctuations 
most of our expenses  such as rent and most employee compensation  do not vary directly with revenue and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
any such revenue shortfall would  therefore  have a disproportionate effect on our expected operating results for that quarter 
demand for our products and services may be especially susceptible to adverse economic conditions 
our business and financial performance may be damaged by adverse financial conditions affecting our target customers or by a general weakening of the economy 
companies may not view training products and services as critical to the success of their businesses 
if these companies experience disappointing operating results  whether as a result of adverse economic conditions  competitive issues or other factors  they may decrease or forego education and training expenditures before limiting their other expenditures or in conjunction with lowering other expenses 

table of contents increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our products and services  which may result in reduced revenues and gross profits and loss of market share 
the market for corporate education and training solutions is highly fragmented and competitive 
we expect the market to become increasingly competitive due to the lack of significant barriers to entry 
in addition to increased competition from new companies entering into the market  established companies are entering into the market through acquisitions of smaller companies  which directly compete with us  and this trend is expected to continue 
we may also face competition from publishing companies and vendors of application software  including those vendors with whom we have formed development and marketing alliances 
our primary sources of direct competition are third party suppliers of instructor led information technology  business  management and professional skills education and training  suppliers of computer based training and e learning solutions  internal education and training departments of potential customers  and value added resellers and network integrators 
growing competition may result in price reductions  reduced revenue and gross profits and loss of market share  any one of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition  and we expect to face increasing price pressures from competitors as managers demand more value for their training budgets 
accordingly  we may be unable to provide e learning solutions that compare favorably with new instructor led techniques  other interactive training software or new e learning solutions 
we rely on a limited number of third parties to provide us with educational content for our courses and referenceware  and our alliances with these third parties may be terminated or fail to meet our requirements 
we rely on a limited number of independent third parties to provide us with the educational content for a majority of our courses based on learning objectives and specific instructional design templates that we provide to them 
we do not have exclusive arrangements or long term contracts with any of these content providers 
if one or more of our third party content providers were to stop working with us  we would have to rely on other parties to develop our course content 
in addition  these providers may fail to develop new courses or existing courses on a timely basis 
we cannot predict whether new content or enhancements would be available from reliable alternative sources on reasonable terms 
in addition  books relies on third party publishers to provide all of the content incorporated into its referenceware products 
if one or more of these publishers were to terminate their license with us  we may not be able to find substitute publishers for such content 
in addition  we may be forced to pay increased royalties to these publishers to continue our licenses with them 
in the event that we are unable to maintain or expand our current development alliances or enter into new development alliances  our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  we will be required to pay royalties to some of our development partners on products developed with them  which could reduce our gross margins 
we expect that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors  including the revenue mix and the timing of expenses associated with development alliances 
in addition  the collaborative nature of the development process under these alliances may result in longer development times and less control over the timing of product introductions than for e learning offerings developed solely by us 
our strategic alliance partners may from time to time renegotiate the terms of their agreements with us  which could result in changes to the royalty or other arrangements  adversely affecting our results of operations 
the independent third party strategic partners we rely on for educational content and product marketing may compete with us  harming our results of operations 
our agreements with these third parties generally do 
table of contents not restrict them from developing courses on similar topics for our competitors or from competing directly with us 
as a result  our competitors may be able to duplicate some of our course content and gain a competitive advantage 
our success depends on our ability to meet the needs of the rapidly changing market 
the market for education and training software is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and preferences and frequent introductions of new products and services embodying new technologies 
new methods of providing interactive education in a technology based format are being developed and offered in the marketplace  including intranet and internet offerings 
in addition  multimedia and other product functionality features are being added to educational software 
our future success will depend upon the extent to which we are able to develop and implement products which address these emerging market requirements in a cost effective and timely basis 
product development is risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in technology  coordinate technical personnel and identify and eliminate design flaws 
any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of our products and could reduce sales of predecessor products 
we may not be successful in introducing new products on a timely basis 
in addition  new products introduced by us may fail to achieve a significant degree of market acceptance or  once accepted  may fail to sustain viability in the market for any significant period 
if we are unsuccessful in addressing the changing needs of the marketplace due to resource  technological or other constraints  or in anticipating and responding adequately to changes in customers software technology and preferences  our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
we  along with the rest of the industry  face a challenging and competitive market for it spending that has resulted in reduced contract value for our formal learning product lines 
this pricing pressure is having a negative impact on revenue for these product lines and may have a continued or increased adverse impact in the future 
the e learning market is a developing market  and our business will suffer if e learning is not widely accepted 
the market for e learning is a new and emerging market 
corporate training and education have historically been conducted primarily through classroom instruction and have traditionally been performed by a company s internal personnel 
many companies have invested heavily in their current training solutions 
although technology based training applications have been available for several years  they currently account for only a small portion of the overall training market 
accordingly  our future success will depend upon the extent to which companies adopt technology based solutions for their training activities  and the extent to which companies utilize the services or purchase products of third party providers 
many companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional methods of corporate training may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy that may compete with their existing investments 
even if companies implement technology based training or e learning solutions  they may still choose to design  develop  deliver or manage all or part of their education and training internally 
if technology based learning does not become widespread  or if companies do not use the products and services of third parties to develop  deliver or manage their training needs  then our products and service may not achieve commercial success 
the success of our e learning strategy depends on the reliability and consistent performance of our information systems and internet infrastructure 
the success of our e learning strategy is highly dependent on the consistent performance of our information systems and internet infrastructure 
if for any reason our web site fails or if it experiences any unscheduled downtimes  even for only a short period  our business and reputation could be materially harmed 
we have in the past experienced performance problems and unscheduled downtime  and these problems could recur 
we currently rely on third parties for proper functioning of computer infrastructure  delivery of our e learning applications and the performance of our destination site 
our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquake  financial 
table of contents patterns of hosting providers and similar events 
any system failures could adversely affect customer usage of our solutions and user traffic results in any future quarters  which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and harm our reputation with corporate customers  subscribers and commerce partners 
accordingly  the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our web site and computer infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain corporate customers  subscribers and commerce partners 
we cannot accurately project the rate or timing of any increases in traffic to our web site and  therefore  the integration and timing of any upgrades or enhancements required to facilitate any significant traffic increase to the web site are uncertain 
we have in the past experienced difficulties in upgrading our web site infrastructure to handle increased traffic  and these difficulties could recur 
the failure to expand and upgrade our web site or any system error  failure or extended down time could materially harm our business  reputation  financial condition or results of operations 
because many users of our e learning solutions will access them over the internet  factors adversely affecting the use of the internet or our customers networking infrastructures could harm our business 
many of our customer s users access our e learning solutions over the internet or through our customers internal networks 
any factors that adversely affect internet usage could disrupt the ability of those users to access our e learning solutions  which would adversely affect customer satisfaction and therefore our business 
for example  our ability to increase the effectiveness and scope of our services to customers is ultimately limited by the speed and reliability of both the internet and our customers internal networks 
consequently  the emergence and growth of the market for our products and services depends upon the improvements being made to the entire internet as well as to our individual customers networking infrastructures to alleviate overloading and congestion 
if these improvements are not made  and the quality of networks degrades  the ability of our customers to use our products and services will be hindered and our revenues may suffer 
additionally  a requirement for the continued growth of accessing e learning solutions over the internet is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
failure to prevent security breaches into our products or our customers networks  or well publicized security breaches affecting the internet in general could significantly harm our growth and revenue 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise of technology we use to protect content and transactions  our products or our customers proprietary information in our databases 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary and confidential information or could cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to address problems caused by security breaches 
the privacy of users may also deter people from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information 
our restructuring plans may be ineffective or may limit our ability to compete 
since the merger  we have recorded an aggregate of million in merger and exit costs and an aggregate of million of restructuring charges 
there are several risks inherent in these efforts to transition to a new cost structure 
these include the risk that we will not be successful in restoring profitability  and hence we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges and create additional risks 
in addition  there is the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and remain competitive 
each of the above measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 

table of contents we depend on a few key personnel to manage and operate the business and must be able to attract and retain highly qualified employees 
our success is largely dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of our key executives and senior management 
failure to retain these executives  or the loss of certain senior management personnel or other key employees  could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects 
we are also dependent on the continued service of our key sales  content development and operational personnel and on our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
in addition  we depend on writers  programmers  web designers and graphic artists 
we may be unsuccessful in attracting  training  retaining or motivating key personnel 
in particular  the negative consequences including litigation of having to restate smartforce s historical financial statements  uncertainties surrounding the merger  and our recent adverse operating results and stock price performance could create uncertainties that materially and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the inability to hire  train and retain qualified personnel or the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business  new product development efforts and future business prospects 
changes in accounting standards regarding stock option plans could limit the desirability of granting stock options  which could harm our ability to attract and retain employees  and could also reduce our profitability 
the financial accounting standards board has determined to require all companies to treat the value of stock options granted to employees as an expense commencing in our third quarter of fiscal this change will require companies to record a compensation expense equal to the value of each stock option granted 
this expense will be spread over the vesting period of the stock option 
due to the fact that we will be required to expense stock option grants  it could reduce the attractiveness of granting stock options because the additional expense associated with these grants would reduce our profitability 
however  stock options are an important employee recruitment and retention tool  and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we reduce the scope of our employee stock option program 
accordingly  either our profitability  or our ability to use stock options as an employee recruitment and retention tool would be adversely impacted 
our business is subject to currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our operating results 
due to our multinational operations  our operating results are subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which revenues are collected or expenses are paid 
in particular  the value of the us dollar against the euro and related currencies will impact our operating results 
our expenses will not necessarily be incurred in the currency in which revenue is generated  and  as a result  we will be required from time to time to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
these currency conversions are subject to exchange rate fluctuations  and changes to the value of the euro  pound sterling and other currencies relative to the us dollar could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of products or services that compete with ours 
our success depends to a degree upon the protection of our rights in intellectual property 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright  and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we have also entered into  and will continue to enter into  confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties to seek to limit and protect the distribution of confidential information 
however  we have not signed protective agreements in every case 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary rights  these steps may be inadequate 
existing patent  copyright  and trademark laws offer only limited protection 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property

factors that contribute to our long sales cycle  include our need to educate potential customers about the benefits of our products  competitive evaluations by customers  the customers internal budgeting and approval processes  the fact that many customers view training products as discretionary spending  rather than purchases essential to their business  and the fact that we target large companies  which often take longer to make purchasing decisions due to the size and complexity of the enterprise

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk our general investing policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and to ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we currently use a registered investment manager to place our investments in highly liquid money market accounts and government backed securities 
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
based on the short term nature of our investments  we have concluded that there is no significant market risk exposure 
foreign currency risk due to our multinational operations  our business is subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues or pay expenses and the us dollar 
our expenses are not necessarily incurred in the currency in which revenue is generated  and  as a result  we are required from time to time to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
these currency conversions are subject to exchange rate fluctuations  in particular changes to the value of the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar  new zealand dollar  singapore dollar  and pound sterling relative to the us dollar  which could adversely affect our business and the results of operations
