table of contents general cable analyzes its worldwide operations in two geographic groups north america and international 
the following table sets forth net sales and operating income by geographic group for the periods presented  in millions of dollars year ended december  amount amount amount net sales north america international total net sales operating income loss north america international subtotal corporate and other operating items total operating income approximately of net sales in the company s international operations are derived from energy and industrial specialty cable sales and the european business specifically is currently benefiting from medium voltage energy cable capacity shortage in europe and a shift towards environmentally friendly cables 
general cable s reported net sales are directly influenced by the price of copper  and to a lesser extent  aluminum 
the price of copper and aluminum has historically been subject to considerable volatility 
the daily selling price of copper cathode on the comex averaged per pound in  per pound in and per pound in and the daily price of aluminum rod averaged per pound in  per pound in and per pound in general cable generally passes changes in copper and aluminum prices along to its customers  although there are timing delays of varying lengths depending upon the volatility of metals prices  the type of product  competitive conditions and particular customer arrangements 
a significant portion of the company s energy and communications business and  to a lesser extent  the company s industrial business has metal escalators written into customer contracts under a variety of price setting and recovery formulas 
the remainder of the company s business requires that the cost of higher metal prices be recovered through negotiated price increases with customers 
in these instances  the ability to increase the company s selling prices may lag the movement in metal prices by a period of time as the customer price increases are implemented 
as a result of this and a number of other practices intended to match copper and aluminum purchases with sales  profitability over time has historically not been significantly affected by changes in copper and aluminum prices 
general cable does not engage in speculative metals trading or other speculative activities 
also  the company does not engage in activities to hedge the underlying value of its copper and aluminum inventory 
the company is also experiencing significant inflationary pressure on raw materials other than copper and aluminum used in cable manufacturing  such as insulating compounds  steel and wood reels  and higher energy costs 
the company has increased selling prices in most of its markets in order to offset the negative effect of increased raw material prices and other costs 
however  the company s ability to ultimately realize these price increases will be influenced by competitive conditions in its markets  which includes underutilized manufacturing capacity 
in addition  a continuing rise in raw material prices  when combined with the normal lag time between an announced customer price increase and its effective date in the market  may result in the company not fully recovering these increased costs 
if the company was not able to adequately increase selling prices in a period of rising raw material costs  the company would experience a decrease in reported earnings 
general cable generally has experienced and expects to continue to experience certain seasonal trends in sales and cash flow 
larger amounts of cash are generally required during the first and second quarters of the year to build inventories in anticipation of higher demand during the spring and summer months  when construction activity increases 
in general  receivables related to higher sales activity during the spring and summer months are collected during the fourth quarter of the year 

table of contents current business environment in north america  general cable has been operating for some time in a difficult business environment 
the wire and cable industry is competitive  mature and cost driven 
in many business segments  there is little differentiation among industry participants from a manufacturing or technology standpoint 
during  the company s end markets have shown signs of recovery 
there has been significant merger and acquisition activity which  we believe  may lead to a reduction in the deployment of inefficient  high cost capacity in the industry 
in the energy segment  the power outages in the us  canada and europe emphasized a need to upgrade the power transmission infrastructure used by electric utilities  which may  over time  cause an increase in demand for general cable s energy products 
in addition  tax legislation was recently passed in the united states which includes the renewal of tax credits for producing power from wind 
this may also cause an increase in demand for the company s products as the company is a significant manufacturer of wire and cable used in wind farms 
in the industrial specialty segment industrial construction spending in north america  which influences industrial cable demand  is significantly below the peak levels experienced over the last ten years 
however  the company has seen strengthening demand which may indicate a turnaround in industrial construction spending in north america 
this segment has also experienced increased demand for cables utilized in industrial repairs and maintenance and the automotive aftermarket 
over the last two years  the communications segment also has experienced a significant decline from historical spending levels for outside plant telecommunications products and a weak market for switching local area networking cables 
demand for communications wire and cable products has improved over the last several quarters and the company believes it will benefit from the consolidation of competitors which occurred early this year in the communications market 
the company anticipates  based on recent regulatory announcements  further deployment of fiber optic products into the telephone network 
increased spending by the telephone companies on fiber deployment may negatively impact their purchases of the company s copper based telecommunications cable products 
however  this impact may be somewhat mitigated in that the company believes it will benefit from the further investment in fiber broadband networks as its customers will most likely need to upgrade a portion of their copper network to support the fiber network 
additionally  the company participates in the fiber cable market 
general cable believes its investment in lean six sigma training  coupled with effectively utilized manufacturing assets  provides a cost advantage compared to many of its competitors and generates cost savings which help offset rising raw material prices and other general economic cost increases 
in addition  general cable s customer and supplier integration capabilities  one stop selling and geographic and product balance are sources of competitive advantage 
as a result  the company believes it is well positioned  relative to its competitors  in the current business environment 
as part of general cable s ongoing efforts to reduce total operating costs  the company continuously evaluates its ability to more efficiently utilize existing manufacturing capacity 
such evaluation includes the costs associated with and benefits to be derived from the combination of existing manufacturing assets into fewer plant locations and the possible outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes 
in  the company announced the rationalization and refocusing of operations of certain of its industrial cable manufacturing plants which resulted in a million charge in the fourth quarter of of which approximately million were cash payments and a million charge in of which approximately million were cash payments 
during  the company also closed its rod mill operation and sold certain equipment utilized in that operation which resulted in a net gain of million 
acquisitions and divestitures general cable actively seeks to identify key trends in the industry to migrate its business to capitalize on expanding markets and new niche markets or exit declining or non strategic markets in order to achieve better returns 
the company also sets aggressive performance targets for its business and intends to refocus or divest those activities which fail to meet targets or do not fit long term strategies 
during the second quarter of  general cable formed a joint venture company to manufacture and market fiber optic cables 
general cable contributed assets  primarily inventory and machinery and equipment  to a subsidiary company which was then contributed to the joint venture in exchange for a million note receivable which resulted in a million deferred gain on the transaction 
the december  balance sheets included a million note receivable from the joint venture partner in other non current assets and a deferred gain from the initial joint venture formation of million in other liabilities 
in january  the company reduced its ownership percentage in the joint venture from to and as a result the deferred gain was reduced to million 
beginning in the first quarter of the company consolidated the joint venture company as a result of the adoption of fasb interpretation fin no 
 as revised  consolidation of variable interest entities 
for  the joint venture had sales of million  an operating loss of million and net loss of million 
prior to the first quarter of  the joint venture company was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
at december   other non current assets included an investment in the joint venture of million 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  the company exchanged the note receivable from the former joint venture partner for the partner s ownership interest in the joint venture company 
the ownership interest acquired was recorded at fair value which was million less than the carrying value of the note receivable  net of the deferred gain  which resulted in a million charge 
as a result of this transaction  general cable owned of the fiber optic joint venture company at december  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a summary of significant accounting policies is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of these policies requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  information that is available to management about current events and actions the company may take in the future and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most critical judgments impacting the financial statements include determinations with respect to inventory costing and valuation  pension accounting  the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes and revenue recognition which are discussed below 
in addition  significant estimates and judgments are also involved in the valuation allowances for sales incentives and accounts receivable  legal  environmental  asbestos and customer reel deposit liabilities  assets and obligations related to other post retirement benefits  and self insured workers compensation and health insurance reserves 
management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates used in the application of its accounting policies and adjusts amounts in the financial statements as necessary 
inventory costing and valuation general cable utilizes the lifo method of inventory accounting for its metals inventory 
the company s use of the lifo method results in its income statement reflecting the current costs of metals  while metals inventories in the balance sheet are valued at historical costs as the lifo layers were created 
as a result of volatile copper prices  the replacement cost of the company s copper inventory exceeded the historic lifo cost by approximately million at december  and by approximately million at december  if lifo inventory quantities are reduced in a period when replacement costs exceed the lifo value of the inventory  the company would experience an increase in reported earnings 
conversely  if lifo inventory quantities are reduced in a period when replacement costs are lower than the lifo value of the inventory  the company would experience a decline in reported earnings 
if the company was not able to recover the lifo value of its inventory at a profit in some future period when replacement costs were lower than the lifo value of the inventory  the company would be required to take a charge to recognize in its income statement all or a portion of the higher lifo value of the inventory 
the company periodically evaluates the realizability of its inventory 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed to be technologically obsolete or not saleable due to condition or where inventory costs exceeds net realizable value  the company records a charge to cost of goods sold and reduces the inventory to its net realizable value 
pension accounting pension expense for the defined benefit pension plans sponsored by general cable is determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on assets of 
this assumption was based on input from actuaries  including their review of historical year  year  and year rates of inflation and real rates of return on various broad equity and bond indices in conjunction with the diversification of the asset portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of allocated to equity investments  with an expected real rate of return of  and to fixed income investments  with an expected real rate of return of  and an assumed long term rate of inflation of 
because of market fluctuations  the actual asset allocations as of december  and december  were and  respectively  of equity investments and and  respectively  of fixed income investments 
management believes that long term asset allocations on average will approximate the company s assumptions and that an long term rate of return is a reasonable assumption 
the determination of pension expense for the defined benefit pension plans is based on the fair market value of assets as of the measurement date 
investment gains and losses are recognized in the measurement of assets immediately 
such gains and losses will be amortized and recognized as part of the annual benefit cost to the extent that unrecognized net gains and losses from all sources exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of assets 
the determination of future pension obligations utilizes a discount rate based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency which are expected to be available during the period to 
table of contents maturity of the projected pension benefit obligations  and input from our actuaries 
the discount rate used at december  was 
general cable evaluates its actuarial assumptions at least annually  and adjusts them as necessary 
in  pension expense for the company s defined benefit plans was million 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of a discount rate of and various other assumptions  the company estimates its pension expense for its defined benefit plans will decrease approximately million from  primarily due to improved investment performance during a decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million 
future pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans 
in the event that actual results differ from the actuarial assumptions  the funded status of the defined benefit plans may change and any such change could result in a charge or credit to equity and an increase or decrease in future pension expense and cash contributions 
deferred income tax valuation allowance general cable records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation of the deferred tax asset is dependent on  among other things  the ability of the company to generate a sufficient level of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  the company has considered both positive and negative evidence  such as historical results of operations  including the losses realized in recent periods  and has considered the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
approximately million of this deferred tax asset must be utilized prior to its expiration in the period the remainder of the asset may be used for at least years 
this finite life has also been considered by the company in the valuation of the asset 
the company has and will continue to review on a quarterly basis its assumptions and tax planning strategies and  if the amount of the estimated realizable net deferred tax asset is less than the amount currently on the balance sheet  the company would reduce its deferred tax asset  recognizing a non cash charge against reported earnings 
at december   the company had recorded a net deferred tax asset of million million current and million long term 
at december   the company concluded that  more likely than not  the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to the customer  title and risk of loss are transferred  pricing is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
most revenue transactions represent sales of inventory 
a provision for payment discounts  product returns and customer rebates is estimated based upon historical experience and other relevant factors and is recorded within the same period that the revenue is recognized 
given the nature of the company s business  revenue recognition practices do not contain estimates that materially affect results of operations
