item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to competitive factors and other factors discussed under certain risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of digital video storage  management and streaming systems  which automate the distribution of video content  such as movies  television programs  games  and advertising 
we have three reportable segments broadband systems  broadcast systems and services 
the broadband systems segment includes products  such as our digital advertising and video on demand products that digitally manage  store and distribute digital video for cable system operators and telecommunications companies 
the broadcast systems segment includes products for the storage  archival  on air playback of advertising and other video programming for the broadcast television industry 
our system revenues are comprised of sales of our broadband and broadcast systems 
the services segment is comprised of revenue related to software development  installation  training  project management  product maintenance and technical support for all of the above systems  and delivery of movie content services 
we have experienced fluctuations in our systems revenues from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the receipt of customer orders and the shipment of those orders 
the factors that impact the timing of the receipt of customer orders include among other factors the customer s receipt of authorized signatures on their purchase orders  the budgetary approvals within the customer s company for capital purchases  and the ability to process the purchase order within the customer s organization in a timely manner 
factors that may impact the shipment of customer orders include the availability of material to produce the product  the time required to produce and test the system before delivery  and the customer s required delivery date 
the delay in the timing of receipt and shipment of any one customer order can result in significant fluctuations in our revenue reported on a quarterly basis 
our operating results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products sold and services provided  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
we price our products and services based upon our costs as well as in consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
the costs of our products primarily consist of the costs of components and subassemblies that have generally declined from product introduction to product maturity 
as a result of the growth of our business  our operating expenses have historically increased in the areas of research and development  selling and marketing  customer service and support and administration 
in the current state of the economy  we currently expect that our broadband and broadcast customers may still have limited capital spending budgets as we believe they are dependent on advertising revenues to fund their capital equipment purchases 
accordingly  we expect our financial results to vary from quarter to quarter and our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
our ability to continue to generate revenues within the markets that our products are sold and to generate cash from operations and net income is dependent on several factors which include market acceptance of the products and services offered by our customers and increased subscriber usage and demand for these products and services  selection by our customers of our products and services versus the products and services being offered by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products to the market in a timely manner and to meet the demands of the market for new products and product enhancements  our ability to maintain gross margins from the sale of our products and services at a level that will provide us with cash to fund our operations given the pricing pressures within the market and the costs of materials to manufacture our products  and our ability to control operating costs given the fluctuations that we have experienced with revenues from quarter to quarter 
in fiscal our total revenues grew to million compared to growth in fiscal the continued growth in revenues is primarily attributed to the increase in services revenues which grew by to million in fiscal as compared to growth in fiscal this sustained services revenue growth is primarily attributed to providing technical support and maintenance services to an ever expanding base of equipment installed at customer sites 
systems revenues increased by to million in fiscal compared to growth in fiscal the systems revenue growth in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher revenues from video on demand product sales  million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  and broadcast product sales  million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase in video on demand systems revenues reflects the expanding deployment of residential video on demand systems by broadband operators throughout the united states of america and the start of deployments in europe and asia 
we experienced a significant decline in product revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the first three quarters of fiscal the decline in revenues in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to a decline in video on demand revenues due to unanticipated delays in the order receipt  shipment and acceptance of certain orders 
we expect video on demand systems revenues will increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal  depending upon customers continued acceptance of these systems in key regional domestic markets and their initial deployment throughout asia and europe during fiscal we expect sales of broadcast systems to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal our advertising systems revenues declined by to million in fiscal compared to a decrease of in fiscal offset the revenues growth in the video on demand and broadcast systems revenues 
we believe the decrease in advertising systems revenues reflects a decline in demand for analog advertisement systems from cable operators as they migrate from an analog to digital network environment 
also  the decline in advertising systems revenues is attributed to the continued adverse affects from the economic slowdown in the advertising industry 
we expect sales for both analog and digital advertising systems to grow modestly in fiscal gross profits increased percentage points to in fiscal over the same period in fiscal in comparison to a percentage point increase in fiscal over the same period in fiscal higher revenues and lower manufacturing and material costs per unit primarily contributed to this favorable performance  even though competitive pressures resulted in lower average selling prices per unit in fiscal in addition  gross margins were favorably impacted by the million adjustment to product revenue recorded related to the final agreement with comcast see note to financial statements in connection with the issuance of incentive common stock warrants 
our services gross profit was in fiscal compared to in fiscal  reflecting higher revenues on a relatively fixed cost structure 
we believe that competitive pressures will continue and our ability to maintain gross margins will be dependent upon maintaining current levels of revenues and achieving technological advances that will further reduce material costs of sales 
our revenue growth and improving gross margin resulted in net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal as compared to net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal for fiscal as compared to fiscal  this improvement in operating results  combined with successful working capital management  enabled us to generate million of cash from operations 
we believe there are significant uncertainties about our ability to be profitable in fiscal these uncertainties include the timing and magnitude of orders from new customers located primarily outside the united states and a recent decline in orders from our largest customer who has represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal and fiscal in addition  there continues to be pricing pressures from our competitors across all our product lines 
revenues for fiscal year are also dependent upon the timely introduction and customer acceptance of new products within each of our product families 
acquisition in may  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of zq interactive  ltd  a company incorporated in the british virgin islands with its principal office in shanghai  china  for million in cash and a note payable 
accordingly  the financial position and results of operations of zq interactive have been consolidated subsequent to the acquisition date  the impact of this consolidation has not been material to our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
for discussion of the accounting treatment of the transaction  see note of the accompanying financial statements 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  and if different estimates that could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounting related to revenue recognition is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
revenues from sales of systems and software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
installation  training  and project management revenue is deferred and recognized as these services are performed 
revenue from product maintenance and technical support is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements 
customers are billed for installation  training  project management  training  product maintenance and technical support at the time of the product sale 
if a portion of the sales price is not due until installation of the system is complete  that portion of the sales price is deferred until installation is complete 
revenue from movie content services is recognized based on the volume of monthly purchases that are made by hotel guests 
revenue from product development services is recognized based on the efforts expended in relation to the overall expected efforts for the project 
shipping and handling costs and service expenses reimbursed by customers are included in revenue and cost of revenues 
our transactions frequently involve the sales of systems and software and services under multiple element arrangements 
systems sales always include at least one year of free product maintenance and technical support services 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to all undelivered elements of the sales arrangement based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amounts allocated to project management  training  technical support and maintenance and movie content fees are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation and product management revenue is based upon standard hourly billing rates and the estimated time required to complete the service 
the amount allocated to the sale of systems and software reflects the residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to the undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to the delivered elements 
installation  project management  and training services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
for multiple element arrangements that include software licenses and services where vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value does not exist to allocate a portion of the fee to the undelivered element  and the only undelivered element is services  the entire fee under the multiple element arrangement is recognized as services are performed 
for transactions in which consideration  including equity instruments  is given to a customer  we account for the value of this consideration as a reduction in revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the fair value for each element 
we recognize revenue for systems and software and services only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable 
our normal payment terms are of the order due upon receipt of a customer purchase order  due upon shipment of the product to the customer and due days after shipment of the product to the customer 
our finance management regularly monitors payments from our customers and assesses any collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customer s financial condition but generally do not require collateral 
for some of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
we maintain allowances for specific doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and record these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit assessments  and other analysis of specific customer situations 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  additional allowances may be required or established allowances may be considered unnecessary 
for example  in the fiscal year ended january   we increased our accounts receivable reserves by  as a provision against outstanding amounts owed by adelphia communications corp  which filed for bankruptcy in june in the fiscal year ended january   we reversed  of this provision as a result of events that took place during the year related to adelphia s announcement of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy and our ability to sell the adelphia receivables to a third party 
judgment is required in making these determinations and our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in fiscal  we entered into a video on demand purchase agreement and a common stock and warrant purchase agreement with comcast corporation comcast 
as part of these agreements  comcast was issued common stock and earned incentive common stock purchase warrants based on the number of cable subscribers being served by our equipment which had been purchased by comcast 
we determined the fair value of the common stock and the incentive common stock purchase warrants using the black scholes valuation method and amortized this fair value as an offset to gross revenue in proportion to the revenue recognized from the sale of the equipment to comcast 
the assumptions used in this valuation included a weighted average volatility factor  a dividend yield  a risk free interest rate and an expected warrant term 
if management had used another valuation method or different valuation assumptions  the fair value of the common stock and the warrants may have significantly changed  which could have materially impacted our results of operations 
during the year ended january   comcast earned the remaining common stock purchase warrants available under the agreement 
in october  we issued comcast the remaining  incentive common stock purchase warrants 
the original estimate of the value of the warrants was based on management s determination that comcast earned the incentive common stock warrants when our vod equipment was delivered to comcast and we recorded the revenue 
we agreed to revise the number of incentive common stock purchase warrants to be issued at each of the determination dates defined above when we reached a final agreement with comcast on when the warrants were earned 
as a result of the adjustment  we determined that the estimated fair market value of the incentive common stock purchase warrants was lower than the amount previously recorded  which resulted in a million reduction in the accrual estimate with an offsetting increase in product revenues in the accompanying statement of operations for the fiscal year ended january  inventories and reserves for obsolescence 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of components  subassemblies and finished products held for sale 
all of our hardware components are purchased from outside vendors 
we depend upon certain vendors for the manufacture of significant components for all of our products 
if these vendors were to become unwilling or unable to manufacture these products in required volumes  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable alternative vendors 
the inability to develop alternative sources  if required in the future  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing  finance and operations personnel monitor quarterly the inventories to determine that the carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we record a provision for net realizable value adjustments  including obsolete inventory  when an impairment is identified through the quarterly management review process 
obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand components  subassemblies and finished products  is written down to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost 
the obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions and estimates about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments 
in the fiscal year ended january   we recorded additional inventory reserve provisions of  primarily related to management s termination of certain product development initiatives 
for inventory that has been written down to its net realizable value  we release the reserve upon sale or disposal of this inventory 
investments in affiliates 
we consolidate the balance sheets and results of operations of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we also hold minority investments in the capital stock of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that are strategic to us 
these investments in affiliates include equity investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method of accounting 
under the cost method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the equity shares of the affiliate  the investments are carried at cost in order to determine whether any other than temporary loss should be recorded 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the equity securities of the affiliate  our proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate is included in equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether an investment is more accurately reflected using the cost or equity method 
we review the fair value of our investments in affiliates on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest a decline in the value of the asset 
the carrying value of our investments in affiliates may be affected by the affiliate s ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans  general market conditions  industry considerations specific to the affiliate s business  and other factors 
the inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods affected by those events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result in equity losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
we evaluate our relationships with our equity and debt investments to determine whether the guidelines of fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised under fin r should be applied in our financial statements 
fin no 
r addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
a variable interest entity vie is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the financial position and results of the vie 
with the adoption of fin r in the first quarter of fiscal and our subsequent assessments of new investments during fiscal  we concluded that finr had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for acquisitions 
we have completed business acquisitions which have resulted in goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our business strategy contemplates that we may continue to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
our accounting for acquisitions involves judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the fair values of certain forms of consideration  acquired intangible assets which may involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  tangible acquired assets  assumed liabilities and potential contingencies  and the useful lives of acquired assets 
the values we record for goodwill and other intangible assets represent fair values calculated by primarily using a discounted cash flow valuation method 
such valuations depend upon significant estimates and assumptions that are derived from information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and our business plans for the acquired businesses or intellectual property 
these estimates and assumptions used in the initial valuation of goodwill and intangible assets include  but are not limited to i future expected cash flows from product sales  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  ii expected costs to complete any in process research and development projects and commercialize viable products and estimated cash flows from sales of such products  iii the acquired companies brand awareness and market position  iv assumptions about the period of time over which we will continue to use the acquired products or services  and v discount rates 
these estimates and assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate because unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
if estimates and assumptions used to initially value goodwill and intangible assets prove to be inaccurate  ongoing reviews of the carrying values of such goodwill and intangible assets  as discussed below  may indicate impairment which will require us to record an impairment charge in the period in which we identify the impairment 
changes in assumptions and estimates related to acquisitions could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets 
we review on a regular basis the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external  that may suggest an asset is not recoverable that is  the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the asset s use and eventual disposition 
factors we consider important that could trigger the impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  significant adverse change to the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in our technological value as compared to the market  and a reduction in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
our cash flow projections contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income tax expense benefit  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to indications that they may not be fully realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating sufficient pre tax income in future periods 
as of january   we continued to record a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets primarily due to the uncertainties related to our ability to continue to generate pre tax income for fiscal and thereafter 
even though we generated pre tax income during five of the last six fiscal quarters  we assessed the need for the valuation allowance as of january  based on all available evidence 
we believe there are significant uncertainties about our ability to be profitable in fiscal these uncertainties include the timing and magnitude of orders from new customers located primarily outside the united states and a recent decline in orders from our largest customer who has represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal and fiscal in addition  there continues to be pricing pressures from our competitors across all our product lines 
revenues for fiscal year are also dependent upon the timely introduction and customer acceptance of new products within each of our product families 
we expect to obtain and evaluate additional information available in fiscal that may provide sufficient evidence for us to conclude that the valuation reserve can be reversed in fiscal this additional information includes capital spending plans from us cable operators for calendar for both advertising and vod systems  specific capital spending plans from our largest customer  price per stream information for expected vod purchases which has continued to decline over the past two fiscal years  capital spending plans from new customers in europe and asia that we currently expect will become a large portion of our total revenues in fiscal and by continued requirements to invest in new product development and customer support services of our products world wide 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we established reserves for tax contingencies that reflect our best estimate of the transactions and deductions that we may be unable to sustain or that we could be willing to concede as part of a broader tax settlement 
we are subject to undergoing routine tax examinations by federal and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
tax authorities periodically challenge certain transactions and deductions we reported on our income tax returns 
we do not expect the outcome of these examinations  either individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
accounting for contingencies 
we are subject to certain claims and litigation including proceedings under government laws and regulations and commercial disputes relating to our operations  including ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business 
we review and determine which liabilities  if any arising from these claims and litigations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
loss contingency liabilities are recorded for these contingencies based on careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside counsel when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
these liabilities may change in the future due to new developments relating to each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy 
in the fiscal year ended january   we recorded charges of million associated with an unfavorable jury verdict in connection with the litigation with ncube 
we believe that our reserve of million at january  related to this litigation is our best estimate of our exposure based on information currently available 
we believe that any liability ultimately incurred after pursuing all legal options will not likely exceed this reserve  except for on going legal fees associated with the dispute and additional interest on the awarded damages  which will be charged to operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital or incurring debt 
other than our equity investment in odg see liquidity and capital resources  we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january systems revenues 
our systems revenues consist of sales of our broadband and broadcast products 
systems revenues increased from million in the fiscal year ended january  to million in the fiscal year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal advertising system revenues were million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  video on demand systems revenues increased to million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  revenues from video on demand systems for the fiscal year ended january  were increased by million for the adjustment recorded in connection with the final agreement with comcast see note to financial statements concerning incentive common stock purchase warrants 
revenues from video on demand systems for the fiscal year ended january  were reduced by the amortization of million  related to the deferred equity discount associated with the comcast equity investment 
the decrease in broadband revenues is primarily attributable a decline in the number of expansion systems purchased by united states cable system operators for advertising insertion offset in part by increased deployment of residential video on demand systems in the united states by cable operators 
we experienced a significant decline in revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the first three quarters of fiscal the decline in revenues in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to a decline in video on demand revenues due to unanticipated delays in the order receipt  shipment and acceptance of certain orders 
in addition  during fiscal  our video on demand prices decreased approximately from the prior fiscal year 
however  the effect on our systems gross profit as a result of this video on demand price decrease was offset by a reduction in material costs on certain components and other technological advancements 
broadcast system segment revenues were million in the fiscal year ended january  compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in broadcast revenues for the fiscal year ended january  was primarily attributable to capital purchases by broadcast companies in asia 
we expect future revenue growth  if any  to come principally from our broadband and broadcast system products as cable and telecommunications companies continue to offer new applications for their customers and the market for digital video servers within the broadcast industry continues to expand 
as revenues from broadcast and interactive television products increase  the advertising products will become a smaller portion of total system revenues 
however  we believe that there will be a continuing demand for expansions to existing advertising insertion systems within the united states and increasing demand for advertising insertion systems in an on demand environment as video on demand becomes more available to subscribers 
services revenues 
our services revenues consist of fees for installation  training  project management  product maintenance  technical support services  product development contracts and movie content fees 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the annual renewals of product maintenance and technical support service contracts  price increases on certain technical support and maintenance services and the impact of a growing installed base of systems 
revenues from our wholly owned subsidiary  digital video arts  increased from million in the fiscal year ended january  to million in the fiscal year ended january  revenues from services are expected to continue to grow as the installed base of our products increases and revenues from digital video arts continue to grow due to additional development contracts and new product offerings 
for the years ended january  and january   certain customers each accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers each accounted for and of total revenues in the year ended january  and of total revenues in the year ended january  revenue from these customers was primarily in the broadband segment 
we believe that a significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended january  and january   respectively 
the increase in international revenues in fiscal was primarily due to the initial deployments of residential video on demand systems in both europe and asia 
no individual country except the us accounted for more than of total revenue 
we expect that international sales will become a more significant portion of our business in the future  especially in the new video on demand markets in europe and asia during fiscal year as of january   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
therefore  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
systems gross profit 
costs of systems revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased components and subassemblies  labor and overhead relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems and related expenses 
costs of systems revenues decreased to million in the year ended january  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended january  in the fiscal year ended january   the decrease in the costs of systems revenues primarily reflects higher systems revenues within the video on demand and broadcast products offset by lower material costs on video on demand and advertising products 
our ability to maintain or improve our current gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues will be impacted by competitive price pressures which may result in lower average selling prices in fiscal systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was and in the fiscal years ended january  and january   respectively 
gross profit for the broadband segment increased from of revenues for the fiscal year ended january  to of revenues for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in broadband gross profit percentages is primarily due to higher video on demand systems revenues and lower material costs on certain components for video on demand systems due to technological advances and the adjustment related to the issuance of the incentive common stock purchase warrants to comcast see note to the financial statements offset in part by a decrease in video on demand prices of approximately 
gross profit for the broadcast segment was flat for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
systems gross profit for fiscal year was negatively impacted by the significant decline in systems revenues in the fourth quarter primarily resulting from a decline in video on demand revenues due to unanticipated delays in the order receipt  shipment and acceptance of certain orders 
services gross profit 
costs of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support and software development services provided by us and costs associated with providing movie content services 
costs of services revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january   primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel to support the growing installed base of customers throughout the world 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue was in the year ended january  and in the year ended january  the increase in services gross profit was primarily a result of higher revenues on a relatively fixed cost structure 
we expect to experience fluctuations in gross profit percentage in the future due to the timing of revenues from product development and technical support and other services to support the growing installed base of systems and the timing of costs associated with our ongoing investment required to continue to expand our service organization to support our installed base of systems and our new products 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  primarily due to the hiring of additional development engineers to support new product initiatives 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase approximately to in fiscal year compared to our results in fiscal year as we continue our development of new products and enhancements 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  this increase is primarily due to increased sales commissions on higher revenues and higher travel costs related to increased direct sales efforts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the compensation of executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
in the fiscal year ended january   general and administrative expenses of million  or of total revenues  included the recovery of  of the  provision recorded in the fiscal year ended january  for outstanding amounts owed by adelphia as a result of events that took place during fiscal related to adelphia s announcement of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy and our ability to sell the adelphia receivables to a third party 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended january  of million  or of total revenues  were  higher than the fiscal year ended january  due to higher accounting and consulting fees associated with the compliance with sarbanes oxley legislation and higher legal costs related to the ncube litigation see note to the accompanying financial statements 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended january  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a  reduction to interest income  net of taxes and other comprehensive loss to properly account for the amortization of market premiums and discounts on acquired marketable securities since december we determined that the impact of the correction was not material to any historical reporting period 
interest expense was  in the fiscal year ended january  and  in the fiscal year ended january  equity income loss in earnings of affiliates 
equity income in earning of affiliates was  in the fiscal year ended january  and equity loss in earnings of affiliates was  in the fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january  and  the equity income loss in earnings of affiliates consists of our proportionate ownership share of the earnings of on demand group limited odg under the equity method of accounting 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
income tax expense for fiscal year included a million benefit primarily related to the implementation of a tax law change relating to the tax treatment of deferred revenues which resulted in the realization of an associated deferred tax asset and a corresponding valuation allowance release as seachange began to follow the same method for both book and tax purposes for recognizing revenue for maintenance service contracts 
seachange had an effective income tax rate of for the year ended january  before recording the adjustment discussed above 
for the year ended january   the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the utilization of the company s remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards 
as of january   we continued to record a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets primarily due to the uncertainties related to our ability to continue to generate pre tax income for fiscal and thereafter 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
if we determine that we can continue to generate sufficient future pre tax income  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be recognized fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january systems revenues 
systems revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in the year ended january  and of total revenues in the year ended january  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal advertising system revenues were million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  video on demand systems revenues increased to million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  revenues from video on demand systems for the years ended january  and were reduced by the amortization of and million  respectively  related to the deferred equity discount associated with the comcast equity investment 
the increase in broadband revenues is primarily attributable to the increased deployment of residential video on demand systems in the united states by cable operators  offset in part by a decline in the number of expansion systems purchased by united states cable system operators for advertising insertion 
broadcast system segment revenues were million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended january  the decrease in broadcast revenues for the year ended january  was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures by broadcast companies that we believe reflects declining advertising revenues generated by those companies 
services revenues 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the annual renewals of technical support and maintenance service contracts  price increases on certain technical support and maintenance services and the impact of a growing installed base of systems 
revenues from our wholly owned subsidiary  digital video arts  were  in the year ended january  and million in the year ended january  for the years ended january  and january   certain customers each accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers each accounted for and of total revenues in the year ended january  and and of total revenues in the year ended january  revenue from these customers was primarily in the broadband segment 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the years ended january  and january   respectively 
no individual country except the us accounted for more than of total revenue 
as of january   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
therefore  we did not experience any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations 
systems gross profit 
costs of systems revenues increased to million in the year ended january  as compared to million in the year ended january  in the year ended january   the increase in the costs of systems revenues primarily reflects higher systems revenues within the video on demand products 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was and in the years ended january  and january   respectively 
gross profit for the broadband segment increased from of revenues for the year ended january  to of revenues for the year ended january  the increase in broadband gross profit percentages was primarily due to higher revenues and lower material costs on certain components due to technological advances offset in part by the amortization related to the deferred equity discount associated with the comcast equity investment and the million inventory reserve provision related to the termination of certain product development initiatives 
gross profit for the broadcast segment decreased from to for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease in the broadcast gross profit percentage is primarily due to lower revenues and increased pricing pressures from competitors 
services gross profit 
costs of services revenues decreased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  due to lower salaries and expenses related to our united kingdom and hotel product operations 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue was in the year ended january  and in the year ended january  the increase in services gross profit was primarily a result of higher revenues and a slight decrease in cost of services 
research and development 
research and development expenses remained relatively flat at million  or of total revenues  in the year ended january  compared to million  or of total revenues  in the year ended january  selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million or of total revenues  in the year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the year ended january  this increase is primarily due to increased sales commissions on higher revenues and higher travel costs related to increased direct sales efforts 
general and administrative 
in the year ended january   general and administrative expenses of million  or of total revenues  included the million provision for litigation and related expenses resulting from the ncube jury verdict see note to the accompanying financial statements 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  of million  or of total revenues  were million lower than the year ended january  primarily due to the provision from the ncube jury verdict in fiscal and lower legal costs associated with this patent infringement litigation in the year ended january  in addition  in the year ended january   we reversed  of the  provision recorded in the year ended january  for outstanding amounts owed by adelphia as a result of events that took place during fiscal related to adelphia s announcement of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy and our ability to sell the adelphia receivables to a third party 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was approximately million in the year ended january  and million in the year ended january  the increase in interest income primarily reflects higher average invested cash balances throughout the year and higher interest rates earned on the invested cash balance 
interest expense was approximately  in the year ended january  and  in the fiscal year ended january  equity income loss in earnings of affiliates 
equity loss in earning of affiliates was  in the year ended january  and equity income in earnings of affiliates was  in the year ended january  for the year ended january   the equity income in earnings of affiliates consists of our proportionate ownership share of the earnings of on demand group limited odg under the equity method of accounting 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate was and for the years ended january  and  respectively 
during the year ended january   we determined that our deferred tax assets would not be realizable for financial reporting purposes as a result of the cumulative pre tax book losses recorded over the previous fiscal years and the significant loss incurred in fiscal mainly as a result of the charge to operations recorded in the first quarter of fiscal related to the unfavorable jury verdict in the ncube litigation see note to the accompanying financial statements 
during the year ended january   we recorded income tax expense of million as a valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets as of that date 
through january   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization as a result of cumulative historical pre tax losses 
quarterly results of operations unaudited the following table presents unaudited financial information for the quarterly periods in the years ended january  and january  the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results  and we believe that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period amounts to the current year presentation 
three months ended april  july  october  january  april  july  october  january  in thousands  except per share amounts revenue gross profit operating expenses net income loss earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share diluted we have recently experienced significant variations in revenues  expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter and such variations are likely to continue 
a significant portion of our revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers  and it is difficult to predict the timing of future orders and shipments to these and other customers 
customers can cancel or reschedule shipments  and development or production difficulties could delay shipments 
during the quarterly periods outlined above  we experienced variations in our revenues from quarter to quarter primarily related to the significant growth of our video on demand products in the broadband segment  the fluctuations in our revenues from broadcast systems from quarter to quarter and the decline in revenues from our advertising products 
we experienced a significant decline in revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the first three quarters of fiscal the decline in revenues in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to a decline in video on demand revenues due to unanticipated delays in the order receipt  shipment and acceptance of certain orders 
this fourth quarter decline in systems revenue resulted in lower gross margins for the quarter and net income as compared to the prior three quarters of fiscal we have also experienced significant variations in our quarterly systems gross margins 
changes in pricing policies  the product mix  the timing and significance of new product introductions and product enhancements  and fluctuations in the number of systems affects manufacturing efficiencies and  accordingly  gross profits 
quarterly services gross margins have historically fluctuated significantly because installation and training service revenue varies by quarter while the related costs are relatively consistent by quarter 
operating expenses also vary with the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement introductions by us and our competitors  increased competition  the gain or loss of significant customers  the hiring of new personnel and general economic conditions 
during the quarterly periods outlined above  we experienced certain fluctuations in our operating expenses 
our selling and marketing costs fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of large tradeshows that take place in the first and third quarter of the year and significant promotional costs that are incurred for new product introductions 
all of the above factors are difficult for us to forecast  and these or other factors may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
only a small portion of our expenses vary with revenues in the short term and there would likely be a material adverse effect on our operating results if future revenues are lower than expectations 
based upon all of the forgoing  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and  therefore  should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds from sales of our common stock  borrowings and cash flows generated from operations 
cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at january  to million at january  largely due to cash provided by operating activities 
working capital increased from million at january  to million at january  net cash provided from operating activities for the fiscal years ended january  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the net cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended january  was the result of net income of million adjusted for non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of million and the changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 
the significant changes in assets and liabilities that provided cash from operations included an increase in deferred revenue of million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
these items that generated cash from operations were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase inventories of million and an increase in income taxes receivable of million 
we expect that the video on demand products within the broadband segment will continue to require a significant amount of cash to fund future product development and demonstration equipment and to meet higher forecasted revenue levels 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended january  and million for the year ended january  investment activity for fiscal consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities of million  an investment in an affiliated company of million  a loan to an affiliate for  an acquisition of a business of million and capital expenditures of million  offset by sales of marketable securities of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we concluded that it was appropriate to classify investments in auction rate securities as investments in marketable securities 
accordingly  the classification of these securities has been revised to report these securities as short term investments in a separate line item on the consolidated balance sheet as of january   and we also made corresponding adjustments to the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal years ended january  and january   to reflect the gross purchases and sales of these securities as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  in fiscal  the cash provided by financing activities included approximately million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repayments of capital lease obligations of  in fiscal  we entered into a million revolving line of credit with citizens bank a subsidiary of the the royal bank of scotland group plc that expired in the third quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we renewed the revolving line of credit with citizens bank for a two year period and increased the committed amount from million to million 
loans made under this revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s prime rate which was on january  borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the loan agreement requires that we provide citizens bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios including a minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization on a trailing twelve month basis  when amounts are outstanding under the loan agreement 
as of january   we were in compliance with the financial covenants 
there are currently no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
in fiscal  we entered into an agreement with bank of new hampshire to finance million of the construction costs related to the purchase and renovation of a manufacturing mill in new hampshire that we previously purchased in february upon occupancy of the building in november  the loan converted into two promissory notes whereby we paid principal and interest based upon a fixed interest rate of per annum over a five and ten year period 
borrowings under the loan were secured by the land and buildings of the renovated mill 
the loan agreement required that we provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain annual financial ratios on an annual basis 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we repaid the remaining  outstanding principal and interest under the loan 
in fiscal  we entered into a subscription and shareholders agreement the subscription agreement with odg  a company incorporated in england and wales that provides video on demand services in europe 
pursuant to the subscription agreement  we invested million uk pounds sterling approximately million in exchange for  ordinary shares of odg representing approximately of the total outstanding capital stock of odg on that date 
as part of the subscription agreement  we had committed to purchase additional ordinary shares and preference shares of odg from odg and certain of its existing shareholders under certain conditions in the agreement 
we also entered into a business development agreement with odg for a minimum of five years whereby odg agreed to exclusively purchase and to market and promote our video on demand systems and software worldwide in connection with furnishing video on demand services to odg s customers 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we and odg amended the subscription agreement to terminate our commitment to purchase additional ordinary and preference shares from odg and certain of its existing shareholders 
as part of the amended subscription agreement  we have committed to loan odg up to million uk pounds sterling approximately million payable in tranches of  uk pounds sterling or multiples thereof 
odg s ability to draw down the loan is subject to certain conditions including odg s execution of a carriage agreement with a cable operator prior to december  and its achievement of certain financial targets 
any outstanding loan amounts would mature five years from the date of the first draw down and interest is payable quarterly at the rate of per annum 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our loan commitment to odg was terminated 
in december  we purchased  common shares of odg from its principal owners for  uk pounds sterling approximately 
in january  we executed a secured loan agreement with casa systems  inc casa  a massachusetts development stage company that specializes in vod products within the telecommunications and television markets 
the total loan commitment is million to be drawn down in various installments 
the loan is to be paid back in quarterly installments of principal plus interest per annum  beginning with the first quarter ending march  the outstanding loan amount is secured by all of the assets of casa 
as of january    of the loan commitment amount was outstanding and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in january  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with minerva networks  inc minerva  a california based company specializing in software products for the telecommunications and television markets 
as part of minerva s series h preferred financing  we invested million for million shares of preferred stock of minerva representing of the total capital stock of minerva 
the preferred shares are convertible to million shares of common stock under certain conditions as defined in the stock purchase agreement 
we account for this investment under the cost method of accounting 
at the time of the investment in minerva  we entered into a software license agreement with minerva in which we agreed to purchase from minerva a license for its itv manager software and related source code for million 
the payment for the license and source code is conditional upon the acceptance of the software by us which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal we will capitalize the purchase of the license and source code and will amortize the amount over the expected life of the software license and source code starting with the first shipment of the product to a customer 
in february  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with insite one  inc insite  an off site medical imaging and data services company 
as part of the agreement  we invested million for million shares of cumulative convertible preferred stock of insite representing approximately of the total capital stock of the insite 
the preferred shares are convertible to common stock based upon defined conversion factors subject to adjustment as defined in the agreement 
in conjunction with the stock purchase agreement  we and insite entered into a master purchase agreement in which insite agreed to purchase our video on demand products and services under the terms and conditions defined in the agreement 
the following table reflects our current and contingent contractual obligations to make potential future payments in thousands payment due by period s total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years non cancelable lease obligations purchase obligations acquisition and investment commitments total it is typical for us to experience fluctuations in our monthly operating results primarily due to the timing of receiving customer orders and the related shipment of these customer orders 
as a result of these monthly fluctuations  we may experience an increase in our inventories as a result of procurement of both short and long lead components for anticipated orders for both our product segments  a decrease in our accounts payable balance primarily due to the timing of payments for materials purchased for prior month shipments  a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of customer shipments or customer deposits and a resulting increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that existing funds combined with available borrowings under the revolving line of credit and cash provided by future operating activities are adequate to satisfy our working capital  potential acquisitions and capital expenditure requirements and other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future  including at least the next months 
effects of inflation our management believes that financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation and price changes

r 
fin no 
r replaces fin no 
and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
a variable interest entity vie is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the financial position and results of the vie 
we evaluated our relationships with equity method investments and determined that the adoption of fin r in the quarter ended april  had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter fas 
fas amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  our adoption of the provisions of fas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the provisions of this statement are effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after june  we are currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact of sfas r on our financial position and results of operations 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts for fiscal years through  as if we had used a fair value based method under sfas  which is similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp no 
states that the impact of the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the ajca should be accounted for as a special deduction rather than a statutory rate reduction 
we are currently in the process of evaluating whether or not  and to what extent  if any  this provision may benefit us as well as the financial impact of this provision  if any 
in december  the fasb issued fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fas 
the ajca introduces a limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fas provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
although fas no 
was effective immediately  we do not expect to be able to complete our evaluation of the repatriation provision until after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
in january  the treasury department began to issue the first series of clarifying documents related to this provision 
we are currently in the process of evaluating whether or not  and to what extent  if any  this provision may benefit us as well as the financial impact of this provision  if any 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas no 
is based on the principle that exchange of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair market value of the assets exchanged 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception of nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
and do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue  as most of our revenues are in us dollars  and operating expenses in europe and asia 
historically  we have not hedged specific currency exposures as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions have not been material to date 
at january  and january   we had outstanding related to variable rate us dollar denominated debt 
as there were no amounts outstanding at january  and related to variable rate debt  there was no interest rate exposure 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables approximate fair value at january  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
as a result  we do not currently hedge these market risk exposures 
at january   we had million in short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities
