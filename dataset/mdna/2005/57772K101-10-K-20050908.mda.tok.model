critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company to make its most difficult and subjective accounting judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company s most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances  which impact the recording of revenues  valuation of inventories  which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which impacts write offs of fixed assets  accounting for income taxes  which impacts the income tax provision  and assessment of contingencies  which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
these policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further below 
the company has other key accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective  or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances the company recognizes revenue for sales to direct customers and sales to international distributors upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and the company does not have any significant post shipment obligations 
the company estimates returns for sales to direct customers and international distributors based on historical returns rates applied against current period gross revenues 
specific customer returns and allowances are considered within this estimate 
sales to us distributors are made pursuant to agreements allowing the possibility of certain sales price rebates and for non warranty product return privileges 
the non warranty product return privileges include allowing us distributors to rotate a small portion of the company s products in their inventory based on their previous days of purchases 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of non warranty product returns and sales price rebates that could be issued to us distributors  the company defers recognition of such revenue and related cost of goods sold until the product is sold by the us distributors to their end customers 
accounts receivable from direct customers  domestic distributors and international distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment at which point the 
table of contents company has a legally enforceable right to collection under normal terms 
in addition  the company estimates returns for sales to domestic distributors based on historical return rates applied against current period gross revenues 
the company makes estimates of potential future returns and sales allowances related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  changes in customer demand  and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of returns and sales allowances 
estimates made by the company may differ from actual returns and sales allowances 
these differences may materially impact reported revenue and amounts ultimately collected on accounts receivable 
in addition  the company monitors collectibility of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging 
when facts and circumstances indicate the collection of specific amounts or from specific customers is at risk  the company assesses the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and  if necessary  will record a charge in the period such determination is made 
to date  the company has not experienced material write offs of accounts receivable due to uncollectibility 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
the company s standard cost revision policy is to continuously monitor manufacturing variances and revise standard costs when necessary 
because of the cyclical nature of the market  inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  the company generally writes down inventories to net realizable value based on months forecasted product demand 
actual demand and market conditions may be lower than those projected by the company 
this difference could have a material adverse effect on the company s gross margin should inventory write downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary 
alternatively  should actual demand and market conditions be more favorable than those estimated by the company  gross margin could be favorably impacted 
during fiscal years  and  the company had inventory write downs of million  million and million  respectively  due primarily to work in process and finished goods inventory in excess of forecasted demand 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company performs periodic reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist that would indicate that the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable 
if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable  the company compares projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining useful life against their respective carrying amounts 
in the event that the projected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets 
evaluation of impairment of property  plant and equipment requires estimates in the forecast of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of the company s property  plant and equipment could differ from the company s estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
accounting for income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practicable tax planning strategies are considered 
in the event it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation 
table of contents allowance would be recorded 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
as of june   the company had recorded a million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
the million valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the expected tax benefits on gains realized from the exercise of stock options  which if and when realized  will be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital 
on a periodic basis the company evaluates its deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent the company believes it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income 
the company s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
contingencies from time to time  the company receives notices that its products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
the company periodically assesses each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  should be recorded 
in making this determination  management may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information obtained combined with management s judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  the company determines whether a contingent loss is probable and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated 
should a loss be probable and estimable  the company records a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  the company takes into consideration advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations which may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by management be incorrect  the company may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact the company s results of operations 
alternatively  if the judgments and estimates made by management are incorrect and a particular contingent loss does not occur  the contingent loss recorded would be reversed thus favorably impacting the company s results of operations 
results of operations net revenues the company reported net revenues of  million in fiscal year  a increase from net revenues of  million in fiscal year net revenues increased by during the first half of fiscal year compared to the first half of fiscal year net revenues remained flat during the second half of fiscal year compared to the second half of fiscal year the increase in net revenues for fiscal year is primarily due to higher unit shipments of the company s products

gross margin the company s gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the gross margin percentage increased from fiscal year to fiscal year due to continued improvement in manufacturing efficiencies driven primarily by the increased level of eight inch manufacturing which began in fiscal year and increased production volumes in fiscal year gross margins for both fiscal and fiscal were negatively impacted due to million and million recorded for discretionary employee bonuses  respectively  and due to million and million of write downs for inventory in excess of months of demand  respectively 
fiscal year gross margin was negatively impacted by million of start up costs at the company s wafer fabrication facility in san antonio  texas 
the company s gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the gross margin percentage increased slightly from fiscal year to fiscal year due to lower manufacturing costs driven by increased manufacturing volumes and eight inch wafer manufacturing which began in volume in fiscal year these improvements were offset by million of discretionary employee bonuses awarded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and million of start up costs at the company s newly acquired wafer fabrication facility in san antonio  texas

the level of research and development expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will vary from period to period  depending  in part  on the level of net revenues and  in part  on the company s success in recruiting the technical personnel needed for its new product introductions and process development 
the company continuously attempts to control and  if possible  reduce expense levels in all areas including research and development and wafer processing costs 
however  the company views research and development expenditures as critical to maintaining a high level of new product introductions  which in turn are critical to the company s plan for future growth 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
the increase in selling  general

outlook at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  backlog shippable within the next months was approximately million compared to million at the end of fiscal year  including approximately million compared to million at the end of fiscal year requested for shipment in the first quarter of fiscal year because the company s backlog of orders at any point is not necessarily based on firm  noncancelable orders and because the company s customers do in fact routinely cancel orders for their own convenience with little notice  backlog has limited value as a predictor of future revenues 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  bookings were approximately million  a increase over the previous quarter s level of million 
turns orders received during the fourth quarter of fiscal year were 
table of contents approximately million turns orders are customer orders that are for delivery within the same quarter and may result in revenue within the same quarter if the company has available inventory that matches those orders

the above increases were offset by the repurchase of million shares of the company s common stock for million  the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment  and the payment of million of dividends 
net inventory increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to the company s effort to increase die bank and finished goods inventory in order to be in a better position to ship product under a reduced lead time environment 
accounts payable decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to decrease in capital additions 
accrued salaries and related expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to increased accrued bonus and other payroll related accruals

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio  which includes us treasury  federal agency debt securities  and repurchase agreements relating to such securities 
investments mature at frequent intervals during the year  at which time the funds are available for use in the business  or for reinvestment  as cash demands dictate 
the company places its investments only in high quality financial instruments  limits the amount invested in any one institution or instrument  and limits portfolio duration 
this policy is intended to reduce default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio would vary by approximately million by a change in market interest rates of basis points 
exposure to interest rate fluctuations is mitigated by maintaining a laddered portfolio of investment instruments that mature at regular intervals over a three year investment 
table of contents horizon 
by creating a steady stream of cash from maturing investments  the company intends to generate cash to meet business needs without liquidating investments 
at june   the company s investment portfolio had an expected weighted average return of at june  and a weighted maturity of days days at june  
foreign currency risk the company transacts business in various non us currencies  primarily the japanese yen  british pound  and the euro 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable from sales in these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and liabilities of the related foreign subsidiary 
the company has established risk management strategies designed to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates 
these strategies reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements 
currency forward contracts are used to offset the currency risk of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the related currency forward contract 
the net realized and unrealized gains or losses from hedging non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities were immaterial in fiscal years and the company had forward contracts to sell foreign currencies for million and million at june  and june   respectively 
the fair market value of these forward contracts was million and million at june  and june   respectively 
a hypothetical favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at june  and june  would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
