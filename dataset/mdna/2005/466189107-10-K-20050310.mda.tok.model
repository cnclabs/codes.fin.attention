restatement of prior financial information we have restated the consolidated balance sheet at december   and the consolidated statements of operations  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years ended december  and december  in this annual report on form k 
we have also restated our quarterly financial information for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal see note m to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the restatement also affects periods prior to fiscal the impact of the restatement on such prior periods has been reflected as an adjustment of million to retained earnings as of december  in the accompanying consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity 
we have also restated the applicable financial information for fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in item selected consolidated financial data 
the restatement corrects our historical accounting for operating leases 
in light of views expressed by the securities and exchange commission on february  we  like many other retailers  reviewed our accounting practices in this regard 
based on our review  we determined that certain adjustments were needed 
as a result  we changed our lease accounting practice in fiscal and restated certain historical financial information 
the restatement adjustments are non cash and had no impact on revenues  comparable store sales or operating cash flows 
our historical accounting practice had been to recognize straight line rent expense for operating leases beginning on the commencement date specified in the lease  which had the effect of excluding the build out period for our stores and our corporate office from the calculation of the period over which we expensed rent 
based on our re examination of the applicable accounting literature  we determined that the proper accounting practice is to include the build out period in the amortization period for straight line rent expense on all operating leases and we changed our lease accounting practice accordingly 
the restatement includes adjustments to costs of products and merchandising  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses  operating income  income before taxes  income tax provision  net income and earnings per share 
this change in our lease accounting practice reduced net income by  in fiscal and had no effect on diluted earnings per share in fiscal the restatement adjustments decreased our net income and earnings per share in fiscal by approximately million or per diluted share  and reduced net income and earnings per share in fiscal by approximately million or per diluted share 
for information with respect to the restatement adjustments  see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we did not amend our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the restatement  and the financial statements and related financial information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon 
throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  all referenced amounts for prior periods and prior period comparisons reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis

our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
the months ended december  fiscal  december  fiscal and december  fiscal were week fiscal years 
net sales for fiscal increased by to million from million in fiscal operating income for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal our performance in fiscal was mixed 
while we experienced a very strong spring season  the fall season fell short of our expectations 
we believe that these mixed results are due to the confluence of several factors  including the fashion colors we chose to emphasize during each season  the weakening of our direct business during the year and increased spending associated with our product development and merchandising initiatives and sarbanes oxley compliance 
our spring season marked the first time that we had a dominant fashion color as the cornerstone of our assortment  namely the color pink 
not only was pink the principal color in our early spring collection but it was also the central focus of our highly successful tickled pink cross channel marketing campaign 
this campaign was followed by our cool ways to beat the heat marketing campaign which emphasized citrus colors 
the combination of the right merchandise  color and marketing message resulted in an extremely favorable customer response to our spring season collections in both segments 
in addition  our business was positively affected by a very strong external environment in the spring season 
in contrast  in the fall season  there was no dominant color or fashion trend and consequently our color palette and merchandising marketing execution were much like they had been in prior years 
in addition  the strong demand for our spring merchandise left us with unusually low levels of clearance inventory in our retail stores as we transitioned from spring into fall  and the external environment for women s apparel was somewhat weaker in the fall than in the spring season 
we opened new retail stores in fiscal and plan to open in our retail segment performance was better in fiscal than fiscal  with the segment generating a increase in sales per square foot  and a comparable store sales increase of  both largely attributable to our strong spring season performance 
fiscal was the first fiscal year in which retail segment net sales exceeded direct segment net sales 
retail segment net sales represented nearly of our total sales in fiscal while the performance of our retail segment improved over the prior year we believe sales per square foot needs to improve significantly in order for us to achieve our desired operating margins 
to this end  we are continuing to focus on ways to improve store productivity including reducing the size of our new stores to approximately  to  square feet  utilizing our cross channel database to drive store traffic and broadening and increasing the appeal of our merchandise offerings 
our direct segment performance weakened dramatically from spring to fall as a result of several factors including the many initiatives we implemented to improve our results in retail and the increase in overall store count 
in fiscal we implemented several changes in an effort to improve our results in retail including opening additional stores  aligning our catalog mailing dates with the dates we introduce new retail floor sets  increasing the amount of novelty items in our merchandising assortments 
while these initiatives had a positive effect on our retail segment  we believe they had an adverse effect on our direct business 
we are currently evaluating our direct segment business strategy  including our circulation strategy  page counts and catalog density  with an eye toward right sizing that part of our business 
there can be no assurance that the implementation of new initiatives in this area will improve sales productivity or the overall performance of the direct segment 
depending on which initiatives are selected  sales and profitability of this segment may significantly decrease in the future 
our fiscal operating results include costs related to two significant initiatives that resulted in increased spending during the year 
we made significant investments in our product development and merchandising infrastructure during fiscal we spent approximately million more in this area in fiscal than we did in fiscal to upgrade our operating infrastructure and processes in the areas of design  product development  sourcing  product integrity  supply chain operations and merchandising 
approximately million of this amount impacted the statement of operations primarily in the form of increased employee related costs  recruiting and relocation expenses and certain other corporate overhead costs and approximately million related to capital expenditures 
additionally  we spent approximately million in connection with our efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of  primarily for external consulting and increased fees for our independent registered accounting firm 
throughout fiscal we laid the foundation for our product development and merchandising initiative with respect to fit  quality and consistency 
our focus in will be on enhancing and evolving the aesthetics and creative expression of the brand by focusing on the novelty and color components of our merchandise assortments while also listening to and responding to the desires of our customers 
we believe that our continued investment in this area is critical to our future success 
however  we are mindful of the short term profitability impact of making those investments in advance of reaping the benefits and accordingly we plan to closely monitor and judiciously manage any further incremental spending 
specifically  and in addition to the merchandising enhancements noted above  during we plan to i embark on a three year product life cycle management system implementation  ii continue to develop our in house accessories design group  iii continue to refine and improve the fit of our merchandise  and iv expand our product categories 
there can be no assurance that the changes we are making in the product development and merchandising area will result in increased sales or profitability in the future 
our business in has been very difficult across both segments 
we attribute this weakness to several factors including  poor response to our early spring marketing campaigns and product offerings 
we believe that our first spring marketing message  with its focus on boating  may have been too summery and our current marketing campaign is facing some very difficult comparisons as we anniversary our highly successful tickled pink campaign from last year 
we believe that our ongoing design initiatives  combined with our fit evolution  may be creating the appearance that we are shifting our focus to a different or younger customer 
while this is not our strategy  we acknowledge that any change in the look  feel or fit of our merchandise has the potential to confuse the customer 
we will continue to closely monitor our customers response to the changes we are making in order to mitigate risk during this transition period and to better understand the customers recent preferences and perception of the j 
jill brand 
we plan to continue to evolve our fit and styling mix  by channel  to best serve both our existing and new customers 
based on the sales trends we have experienced since the beginning of we currently expect to generate a loss in the first quarter of of between and per share 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales is expected to decline significantly compared to the first quarter of fiscal primarily as a result of increased off price selling and promotional activity  higher inventory markdowns associated with current season overstocks and the de leveraging of operating expenses over lower than expected net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses are also expected to de leverage on lower than expected net sales 
we currently expect these trends to continue beyond the first quarter of this forward looking financial information is not a guarantee of actual performance 
historically  our performance has deviated  often materially  from our projections 
these statements do not include the potential for any business risks  opportunities or other developments that may occur after march  results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales twelve months ended december  december  december  restated restated net sales cost of products and merchandising gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense interest expense  net income before taxes income tax provision net income the following table summarizes net sales by segment in thousands twelve months ended december  december  december  retail    direct    other    total net sales    other represents outlet store net sales 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal primarily as a result of increased store count and higher sales productivity in both segments partially offset by lower circulation in our direct segment 
retail segment net sales increased by million  or  during fiscal this increase is attributable to a increase in the weighted average square footage of retail stores open during the year and a increase in retail segment sales productivity  as measured by net sales per weighted average square foot 
during fiscal  we opened retail stores and ended the year with retail stores 
comparable store sales for stores open at least one full fiscal year increased by during fiscal direct segment net sales decreased by million  or  during fiscal  as square inches circulated decreased by while direct segment sales productivity  as measured by net sales per  square inches circulated increased by 
the increases in the sales productivity of the retail and direct segments during fiscal are primarily attributable to the positive customer reaction to our spring season merchandise 
in addition  direct segment sales productivity was also positively affected by planned page count reductions and lower customer return rates 
internet net sales represented of total direct segment net sales during fiscal compared to during fiscal the increase in internet net sales is primarily attributable to the increased use of out bound e mails and cross channel marketing 
we expect internet net sales to represent an increasing portion of our total direct business over time 
we expect our future growth to come from our retail segment 
gross margin represents net sales less cost of products and merchandising 
cost of products and merchandising consists primarily of product costs eg  product development  sourcing  merchandising  inventory control and inventory acquisition costs and inventory markdowns and operating costs eg  occupancy and depreciation costs for our retail stores  order processing costs and distribution facility costs 
during fiscal  gross margin increased by million  or  to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased to during fiscal from during fiscal the percentage point increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a percentage point decrease in product costs and a percentage point decrease in operating costs  both as a percentage of net sales 
product costs as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily as a result of lower inventory markdowns and a shift in the mix of sales toward full price  particularly in our retail segment 
the decrease in operating costs as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a increase in retail segment operating costs and an increase in direct segment operating costs  offset by the leveraging effect of the year over year increase in net sales 
in addition  lower operations related depreciation also contributed to the decrease in operating costs as a percentage of net sales 
these factors were partially offset by the shift in the mix of our business toward retail and the fact that retail segment operating costs are currently higher as a percentage of net sales than direct segment operating costs 
we expect the differences between our retail and direct segment cost structures to diminish as we continue to focus on increasing the productivity of our retail stores  however  if our sales per square foot do not increase  the retail segment s overall profitability may not materially change in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of retail store selling costs  costs to produce  print and distribute catalogs  and website and corporate administrative costs 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from during fiscal the percentage point increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a percentage point increase in selling expenses and a percentage point increase in general and administrative expenses  both as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a increase in retail segment selling expenses  including a significant increase in costs associated with mailing catalogs to retail only customers  a decrease in direct segment selling expenses and the leveraging effect of the year over year increase in net sales 
in addition  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was negatively affected by the shift in the mix of our business toward retail and the fact that retail segment selling expenses are currently higher as a percentage of net sales than direct segment selling expenses 
we expect the differences between our retail and direct segment cost structures to diminish as we continue to focus on increasing the productivity of our retail stores  however  if our sales per square foot do not increase  the retail segment s overall profitability may not materially change in the future 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily as a result of increased spending on professional fees and employee related costs  together representing a million year over year increase in expenses 
in fiscal  professional fees incurred in connection with our efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act  excluding independent registered accounting firm fees of approximately million  totaled approximately million 
we estimate that this expense will decrease by approximately million in in addition  during fiscal we incurred consulting and legal fees of approximately million in connection with the implementation of changes in our operating structure 
we do not expect these expenses to recur in interest income increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal largely as a result of higher rates of return earned on our marketable securities investments in fiscal interest expense decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal primarily as a result of increased store count partially offset by lower sales productivity in both segments 
retail segment net sales increased by million  or  during fiscal this increase is attributable to a increase in the weighted average square footage of retail stores open during the year partially offset by a decrease in retail segment sales productivity 
during fiscal  we opened retail stores and ended the year with retail stores 
direct segment net sales decreased by million  or  during fiscal this decrease is attributable to a increase in square inches circulated being more than offset by a decrease in direct segment sales productivity 
the decreases in the sales productivity in the retail and direct segments during fiscal are primarily attributable to merchandising issues associated with our outdated product development and merchandising infrastructure 
internet net sales represented of total direct segment net sales during fiscal compared to during fiscal during fiscal  our gross margin decreased by million  or to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  our gross margin decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal the percentage point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a percentage point increase in product costs and a percentage point increase in operating costs  both as a percentage of net sales 
product costs as a percentage of net sales increased primarily as a result of increased off price selling in both segments and deeper sales discounts taken on off price merchandise in our retail segment during fiscal in addition  higher inventory markdowns also contributed to the increase in product costs as a percentage of net sales 
operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased primarily as a result of lower sales productivity in both segments 
gross margin was also affected by the shift in the mix of the business toward retail and the fact that retail segment operating costs are higher as a percentage of net sales than direct segment operating costs 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from during fiscal the percentage point increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a percentage point increase in selling expenses partially offset by a percentage point decrease in general and administrative expenses  both as a percentage of net sales 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily as a result of lower sales productivity experienced in both the direct and retail segments as well as the shift in the mix of the business toward retail and the fact that retail segment selling expenses are higher as a percentage of net sales than direct segment selling expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily as a result of the leveraging of such expenses over greater total company net sales 
during fiscal  spending on infrastructure investments  insurance and professional fees was million higher than in fiscal  but this spending increase was partially offset by cost savings associated with two significant charges taken in fiscal that were not repeated in fiscal during fiscal  general and administrative expenses included approximately million for cost incurred related to a potential strategic acquisition by us that was abandoned and a charge of million for a fully vested discretionary contribution to our deferred compensation plan 
interest income decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal interest expense decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease in interest income and interest expense resulted primarily from lower interest rates 
income taxes we provide for income taxes at an effective tax rate that includes the full federal and state statutory tax rates 
our effective tax rates for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  were  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively affected as a result of conducting business in states with higher tax rates 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was also negatively affected by an increase in the projected amount of non deductible expenses and a valuation allowance that we established at december  for million 
this valuation allowance relates to certain state net operating loss nol carryforwards where we believe that it is more likely than not that the associated tax benefit will not be realized 
the effective tax rate for fiscal includes the impact of the reversal of a million valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate for is estimated to increase as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of higher taxable income in states where we do business 
segment discussion and analysis we currently have two reportable business segments  retail and direct 
segment reporting is intended to give financial statement users a view of our business through the eyes of management 
our internal management reporting is the basis for the information disclosed for our business segments 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  our internally defined measure of segment profit or loss  segment contribution  is required to be disclosed  but is not a gaap measure 
information related to segment contribution should be read in conjunction with the reconciliation to operating income as determined by gaap 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we changed our segment reporting as a result of changes in the way management views the business 
outlet store revenues and expenses and inventory control costs  previously included in the retail and direct segments  have been reclassified to other 
additionally  we now include certain previously unallocated costs in the retail and direct segments  including certain sales allowances and order fulfillment costs 
net sales and segment contribution information for fiscal and fiscal have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation 
we evaluate segment profitability based on the contribution of each segment 
segment contribution represents each segment s net sales less direct costs related to the segment s operations 
direct costs for the retail and direct segments include merchandise acquisition and control costs and inventory markdowns 
direct costs also include retail store selling  including costs associated with catalogs mailed to retail only customers  occupancy  depreciation  inventory distribution and administrative costs for the retail segment and catalog costs  certain order processing costs  fulfillment costs and internet selling costs for the direct segment 
segment contribution less other and general and administrative expenses is equal to operating income 
other represents unallocated shared service costs such as product development  sourcing  merchandising  inventory control and distribution facility costs  as well as outlet store revenues and expenses 
general and administrative expenses include corporate executive management costs  support service costs eg  shared information systems  finance and human resources and corporate headquarters occupancy costs 
the accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
inter segment balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the following table provides a reconciliation of segment contribution to operating income in thousands twelve months ended december  december  december  restated restated retail segment contribution    direct segment contribution    other    general and administrative expenses    operating income    other represents unallocated shared service costs and outlet store revenues and expenses 
segment comparison of fiscal to fiscal retail segment contribution the retail segment s fiscal contribution increased by million  or  to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of segment net sales  segment contribution increased to during fiscal from during fiscal the percentage point increase in segment contribution as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a percentage point decrease in product costs and a percentage point decrease in operating costs partially offset by a percentage point increase in selling expenses  all as a percentage of net sales 
segment product costs as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of sales toward full price and lower inventory markdowns 
segment operating costs as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily as a result of the positive leverage on fixed operating costs such as occupancy and depreciation that comes from higher sales productivity per square foot 
segment selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily as a result of higher advertising costs  including costs associated with catalogs mailed to retail only customers  and in store visual costs 
advertising and visual costs more than doubled in fiscal as compared to fiscal direct segment contribution the direct segment s fiscal contribution decreased by million  or  to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of segment net sales  segment contribution decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal the percentage point decrease in segment contribution as a percentage of net sales was attributable to a percentage point increase in product costs and a percentage point increase in operating costs partially offset by a percentage point decrease in selling expenses  all as a percentage of net sales

segment operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased primarily as a result of higher order processing costs eg  order taking and fulfillment expenses 
segment selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily as a result of the leveraging of lower catalog costs over net sales 
catalog costs were lower during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of planned page count reductions 
other other net expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal primarily as a result of million of incremental spending on our product development and merchandising organization partially offset by million in lower depreciation expense primarily associated with certain fully depreciated systems and equipment

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations we expect there to be fluctuations in our net sales from quarter to quarter  with the highest net sales coming in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year and the lowest in the first and third quarters 
see note m for selected quarterly financial data  including information regarding our quarterly net sales 
as our retail store sales become a greater portion of our overall business  our business is becoming more seasonal 
our retail store rollout plan is expected to materially impact year over year comparisons of our net sales 
also  january is included in our first fiscal quarter  but is included in the fourth fiscal quarter for many other retailers 
because january is a month that traditionally involves significant promotional pricing  this difference needs to be taken into account when making comparisons of our financial performance for interim periods with that of other retailers 
liquidity and capital resources our principal working capital needs arise from the need to support costs incurred in advance of revenue generation  primarily inventory acquisition  catalog development  production and mailing costs 
we have two selling seasons that correspond to the fashion seasons 
the spring season begins in january and ends in july 
the fall season begins in july and ends in january 
our capital investment needs arise from initiatives intended to support our growth  including our retail store rollout and improvements to our physical and operating infrastructure 
during fiscal  we funded our working capital and capital investment needs with cash generated from operations and cash on hand 
during fiscal  we invested million in marketable securities in an effort to increase the rate of return on cash 
we intend to maintain a liquid portfolio consisting primarily of fixed income securities 
at december   the aggregate fair value of our marketable securities was million 
we did not have any marketable securities during fiscal and fiscal as a result of this investment  cash and cash equivalents cash decreased by million during fiscal we generated million in cash from operations  invested million in property and equipment primarily related to our retail store rollout  and received million from stock transactions primarily from the exercise of stock options 
during fiscal  net income before depreciation and amortization  additional deferred credits from landlords and higher amounts accrued and payable were the primary sources of cash from operations 
the primary use of cash from operations related to increases in inventory 
cash increased by million during fiscal we generated million in cash from operations  invested million in property and equipment primarily related to our retail store rollout  and paid down million in debt 
during fiscal  net income before depreciation and amortization  additional deferred credits from landlords and decreases in inventory were the primary sources of cash from operations 
the primary use of cash from operations related to increases in other assets primarily as a result of prepaid income taxes 
accounts receivable balances at december  and december  were relatively comparable primarily as a result of higher deferred billing receivables being offset by lower receivables from landlords 
our deferred billing programs provide our customers with the option of deferring payment for their purchases 
the deferral period is generally to days 
for deferred billing offered on our private label credit card  we typically receive cash from the sale within four business days from the date of purchase 
for deferred billing offered on major credit cards  we receive cash after the deferral period expires  net of any returns or adjustments processed during the deferral period 
at december  and december   there were million and million  respectively  of trade receivables outstanding related to our deferred billing programs 
inventory at december  was  or million  higher than at december  primarily as a result of higher upcoming spring season inventory balances on hand at the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal and inventory associated with new retail stores opened since december  at december   inventory balances from the fall season were up significantly as compared to fall season balances at december  this increase was almost entirely offset however by lower prior season inventory balances 
in fiscal the inventory turn in our retail segment increased to turns per year from in fiscal inventory per store in our retail segment was higher at december  than at december  a summary of our inventory balances follows in thousands december  december  retail   direct   other total   other consists of inventory related to outlet stores 
accounts payable balances at december  were  or million  higher than at december  primarily as a result of higher amounts payable for inventory partially offset by lower expense payables 
accrued expenses at december  were  or million  higher than at december  primarily as a result of higher accrued amounts for gift certificates  insurance  deferred compensation and professional fees partially offset by lower amounts for customer refunds in process 
deferred credits from landlords and other at december  were  or million  higher than at december  primarily as a result of opening additional retail stores 
deferred credits from landlords and other consists primarily of step rent and allowances from landlords related to our retail stores 
step rent represents the difference between actual operating lease payments due and straight line rent expense  which is recorded by us over the term of the lease  including the build out period 
this amount is recorded as a deferred credit in the early years of the lease  when cash payments are generally lower than straight line rent expense  and reduced in the later years of the lease when payments begin to exceed the straight line expense 
landlord allowances are generally comprised of amounts promised to us by landlords in the form of cash or rent abatements 
these allowances are part of the negotiated terms of the lease 
in situations where cash is to be received  we record a receivable for the full amount of the allowance when certain performance criteria articulated in the lease are met  typically when the store opens  and a liability is concurrently established 
this deferred credit from landlords is amortized into income through lower rent expense over the term including the pre opening build out period of the applicable lease and the receivable is reduced as amounts are received from the landlord 
the liability for unamortized landlord allowances  including current portion  was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
most of our retail store leases contain provisions that allow for early termination of the lease by either party if certain predetermined annual sales levels are not met 
generally  these provisions allow the lease to be terminated between the third and fifth year of the lease 
should the lease be terminated under these provisions  the unamortized portion of any landlord allowances related to that property would be payable to the landlord 
during fiscal we opened retail stores and at december  we had retail stores and five outlet stores open 
with our front end product development and merchandising transition underway and taking into account our strong balance sheet and the increasingly competitive landscape within our target demographic  we plan to accelerate our new store openings in we currently plan to open new retail stores in the cash requirements related to our retail store rollout are significant and are primarily comprised of leasehold improvements  net of landlord allowances  and initial inventory acquisition costs 
construction commitments are typically made one to six months in advance of a new retail store opening and actual construction typically begins two to three months before the store opens 
the initial net cash requirements for opening a new retail store are currently estimated at an average of approximately million per store

our credit facilities at december  consisted of i a million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  ii a million real estate loan the tilton facility loan  and iii a million equipment loan the equipment loan 
on september   we amended the revolving credit facility primarily to extend its term and modify or delete certain lending conditions and covenants 
the maturity date of the revolving credit facility  as amended  is june  the total amount available under the revolving credit facility is million and is reduced by outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
outstanding borrowings may not exceed million 
letters of credit are primarily used to procure inventory from foreign vendors 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property  both tangible and intangible

our credit facilities contain various lending conditions and covenants including restrictions on permitted liens 
we were in compliance with the covenants associated with our credit facilities as of and for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  we plan to embark on the implementation of several key operating systems in including  i a product life cycle management system  ii a suite of purchasing  inventory management and planning system  and iii a centralized data warehouse 
all of these systems initiatives are long term projects with implementation periods ranging from two to four years at an estimated aggregate cost of approximately million 
we believe that these systems are necessary to support our future growth 
our sources of cash include cash on hand  our investments in marketable securities  available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and anticipated cash flow from operations 
our principal uses of cash include cash required to support current operations as well as investments in infrastructure and our retail store rollout 
based on current operating conditions  we believe we have sufficient sources of cash to execute our operating plans and fund our planned operating and systems infrastructure investments  capital expenditures and commitments for the foreseeable future 
should current operating conditions deteriorate  we believe we have some flexibility to adjust our mid to long term operating plans  including our retail store rollout and our circulation strategies 
critical accounting policies in the normal course of business  we record inventory markdowns associated with our overstocked merchandise 
we look at past and projected sales performance and inventory on hand and on order when calculating an expected level of overstocks 
based on the estimated level of overstocks and the estimated net realizable amount of the overstocks  we record inventory markdowns in order to state our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we have internal and external liquidation vehicles that we utilize to liquidate our overstocks 
internal channels  including sales catalogs  price reductions in the retail stores and our five outlet stores generally require lower markdowns and are considered first 
after the internal capacity is exceeded  external channels are considered 
external channels include discount marketers and inventory liquidators 
if the cumulative write downs associated with inventory markdowns are not accurate our gross margin and inventory balances may be overstated or understated 
we record accruals for estimated product returns for direct segment sales using the following process 
first  we determine an appropriate return rate for each current catalog 
in doing so  we consider a number of factors  including prior years and prior seasons return rates for comparable j 
jill catalogs and internet offerings  trends in return rates from season to season and within the current season and applicable operational factors 
once a return rate is determined  it is monitored and updated periodically as appropriate to reflect changes in underlying assumptions based on actual experience 
the return rate is used to calculate an appropriate returns allowance for the applicable catalog or internet offering for the applicable period 
we also provide a returns allowance for retail segment sales 
we provide this allowance based on projected merchandise returns  taking into consideration historical experience and other factors 
these returns allowances are recorded as a reduction to net sales for the estimated retail value of the projected merchandise returns and as a reduction to cost of products for the corresponding cost amount 
if our estimated returns allowances are not accurate  our returns reserves may be understated or overstated  resulting in an overstatement or understatement  respectively  of sales and earnings 
we incur costs to produce  print and distribute our catalogs 
catalog costs in our direct segment are considered direct response advertising and as such are capitalized as incurred and amortized over the expected sales life of each catalog  which is generally a period not exceeding six months 
creative costs for a season  which will benefit multiple catalogs  are allocated to each catalog taking into consideration relative catalog size and circulation 
the amortization of our direct segment catalog costs is meant to match revenues with expenses 
the expected sales life of each catalog is determined based on a detailed marketing forecast  which considers historical experience for similar catalogs as well as current sales trends 
these forecasts are updated frequently during the most active period of selling for each catalog to determine the expected total sales of the catalog 
we monitor changes to the forecast and adjust the amortization period accordingly 
if our calculation of the amortization period is incorrect  it could result in a mismatch of revenues and expenses in a particular period 
catalog costs in our retail segment are considered advertising and as such are expensed as incurred 
we periodically consider whether there has been a permanent impairment in the value of our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment 
we evaluate various factors after a start up phase  including current and projected future operating results and the undiscounted cash flows for the underperforming long lived assets 
we then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
to the extent that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is written down to its estimated fair market value and an impairment loss is recognized 
the value of impaired long lived assets may be adjusted downward periodically based on changes in these factors 
any adjustments to the value of our long lived assets are included in either cost of products and merchandising or selling  general and administrative expenses depending on where depreciation related to that asset has been historically recorded 
if our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is incorrect  the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated 
recent accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r sfas r  share based payment  a revision of fasb issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires the measurement of all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to certain employee stock purchase plans  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  accordingly  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts for fiscal through fiscal  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock based compensation awards 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas r 
the adoption of this standard is expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
based on our current projections  we expect the future expense to be recognized as a result of the adoption of sfas r to be significantly less than the pro forma amounts historically disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements due to the fact that many of our historical grants will be fully expensed as of the third quarter of and we anticipate a significant reduction in the amount of options to be granted in the future 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  inventory costs 
sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of converting work in process to finished goods be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our objective in managing our long term exposure to interest rate and foreign currency rate changes is to limit the material impact of the changes on cash flows and earnings and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we periodically identify these risks and manage them through our regular operating and financing activities 
these activities include periodic refinancing of debt obligations to increase availability while minimizing financing costs  considering fixed and variable rate debt positions and periodic review of the return on investment of our marketable securities portfolio 
marketable securities investments are subject to interest rate and credit risks 
changes in interest rates may affect our operating results 
we currently invest in highly liquid  interest bearing instruments  primarily municipal debt securities 
our investments include securities with a minimum credit rating of a by moody s and a by standard and poor and no individual investment in the portfolio  except investments in us treasury and us agency securities  is greater than of the total portfolio  so potential losses on individual securities is minimized 
our investment policy limits interest rate risk by requiring the investment portfolio to be structured such that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations  thereby avoiding the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity 
in addition  operating funds are invested primarily in shorter term securities  money market mutual funds  or similar investment pools 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
we have calculated the effect of a change in interest rates over a month for both our debt obligations and our marketable securities investments and determined the effect to be immaterial 
we do not foresee or expect any significant changes in the management of foreign currency or interest rate exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposures in the near future 
we have established a trust in connection with our deferred compensation plan 
the trust assets are invested in corporate owned life insurance in a manner that is designed to approximate the measurement designations of the plan participants  for both vested and unvested balances 
investments are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
due to the level of risk associated with certain investments  it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of these investments will occur in the near term and that such changes will also impact participant deferred compensation balances based on the measurement designations made by the plan participants 
changes in value of the trust assets are intended to mirror changes in the value of the participants deferred compensation accounts
