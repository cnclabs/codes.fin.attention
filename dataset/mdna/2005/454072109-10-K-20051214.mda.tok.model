item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on this form k 
description of the company we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the acquisition  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and product candidates primarily focused in the areas of urology  gynecology and men s health 
we currently market sanctura for oab and we have six compounds in clinical development 
our urology  gynecology and men s health portfolio contains one marketed product and four compounds in development 
sanctura  launched in august  is co promoted with esprit 
sanctura xr  currently in phase iii trials  is a once daily formulation of sanctura 
nebido  for male hypogonadism  was licensed from schering in july pro is a topical microbicide for the prevention of infection by hiv and other std s 
ip is for pain and inflammatory disorders  including interstitial cystitis 
additional compounds in development include pagoclone for the treatment of stuttering and aminocandin for systemic fungal infections 
recent product developments sanctura in april  we entered into the sanctura agreement for the us commercialization of sanctura  which was launched in august effective november   the sanctura agreement was converted from a co promotion agreement to a royalty bearing structure and approximately of our primary care sales representatives became pliva employees 
under this royalty bearing structure  we received royalties from pliva based on net sales of sanctura  and pliva was responsible for promotional and advertising costs 
additionally  for the three years commencing november   pliva began subsidizing  at an annual rate of approximately  our specialty sales force which promotes sanctura to urology specialists  obstetricians and gynecologists  and other high prescribers 
in may  we  pliva and esprit  entered into the amendment and consent agreement  whereby the company consented to the acquisition by esprit of the rights to market sanctura from pliva and the assumption by esprit of pliva s obligations under the sanctura agreement except for the minimum detail and sales force requirements which were waived 
the amendment and consent agreement also amended certain economic provisions of the sanctura agreement 
esprit agreed to pay us increased royalties on net sales of sanctura at annual minimum amounts of   and  for the first three years of the amendment and consent agreement  respectively 
additionally  the annual sales force subsidy  paid monthly  was increased to  through december  and will be paid for one additional year at an annual rate of  also  esprit has granted us the right to co promote one of esprit s future products on terms to be negotiated 
pursuant to the closing of the amendment and consent agreement  on july  we received a payment of  relating to amounts due to us  including  for manufactured bottles of sanctura ordered by pliva  expected to be delivered to esprit in fiscal and reflected as deferred revenue at september   and  related to reimbursed development costs  which was also reflected as deferred revenue and is being amortized into contract and license revenue over the term of the sanctura agreement 
in june  we announced results from a pilot phase ii study of sanctura xr 
this was a two week multi center  placebo controlled  double blind study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sanctura xr in patients with overactive bladder 
sanctura xr exhibited similar efficacy to previous results of the currently marketed sanctura which is given twice a day 
in addition  sanctura xr was very well tolerated 
in september  we initiated the phase iii clinical program for sanctura xr 
the program consists of two week  double blind  placebo controlled studies totaling  patients at approximately sites in the united states 
the objective of the trials is to evaluate the effects of once daily dosing of trospium chloride on urinary frequency  urge incontinence  and other related symptoms associated with oab 
as a result of the initiation of the phase iii program  we received a  milestone payment from esprit in september we expect to file an nda with the fda for sanctura xr in the second half of calendar nebido in july  we entered into a license agreement with schering whereby we licensed exclusive us rights from schering to market nebido  a long acting injectable testosterone preparation for the treatment of male hypogonadism 
under the terms of the schering agreement  we are responsible for the development and commercialization of nebido in the united states 
schering will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying commercial product to us 
we will pay to schering up to million in up front  regulatory milestone  and commercialization milestone payments  including a million up front payment made in july and million upon approval by the fda to market the product 
we also agreed to pay to schering of net sales to cover both the cost of finished product and royalties 
pursuant to a pre ind meeting with the fda  we will conduct a single  pharmacokinetic study following hypogonadal men for approximately six months to supplement the existing clinical database 
we anticipate starting this trial in the first quarter of calendar and filing an nda in the first quarter of calendar pro in october  the mdc sponsored and mrc funded multi national phase iii trial commenced 
this trial involves researchers in the uk  cameroon  south africa  tanzania  uganda and zambia 
an estimated  women will be enrolled in this trial that is expected to last approximately to years and include interim analyses of safety and efficacy data conducted by an independent data safety monitoring board 
we contribute clinical supplies to this trial 
an nih sponsored phase ii iii clinical trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of pro in blocking male to female hiv transmission began in february at sites in africa and the united states 
the study involves approximately  hiv uninfected women  most of whom are at risk for acquiring hiv by virtue of living in regions where the rate of infection is high 
the trial will also evaluate effectiveness against other sexually transmitted diseases 
we contribute clinical supplies to this trial also 
in february  findings from a study performed at the mount sinai school of medicine were presented at the th conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections 
these data demonstrated that pro retains activity against hiv and the herpes simplex virus following intravaginal administration to hiv infected women 
the study  funded by the nih  marks the first time that the anti viral activity of a microbicide has been demonstrated following human application 
ip in march  we announced the results of a study conducted at the university of pittsburgh that showed that administration of ip  a novel synthetic cannabinoid  significantly reduces the bladder overactivity observed in an animal model of interstitial cystitis 
ip suppressed the overactivity in a dose dependent manner and at the highest dose completely reversed the excessive bladder contractility to normal function 
in addition  ip appeared to have no effect on the normal voiding mechanism of the bladder 
we have now completed a second study confirming these results 
we expect to begin the clinical program for ip in interstitial cystitis in calendar pagoclone in july  we initiated a phase ii trial of pagoclone in patients with persistent developmental stuttering 
the trial is being conducted in adults at investigational sites in the united states 
we expect to have results from this study in mid calendar in february  we were granted a new us patent covering the use of pagoclone for the treatment of stuttering 
aminocandin aminocandin is in development to treat systemic fungal infections 
in october  we commenced a multi dose phase i trial of aminocandin 
during dose escalation  we saw some local vein irritation as doses and concentrations increased causing us to interrupt the trial 
we believe we have identified the formulation issues that caused such vein irritation and we are currently working on reformulations of the intravenous dosage form and will be testing the new formulations in preclinical models 
overall  the product continues to have a favorable systemic safety profile 
we plan to resume phase i testing in delatestryl in december  we entered into an agreement to acquire delatestryl  testosterone enanthate  a marketed injectable testosterone replacement therapy for the treatment of male hypogonadism  from savient pharmaceuticals  inc the delatestryl agreement is expected to close in january subject to certain contractual and financial conditions 
upon closing  we will make an initial cash payment to savient of million and will be committed to pay a total of approximately million for delatestryl inventory  including our assumption of savient s previous obligation to purchase approximately million of additional delatestryl inventory 
we expect to commence selling delatestryl upon closing 
under the terms of the delatestryl agreement  we will pay royalties to savient for three years following the closing of the transaction based upon the cumulative net sales of delatestryl 
the royalty rate will be on the first million of cumulative net sales following closing increasing to on cumulative net sales between million and million 
the royalty rate on cumulative net sales above million will be  subject to a minimum annual payment of  following the quarter in which cumulative net sales reach million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
expected term of the sanctura agreement and deferred revenue we are recording the  of initial and milestone payments received from pliva and the  milestone payment received from esprit as deferred revenue and amortizing each component into revenue using the contingency adjusted method over the estimated remaining duration of the sanctura agreement commencing on the date such payments are earned 
all of our obligations under the sanctura agreement continue and our analysis of the term of the sanctura agreement was not affected by esprit s assumption of pliva s obligations 
we believe the estimated term of the sanctura agreement is a significant estimate which affects revenue recognized and the balance of deferred revenue on our balance sheet and we explain our estimate of the expected twelve year term of the sanctura agreement below 
the sanctura agreement expires on the later of i the twelfth th anniversary of the launch date of sanctura or ii the expiration of the last to expire patent included in the indevus patent rights covering sanctura xr 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab specifies that unless evidence suggests otherwise  service revenues should be recognized over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period over which services are expected to be performed  if longer 
we considered the following factors in evaluating the expected duration of the sanctura agreement sanctura does not have marketing protection afforded by patents and is currently being marketed pursuant to five years of market exclusivity provided by the waxman hatch act  the potential of success in developing sanctura xr including the filing of an nda and ultimate approval by the fda to market sanctura xr  the potential of success in obtaining approval of patents covering sanctura xr and the protection such patents may afford  if protection from patents was not obtained for sanctura xr  the potential benefit of any reliance on market exclusivity that may be provided by the waxman hatch act  the strong competition in the overactive bladder market including competition from large pharmaceutical companies 
after considering all of the above  we estimated the expected term of the sanctura agreement to be twelve years  consistent with the negotiated minimum term of the arrangement of twelve years from launch of sanctura 
in the event development of sanctura xr was terminated prior to approval for marketing by the fda the expected term of the arrangement would likely be less than twelve years 
in the event sanctura xr is approved for marketing by the fda  achieves an acceptable measure of market success  and we are able to obtain and benefit from patent protection for sanctura xr  the term of the arrangement may extend beyond the estimated twelve years 
we amortized  and  of deferred revenue into contract and license fee revenue in fiscal and  respectively  and the balance of deferred revenue related to the initial and the subsequent milestone payments at september  is  we will reevaluate our estimate of the expected term of the sanctura agreement when new information is known that could affect our estimate 
if we change our estimate of the duration of the sanctura agreement in the future and extend our estimate of its duration we would decrease the amount of periodic revenue to be recognized from the amortization of remaining deferred revenue 
if we decrease our estimate of the duration of the sanctura agreement in the future we would increase the amount of periodic revenue to be recognized from the amortization of remaining deferred revenue 
insurance claim receivable as of september   we had an outstanding insurance claim of approximately  for services rendered through may  by the group of law firms defending us in the redux related product liability litigation 
the full amount of our current outstanding insurance claim is made pursuant to our product liability policy issued to us by reliance insurance company reliance  which is in liquidation proceedings 
based upon discussions with our attorneys and other consultants regarding the amount and timing of potential collection of our claim on reliance  we previously recorded a reserve against our outstanding and estimated claim receivable from reliance to reduce the balance to the estimated net realizable value of  reflecting our best estimate given the available facts and circumstances 
we believe our reserve of approximately  against the insurance claim on reliance as of september  is a significant estimate reflecting management s judgment 
to the extent we do not collect the insurance claim receivable of  we would be required to record additional charges 
alternatively  if we collect amounts in excess of the current receivable balance  we would record a credit for the additional funds received in the statement of operations 
redux related liabilities at september   we have an accrued liability of approximately  for redux related expenses  including legal expenses 
the amounts we ultimately pay could differ significantly from the amount currently accrued at september  to the extent the amounts paid differ from the amounts accrued  we will record a charge or credit to the statement of operations 
revenue recognition policy product revenue consists of revenues from sales of products  commissions  royalties and reimbursements for royalties owed by us to madaus pursuant to the sanctura agreement 
contract and license fee revenue consists of revenue stemming from contractual initial and milestone payments received from customers  including amortization of deferred revenue from contractual payments  reimbursements from pliva for their share of sanctura promotion and advertising costs incurred by us  less an amount owed by us to pliva for our share of sanctura promotion and advertising costs incurred by pliva  sales force subsidies  and grants from agencies supporting research and development activities 
we record sales of product as product revenue upon the later of shipment or as title passes to our customer 
in fiscal  we commenced selling sanctura to pliva in bottles for resale and blister packs for distribution as samples 
royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize our licensed technologies and are generally reported to us in a royalty report on a specified periodic basis 
royalty revenue is recognized in the period in which the sales of the product or technology occurred on which the royalties are based 
if the royalty report for such period is received subsequent to the time we are required to report our results on form q or form k and the amount of the royalties earned is not estimable  we recognize such royalty revenue in the subsequent accounting period when we receive the royalty report and when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to us in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement 
our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development or co promotion agreements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of our products or product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on net product sales 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
in multiple element arrangements where we have continuing performance obligations  license fees are recognized together with any up front payment over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations  unless the delivered technology has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements in the arrangement 
we record such revenue as contract and license fee revenue 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
we record such revenue as contract and license fee revenue 
under the sanctura agreement  the initial and subsequent milestone payments  once earned  are recognized as contract and license fee revenue using the contingency adjusted performance model 
under this model  when a milestone is earned  revenue is immediately recognized on a pro rata basis in the period we achieve the milestone based on the time elapsed from inception of the sanctura agreement to the time the milestone is earned over the estimated duration of the sanctura agreement 
thereafter  the remaining portion of the milestone payment is recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated duration of the sanctura agreement 
multiple element arrangements are evaluated pursuant to emerging issues task force issue number  accounting revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
pursuant to eitf  in multiple element arrangements where we have continuing performance obligations  contract  milestone and license fees are recognized together with any up front payments over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligation  unless the delivered technology has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective  reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered element in the arrangement 
in the case of an arrangement where it is determined there is a single unit of accounting  all cash flows from the arrangement are considered in the determination of all revenue to be recognized 
additionally  pursuant to the guidance of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  unless evidence suggests otherwise  revenue from consideration received is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected term of the arrangements 
in particular relating to the sanctura agreement  the company and pliva were contractually bound to share certain promotion and advertising costs relating to sanctura 
for promotion and advertising costs incurred by us  reimbursements from pliva for pliva s share were reflected in contract and license fee revenue 
for promotion and advertising costs incurred by pliva  reimbursements to pliva for our share were reflected as a reduction of contract and license fee revenue 
cash received in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  our net loss decreased  to  or per share  basic  in fiscal from  or per share  basic  in fiscal this reduced loss is primarily the result of increased revenues from sanctura and decreased sales and marketing expenses  partially offset by increased research and development expenses 
total revenues increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to sanctura 
fiscal reflected a full year of revenues related to the marketing of sanctura and amortization of deferred revenue 
fiscal reflected only a partial year of revenues from the marketing of sanctura and six months of amortization of deferred revenue as sanctura was approved for marketing by the fda on may  and launched in august product revenue  which includes royalties and sales of product  increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal royalties on sanctura were  including  of royalties due to madaus  in fiscal this compares to  of royalties on sanctura  including  of royalties due to madaus  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to a full year of marketing sanctura compared to only several months of marketing sanctura in fiscal fiscal sanctura royalty revenue included  of minimum royalties  including  of royalties due to madaus  from esprit 
partially offsetting increased sanctura royalty revenue in fiscal was a  or  decrease in sales of product  including bottles and samples  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal fiscal sales of product were higher as pliva had purchased product to satisfy initial orders and to provide samples for the launch of sanctura 
additionally  royalties from lilly on sales of sarafem decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal contract and license fee revenue increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and relates almost entirely to the sanctura agreement 
amortization of deferred revenue increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to a full year of amortization in fiscal compared to six months of amortization in fiscal fiscal also included  of sales force subsidy 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of  in contract and license fee revenue to  of net sanctura promotion and advertising costs due to pliva from us in fiscal reflected as a reduction to revenue 
this compares to  of net sanctura promotion and advertising costs due to us from pliva in fiscal reflected as revenue 
cost of product revenue relates primarily to sanctura and includes cost of product sold and royalties we owe to madaus 
cost of product revenue increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal cost of sanctura sold decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal we sell sanctura to our marketing partner at cost and this decrease is commensurate with the decreased sales of product as described above 
royalties to madaus increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal commensurate with increased sanctura royalty revenue as described above 
pursuant to the sanctura agreement  we are reimbursed the royalties we owe to madaus on sales of sanctura

marketing  general and administrative expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to decreased marketing costs related to sanctura 
marketing expenses decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal promotion and advertising costs related to sanctura decreased approximately  as significant expenses were incurred in fiscal to launch sanctura 
subsequent to the conversion  pliva was  and esprit is now  responsible for such costs 
partially offsetting the decreased promotion and advertising costs are approximately  of increased sales force and sales operations related costs 
this increase reflects increased costs related to our approximately person specialty sales force and related infrastructure which was in place for all of fiscal compared to approximately five months in fiscal partially offsetting the increased costs related to our approximately person specialty sales force and related infrastructure are decreased costs related to the approximately person primary care sales force which was in place for only the first two months of fiscal compared to approximately five months in fiscal general and administrative expense remained relatively constant at approximately  in fiscal and fiscal certain nonrecurring expenses incurred in fiscal were offset by other increased costs incurred in fiscal in fiscal  we extended the expiration dates of certain stock option grants to directors and officers and reflected a noncash charge of approximately  in general and administrative expense for these extensions

investment income increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal while weighted average invested balances in fiscal were somewhat lower than weighted average invested balances in fiscal  the increase in investment income is primarily the result of higher interest rates 
interest expense relates to our  of convertible senior notes due the convertible notes 
annual interest expense is approximately  and includes approximately  of amortization of debt issuance costs 
the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal relates to us federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax 
tax recognition of the initial and milestone payments received pursuant to the sanctura agreement in fiscal were deferred to fiscal when they were recognized in full 
utilization of tax loss carryforwards is limited for use against the us federal alternative tax and by certain states resulting in federal and state tax obligations in fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  our net loss increased  to  or per share  basic  in fiscal from  or per share  basic  in fiscal this increased net loss is primarily the result of our product launch and marketing of sanctura 
total revenues increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to  of revenues pursuant to the sanctura agreement offset by  of reduced revenues from lilly for sarafem 
product revenue increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to sales of sanctura to pliva in fiscal which were  including  related to sales of samples

this is a decrease of  or  from  included in fiscal cost of product revenue resulting from the reduction of revenue from lilly as described above 
research and development expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal development costs related to sanctura decreased approximately  due to decreased costs related to sanctura and other development costs partially offset by increased development costs for sanctura xr  including  of milestone payments in fiscal to shire which is developing once a day formulations of sanctura 
further contributing to the decrease were license fees in fiscal of  paid to aventis for aminocandin and  related to the transactions that resulted in our licensing ip directly from the owner of the intellectual property rights 
in fiscal  we extended the expiration dates of certain stock option grants to an officer which resulted in a noncash charge of approximately  to research and development expense 
increased staffing in fiscal resulted in approximately  of additional personnel costs 
increased development activities related primarily to aminocandin  ip  pro and other products resulted in approximately  of increased development costs 
total research and development expenses for fiscal substantially relate to our major compounds being developed as follows sanctura  pagoclone  ip  aminocandin  and pro  we also incurred research and development expenses for fiscal of  related to other compounds and initiatives 
marketing  general and administrative expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal marketing expenses increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal fiscal included significantly increased promotion and advertising expenses related to sanctura and the build up of the sales force infrastructure related to the launch and continued marketing of sanctura

investment income increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is due to higher weighted average invested balances  offset somewhat by lower interest rates 
market interest rates substantially decreased in fiscal from fiscal  however  due to the receipt of  in the three month period ended june  pursuant to the sanctura agreement  weighted average invested balances were substantially higher resulting in an increase in investment income 
interest expense of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  results from our july issuance of the convertible notes 
annual interest expense includes approximately  of amortization of debt issuance costs 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  we had consolidated cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  compared to  at september  this decrease of  was primarily the result of net cash used in operating activities of  see analysis of cash flows 
we are continuing to invest substantial amounts in the ongoing development and sales activities related to sanctura and our other product candidates 
we believe we have sufficient cash for currently planned expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we will require additional funds or corporate collaborations for the development and commercialization of our other product candidates  as well as any new businesses  products or technologies acquired or developed in the future 
we have no commitments to obtain such funds 
there can such be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing to satisfy future cash requirements on acceptable terms  or at all 
if such additional funds are not obtained  we may be required to delay product development and business development activities 
product development we expect to continue to expend substantial additional amounts for the development of our products 
in particular  we are continuing to expend substantial funds for sanctura  sanctura xr  and other related development efforts 
we are responsible for conducting and funding the development of sanctura xr 
we could receive approximately million in future payments contingent upon the filing and approval of an nda for sanctura xr 
esprit will not have an obligation to pay the development milestone of approximately million related to the fda approval of the nda for sancrura xr or the million long term commercialization milestone and the rights to sanctura xr will revert to us if esprit provides notice to us no later than the approval date that it does not intend to proceed with the launch of sanctura xr 
additionally  after november  and pursuant to the conversion  pliva had been  and esprit is now  responsible for funding certain phase iv studies that may be conducted 
there can be no assurance that results of any ongoing or future pre clinical or clinical trials will be successful  that additional trials will not be required  that any drug or product under development will receive fda approval in a timely manner or at all  or that such drug or product could be successfully manufactured in accordance with cgmp  or successfully marketed in a timely manner  or at all  or that we will have sufficient funds to develop or commercialize any of our products 
we have entered into an agreement with madaus for the manufacture of sanctura 
in order to manufacture sanctura for sale in the united states  madaus manufacturing facility must comply with cgmp requirements 
failure to meet or maintain compliance with cgmp requirements could cause a material disruption of  or cessation in  the commercialization of sanctura 
we may seek a second source for sanctura if madaus is unable to continue to meet all regulatory requirements or provide the necessary quantities of sanctura in a timely manner  this alternate source would require fda approval which may or may not be obtained 
total research and development expenses incurred by us through september  on the major compounds currently being developed or marketed  including allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  are approximately as follows  for sanctura and sanctura xr   for nebido   for pro   for ip   for pagoclone  and  for aminocandin 
in june  we re acquired rights to pagoclone from pfizer inc during the period pfizer had rights to pagoclone  pfizer conducted and funded all development activities for pagoclone 
estimating costs and time to complete development of a compound is difficult due to the uncertainties of the development process and the requirements of the fda which could necessitate additional and unexpected clinical trials or other development  testing and analysis 
results of any testing could result in a decision to alter or terminate development of a compound  in which case estimated future costs could change substantially 
certain compounds could benefit from subsidies  grants or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 
in the event we were to enter into a licensing or other collaborative agreement with a corporate partner involving sharing  funding or assumption by such corporate partner of development costs  the estimated development costs to be incurred by us could be substantially less than the estimates below 
additionally  research and development costs are extremely difficult to estimate for early stage compounds due to the fact that there is generally less comprehensive data available for such compounds to determine the development activities that would be required prior to the filing of an nda 
given these uncertainties and other risks  variables and considerations related to each compound and regulatory uncertainties in general  we estimate remaining research and development costs  excluding allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  from september  through the preparation of an nda for our major compounds currently being developed as follows approximately  for sanctura xr   for nebido   for pro  approximately  for ip  approximately  for aminocandin  and approximately  for pagoclone 
actual costs to complete any of our products may differ significantly from the estimates 
we cannot reasonably estimate the date of completion for any compound that is not at least in phase iii clinical development due to uncertainty of the number  size  and duration of the trials which may be required to complete development 
analysis of cash flows cash used in operating activities in fiscal of  consisted primarily of the net loss of  the net decrease in deferred revenue of  is the result of  milestone payments and product prepayments received from pliva and esprit and  of amortization into contract and license fee revenue 
a use of cash resulted from a  reduction of accounts payable primarily due to reduced operating expenses from the cessation of sanctura related promotion and advertising activities pursuant to the conversion and general timing of payments 
a further use of cash of  resulted from a reduction of accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily from reduced inventory due to a reduced rate of production of sanctura and the cessation of promotion and advertising costs pursuant to the conversion  partially offset by increased accruals related to research and development activities and other operating activities 
a  source of cash resulted from a net reduction of accounts receivable due to collections from pliva 
net cash provided by investing activities of  is primarily due to maturities and sales of marketable securities of  less  of capital expenditures 
net cash provided from financing activities of  resulted from net proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk related to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  primarily in short term bank deposits  money market funds  and domestic and foreign commercial paper and government securities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars and are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk
