actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
general we and our subsidiaries  tulsat  tulsat nebraska  ncs  comtech services  tulsat texas  tulsat atlanta and jones broadband international  inc comprise an organization involved in the re manufacture  repair and sale of previously owned cable television catv equipment and the distribution of new and surplus equipment to catv operators 
new sales are defined as products that are purchased from the manufacturer  and includes new surplus  which is defined as inventory items purchased from other distributors or multi system operators with excess equipment that have never been used 
remanufactured sales are defined as used inventory that is updated to meet customer needs and requirements

index to financial statements overview fiscal continued to be a challenging business climate in our industry due to many of the large cable customers allocating a higher percentage of their capital expenditures to meeting challenges from regional telephone companies such as verizon and sbc as they attempt to provide data  voice  and video services 
many of the smaller cable systems are limited to the amount of capital they can raise to meet these challenges coupled with competition from dbs and directv 
our subsidiaries continued to increase their revenues and market share with the larger cable customers based on relationships and being able to meet their needs by shipping directly from our inventory 
our increase in sales of new motorola and scientific atlanta products were the result of having the products on the shelf 
our customers are primarily providers of broadband network delivered services 
our largest customers are the cable  multi system operators although we serve telephone companies  television programmers and broadcasters  municipal utilities  distributors and other broadband service providers 
our strategy is to identify features  products and systems which are needed by our customers in significant numbers 
the markets we serve consist of several large multiple cable customers and many smaller cable companies 
the pace of technology change is rapid and requires a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the services offered to customers as well as the equipment to deliver the services 
accordingly  maintaining direct relationships with our customers is important 
we specialize in providing current products for replacement  rebuilds or adding channel capacity 
even though we sell leading edge products  the majority of our sales are for legacy products 
in the fourth quarter  we experienced significant revenue growth as a result of our agreement with scientific atlanta to be the exclusive distributor of its system amplifier iii rf platform and other cable television equipment products to the us and latin america markets 
additionally  we recognized a total of approximately million of incremental revenue in the fourth quarter related to the active hurricane season as well as approximately  of increased revenue attributable to jones broadband international  inc  which we acquired in august our ability to deliver inventory from stock on demand played a significant role in our fourth quarter and fiscal revenues and net income 
we anticipate that the continuation of our growth strategy in fiscal will produce another record year 
we believe our strong relationships with leading product manufacturers  including motorola and scientific atlanta  and our positive reputation in the multi billion dollar catv industry positions us for long term success 
our plan is to drive future performance through an expanded sales force  both domestic and overseas  enhanced strategic partnerships  and additional strategic acquisitions that complement our existing one stop shop capabilities and are accretive to earnings 
on august   we purchased of the outstanding stock of jones broadband international  inc jbi  for consideration consisting of approximately million in debt assumption  including

index to financial statements accrued liabilities  and cash of approximately million 
the total purchase price represented the approximate book value of jbi  consisting of million of inventory after an approximate  write down to market  and million of other assets including receivables and fixed assets 
jbi s main office is in oceanside  california and it has a warehouse in stockton  california 
we maintain good working relationships with the existing jbi sales and marketing staff and believe their west coast presence with access to our other subsidiaries products will make this a good acquisition 
we will be evaluating future investments as they present themselves 
results of operation year ended september   compared to year ended september  all references to years are to fiscal years net sales 
net sales climbed million  or  to million for from million for sales of new and refurbished equipment increased from million in to million for  primarily due to the positive results of our marketing initiatives and the strengthening of our distributor relationships 
sales of new scientific atlanta and motorola equipment increased substantially as we strengthened our strategic alliances with these manufacturers 
repair service revenues decreased by from million last year to million this year 
the decrease in repair services was due to several recent changes in the market 
multi system operators have been consolidating headends reducing the number required to do the job 
this in turn has allowed operators to use the extra headends as replacements instead of repairing the ones not working 
finally  several years ago the manufacturers started giving five year warranties on their products 
these warranties are set to run out in and and we expect the repair business will return to us 
costs of sales 
costs of sales include the costs of new and refurbished equipment  on a weighted average cost basis  sold during the period  the equipment costs used in repairs  and the related transportation costs

critical accounting policies and estimates note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for fiscal year includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
some of those significant accounting policies or methods require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us 
we believe the following items require the most significant judgments and often involve complex estimates 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current market conditions  and various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the carrying value of our inventory and  to a lesser extent  the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation our position in the industry requires us to carry large inventory quantities relative to annual sales  but also allows us to realize high overall gross profit margins on our sales 
we market our products primarily to multi system operators and other users of cable television equipment who are seeking products for which manufacturers have discontinued production  or cannot ship new equipment on a same day basis 
carrying these large inventories represents our largest risk 
our inventory consists of new and used electronic components for the cable television industry 
inventory cost is stated at the lower of cost or market and our cost is determined using the weighted 
table of contents 
index to financial statements average method 
at september  we had total inventory of approximately  consisting of approximately  in new products and approximately  in used or refurbished against which a reserve of  for excess and obsolete inventory leaves us a net inventory of approximately  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements from our customers 
we regularly review the value of our inventory in detail with consideration given to rapidly changing technology which can significantly affect future customer demand 
for individual inventory items  we may carry inventory quantities that are excessive relative to market potential  or we may not be able to recover our acquisition costs for sales that we do make 
in order to address the risks associated with our investment in inventory  we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the carrying value when the loss of usefulness of an item or other factors  such as obsolete and excess inventories  indicate that cost will not be recovered when an item is sold 
during the last two fiscal years ended september   we have increased our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory over  to almost of total inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable then those projected by management  and our estimates prove to be inaccurate  we could be required to increase our inventory reserve and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
inbound freight charges are included in costs of sales 
purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  warehousing costs  internal transfer costs and other inventory expenditures are included in operating expenses since the amounts involved are not considered material 
accounts receivable valuation management judgments and estimates are made in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts 
specifically  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness  as in the case of the bankruptcy of adelphia and its affiliates  or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the reserve for bad debts increased to  at september  from  at september  this increase represents less than of a percent of total revenues and is due to the increasing level of sales revenue and its corresponding exposure 
at september   accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  amounted to million

this revision is to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that these items be recognized as a current period charge regardless of whether they meet the criterion specified in arb this statement requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we elected to adopt sfas no 
beginning with fiscal year the adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which replaced sfas and superseded apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair market values and requires that such recognition begin in the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
in april  the securities and exchange commission the sec postponed the effective date of sfas r until the issuer s first fiscal year beginning after june  we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal under sfas r  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we will apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we will apply the modified prospective method  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock upon adoption of sfas r

our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our revolving line of credit
