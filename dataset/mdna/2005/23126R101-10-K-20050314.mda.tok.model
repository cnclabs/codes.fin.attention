we use internal resources to develop our potential protein therapeutics and have established development alliances with abgenix  inc abgenix to support antibody projects  bayer ag bayer to support small molecule projects for diabetes  topotarget a s topotarget to support small molecule histone deacetylase hdac inhibitor projects for oncology and inflammatory diseases  and seattle genetics  inc seattle genetics to support antibody drug conjugate projects 
strategy we hope to generate value for our shareholders by focusing our resources on developing genomics based therapeutics to improve the lives of patients 
we are striving to become profitable by commercializing a subset of therapeutics stemming from our development pipeline  and establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and commercialization of other therapeutics from our development pipeline 
drug development approach we have taken a systematic approach to identifying and validating the therapeutic targets we believe to be the most promising from the human genome 
by leveraging our technology and informatics foundation  we have identified  genes  both novel and known  with the potential to be targets for therapeutic drug development 
based on disease associations in cellular and animal models  we have qualified of these targets as possibly playing a role in disease 
by evaluating the relative medical need  biology  speed of path to patients  and strength of intellectual property position of these targets  we have selected our priority projects for development 
as our pipeline of priority projects has matured over the past few years  we have decreased our early stage target discovery efforts and focused our resources on the advancement of our pipeline of potential protein  antibody  and small molecule therapeutics through clinical development 
we have priority projects of protein  antibody  and small molecule therapeutics in preclinical and clinical development across the therapeutic areas of oncology  inflammatory diseases  and diabetes 
protein therapeutics proteins are molecules composed of amino acids found in the human body 
there are many types of proteins  all carrying out a number of different biological functions 
protein therapeutics can treat conditions in which a person is either missing an important protein or would benefit from additional amounts of a given protein 
we are applying our genomics expertise and knowledge of disease to develop protein therapeutics in the areas of oncology and inflammatory diseases 
we have identified genes whose protein products may make 
table of contents suitable therapeutics  have disease associations and are potentially protected by our intellectual property position 
we have implemented protocols for the production  purification and testing of our proteins  and have established cell based assays for characterizing the therapeutic potential of these proteins 
using animal models  we are currently evaluating the activity of a number of proteins as potential human therapeutics 
proteins with activity and favorable toxicity profiles are then selected for clinical development 
our first product to enter into clinical trials was cg  also known as fibroblast growth factor fgf  a protein therapeutic we discovered  which is being investigated for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis om  a side effect experienced by patients receiving radiation and or chemotherapy for cancer treatment 
this product is now in a phase ii clinical trial for the prevention of om 
cg is also active in multiple animal models of inflammatory bowel disease 
human monoclonal antibody therapeutics we are applying our genomics expertise and knowledge of disease to develop antibody therapeutics primarily in oncology and inflammatory diseases 
we have identified genes that make suitable targets for antibody therapeutics  have disease associations and may be protected by intellectual property rights 
we are developing antibody therapeutics with our partner abgenix  a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and manufacturing of human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies 
we and abgenix are evaluating many antibody development programs and we plan on advancing the most promising into clinical development 
cr  our first fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutic to enter a phase i clinical trial  has the potential to be a promising treatment for patients with iga nephropathy  and other diseases such as lupus and diabetes  in which kidney inflammation  when left untreated  may progress to kidney failure necessitating kidney transplantation 
we are also evaluating cr  a fully human monoclonal antibody drug conjugate adc  as a potential treatment for metastatic melanoma  a deadly form of skin cancer  and expect to initiate clinical trials in the first half of small molecule therapeutics we have applied our genomics expertise and knowledge of disease to identify small molecule therapeutics primarily in two disease areas diabetes and oncology 
our small molecule diabetes program is partnered with bayer 
in this alliance  we intend to co develop small molecule therapeutics to treat type adult onset diabetes and will co commercialize resulting products 
the first compound resulting from this collaboration is ct  an orally administered small molecule that has a potentially novel mechanism of action for treating type diabetes 
we expect to initiate clinical trials with ct in the first half of we are also exploring with topotarget the role of hdac inhibitors  including pxd  for the treatment of solid and hematologic cancers 
our most advanced small molecule product  pxd  is in a phase ii clinical trial in patients with advanced multiple myeloma 
disease focus we are focusing our discovery and development efforts on three disease areas that have fast growing markets and large unmet medical needs 
oncology nearly million people throughout the world are diagnosed with cancer each year 
the direct and indirect medical costs to treat cancer total more than billion each year  and in the united states alone  cancer takes the lives of  people on average each day 
most of our protein and antibody therapeutics are being developed to help cancer patients 
the first indication being investigated in phase ii for our clinical product  cg  is for the prevention of oral mucositis  a side effect experienced by patients undergoing cancer therapy 
our first small molecule hdac inhibitor  pxd  is being investigated in phase ii for the treatment of multiple myeloma  and is being evaluated in other solid and hematologic malignancies either alone  or in combination 
table of contents with other chemotherapeutic agents 
our first fully human monoclonal adc  cr  is being investigated as a potential treatment for metastatic melanoma  a deadly form of skin cancer  and is expected to enter clinical trials in the first half of in addition  we are developing several other preclinical protein  antibody  adc and hdac inhibitor therapeutics as potential cancer treatments 
inflammatory diseases more than million americans suffer from major inflammatory diseases 
arthritis  various forms of respiratory inflammation and debilitating inflammatory bowel disease are a daily reality in the lives of millions of individuals 
for some sufferers  surgery is an undesirable last resort 
however  surgery cannot restore diseased tissue to its previously healthy state 
by focusing on the underlying causes of diseases  we are making progress in developing therapeutics to treat the damage caused by inflammatory disorders 
cr  our first fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutic to enter a phase i clinical trial  has the potential to be a promising treatment for patients with iga nephropathy  and other diseases such as lupus and diabetes  in which kidney inflammation  when left untreated  may progress to kidney failure necessitating kidney transplantation 
diabetes approximately million americans are overweight or obese and million have been diagnosed with diabetes 
in the united states alone  the direct and indirect costs related to the treatment of overweight and obese individuals is over billion and of diabetics is over billion 
these conditions are reaching epidemic proportions and causing a tremendous burden on the healthcare system 
our collaboration with bayer is for the development of small molecules for the treatment of diabetes 
ct  a small molecule therapeutic with a potentially novel mechanism of action for treating type diabetes  represents the first preclinical therapeutic from this ongoing collaboration and is being prepared to enter clinical trials in the first half of clinical products cg for oncology support in  we became one of the first genomics companies to discover  validate  and successfully advance a novel therapeutic candidate from the human genome into phase i clinical trials when we received us food and drug administration fda clearance to begin testing cg in patients 
in october  we advanced cg into phase ii with the initiation of a randomized  placebo controlled  multi center clinical trial to evaluate its safety and efficacy  following a single dose  for the prevention of om for patients receiving high dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation hsct 
cg  also known as fgf  is a novel investigational protein therapeutic being studied for the prevention and treatment of om that occurs following exposure to chemotherapy and or radiation therapy 
om is a side effect that can be experienced by patients receiving radiation and or chemotherapy for cancer treatment 
the condition is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the tissue lining the mouth and throat leading to bleeding  pain  and difficulty eating and drinking 
in addition to leading to debilitating symptoms  om may result in the interruption of radiation or chemotherapeutic protocols in oncology patients 
a therapeutic that could prevent or treat om successfully would not only mitigate debilitating symptoms  but also may enable cancer patients to receive the optimum dosage of radiation therapy or chemotherapy needed to fight their cancer 
in february  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for cg in om  which we believe will help to strengthen the program by offering important clinical development and commercialization benefits 
in december  we received fast track status from the fda to investigate cg for the prevention of om in patients receiving hsct following myeloablative chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation tbi 
the fast track program enables a company to file a new drug application nda on a rolling basis as data becomes available and permits the fda to review the filing as it is received  rather than waiting for the entire document prior to commencing the review process 
with a fast track designation  there is 
table of contents an opportunity for more frequent interactions with the fda and the possibility of a priority review  which could decrease the typical review period 
the potency of cg is believed to be due to the molecule s activity in promoting proliferation of two critical layers of cells epithelial and mesenchymal present in the mucosa lining of the mouth and the remainder of a patient s gastrointestinal tract 
the molecule has demonstrated activity in two animal models of om and the data for these studies was published in the journal clinical cancer research in in june  we presented animal model data at the th annual international symposium on supportive care in cancer held by the multinational association of supportive care in cancer that highlighted the potential of this molecule and differentiated it from competing products 
the data demonstrates that a single dose of cg administered to animals exposed to chemotherapy  but before the development of active om  reduces the severity and duration of subsequent om  and that administration of cg to animals with active om resulted in a significant reduction in the number of days and severity of om 
this preclinical data supports our strategy to investigate cg as a single dose agent for the prevention of om and as well as for the treatment of active om 
two phase i trials evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of cg for the prevention of om have been completed 
in november  abstracts containing preliminary results from both phase i trials were published in the proceedings of the th annual meeting of the american society of hematology ash 
in december  data from the phase i trial on cg for cancer patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation was presented during the ash conference 
preliminary data on the safety  pharmacokinetics  and potential efficacy of cg on of patients treated with a single dose of cg suggested that cg was well tolerated with no serious drug related adverse events noted 
mild moderate reactions including nausea  vomiting  tachycardia  hypotension  chills  and fever were observed  and infusional reactions in the two patients treated at the highest dose level were considered dose limiting 
a total of out of patients did not develop severe grade or om 
of the four patients experiencing severe grade or om  all were treated with high dose melphalan  a highly mucosatoxic chemotherapeutic regimen  and the duration of om was brief days for three of these patients 
in october  we initiated a phase ii trial on cg that is currently enrolling patients in a randomized  placebo controlled  multi center study to determine the safety and efficacy of a single dose of cg to prevent the development of clinically significant om 
approximately patients in the united states will be randomized to receive a single administration of either placebo or one of three dosage levels of cg immediately after bone marrow transplantation 
a phase i clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability on cg for the treatment  as opposed to the prevention  of om is anticipated to be initiated in the first half of studies in other clinical indications are planned 
pxd for oncology in june  we added pxd  a novel hdac inhibitor  to our pipeline through a license and collaboration agreement with topotarget 
pxd will be investigated as a potential treatment of both solid and hematologic cancers either alone  or in combination with other cancer drugs 
the collaboration with topotarget also provides us with access to their extensive library of hdac inhibitor candidates for future commercialization by curagen 
hdac inhibitors represent a new mechanistic class of anti cancer therapeutics that target hdac enzymes  and have been shown to arrest growth of cancer cells  induce apoptosis  or programmed cell death  promote differentiation  inhibit angiogenesis  and sensitize cancer cells to overcome drug resistance 
in august  we signed a clinical trials agreement with the national cancer institute nci that provides us with access to the expertise at the nci for the design  implementation  and monitoring of clinical trials with pxd under the agreement  the nci will sponsor several clinical trials evaluating the activity of pxd  either alone or in combination with other anti cancer therapies  for the treatment of solid and 
table of contents hematologic malignancies 
nci sponsored clinical trials will occur in parallel to those sponsored by curagen  with all data generated available for use in future product registration 
in january  we initiated a phase ii clinical trial evaluating pxd on patients with advanced multiple myeloma 
this phase ii clinical trial is an open label  multi center study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pxd administered as a single agent and in combination with dexamethasone  for the treatment of advanced multiple myeloma in patients who have previously failed at least two treatment regimens 
the trial is expected to enroll approximately patients at multiple sites in europe and the united states 
following enrollment  patients will receive mg m day of pxd administered intravenously once daily for five consecutive days every three weeks for two cycles 
patients will then be evaluated for tumor response by standard criteria and will either continue receiving up to eight cycles of pxd if they demonstrate response or stable disease  or begin combination therapy consisting of pxd and dexamethasone 
the study is expected to be complete by mid cr for kidney inflammation in october  we announced that cr received clearance from the fda to be investigated as a potential treatment for iga nephropathy 
cr is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody being investigated as a potential treatment of kidney inflammation to prevent or slow the progression of iga nephropathy toward kidney failure 
cr is designed to block the activity of platelet derived growth factor d  or pdgf d  a protein shown to play a role in kidney inflammation 
cr is the most advanced fully human monoclonal antibody from our collaboration with abgenix 
in november  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for cr as a potential treatment to slow the progression of iga nephropathy and delay kidney failure in patients affected by the disease  which we believe will help to strengthen the program by offering important clinical development and commercialization benefits 
in november  we initiated a phase i clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of cr on healthy male volunteers 
kidney inflammation typically is characterized by a loss of architecture and diminishing function that may eventually lead to kidney failure  necessitating dialysis or kidney transplantation 
kidney inflammation is usually managed clinically by the use of non specific immunosuppressants  which have variable efficacy and debilitating side effects 
a study conducted in an animal model of kidney nephritis  published in the journal of the american society of nephrology in  earned a congress award at the world congress of nephrology meeting 
cr will be one of the first therapeutics aimed at treating a cause of kidney inflammation 
pipeline in addition to our three therapeutics in clinical development  we have two priority projects being advanced through preclinical development and a pipeline of potential protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics that have been  or are ready to be evaluated in animal studies 
the majority of our advanced protein and antibody therapeutics are in the areas of oncology and inflammation  and our small molecules are primarily in the areas of oncology and diabetes 
many of the investigational new drug ind applications that we anticipate filing in the future will be from our pipeline  and have been or are ready to be evaluated in animal studies 
we anticipate that in the first half of both cr  an adc being investigated as a potential treatment for metastatic melanoma  and ct  a small molecule therapeutic with a potentially novel mechanism of action for treating type diabetes stemming from our collaboration with bayer  will enter into clinical trials 
collaborations our technology and expertise have been used in our partnerships with more than a dozen leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies including biogen  inc biogen  genentech  inc 
genentech  glaxosmithkline  inc gsk  hoffmann la roche inc 
roche and pfizer inc 

table of contents in addition  we have established a pipeline of potential therapeutics by leveraging the capabilities of industry leaders to more efficiently advance our programs  reduce risk  and conserve resources 
we have developed four classes of therapeutics protein therapeutics which are developed in house  fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutics which are developed in collaboration with abgenix  small molecule therapeutics for oncology and inflammatory diseases which are developed in collaboration with bayer and topotarget  and adcs which are developed in collaboration with abgenix and seattle genetics 
abgenix in december  we entered into a strategic alliance with abgenix to develop and commercialize genomics based antibody therapeutics using abgenix xenomouse technology 
this six year alliance was established initially to identify fully human antibody therapeutic candidates primarily in oncology 
antibodies determined to have commercial product potential will be allocated between the parties for further development 
under the terms of the agreement  the developing party will pay milestone and royalty payments to the other party for products resulting from this drug development alliance 
potential aggregate milestone payments payable per product launched are approximately million 
in addition  under the agreement  abgenix purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for million through a private placement 
in november  we expanded our alliance with abgenix to include the potential for generating fully human monoclonal antibodies against a larger number of targets and for treating a broader range of complex diseases including autoimmune disorders 
as part of this expanded alliance  abgenix purchased an additional  shares of our common stock at a price of approximately per share for million through a private placement 
either party can terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of contract by the other party  with days written notice 
in addition  either party may terminate the agreement upon a breach of certain payment or diligence obligations by the other party if such breach continues  in the case of certain payment obligations  for days and  in the case of certain diligence obligations  for days  after written notice of such breach was provided by the non breaching party 
our collaboration with abgenix has been very productive 
fully human monoclonal antibodies have been raised against over targets and many of these programs are being evaluated for advancement into cellular and animal validation 
in november  we initiated a phase i clinical trial with cr  our leading fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutic stemming from this collaboration  as a potential treatment for kidney inflammation to prevent or slow the progression of iga nephropathy toward kidney failure 
in october  we announced that cr  an antibody drug conjugate  is being advanced toward clinical development with an expected filing of an ind application with the fda and initiation of clinical trials to occur during the first half of our abgenix collaboration has enabled us to leverage the resources and expertise of one of the world s leaders in generating fully human monoclonal antibodies and has fueled our pipeline with a total of five proprietary fully human monoclonal antibodies whose development we control 
bayer in january  we signed two comprehensive agreements with bayer 
as part of these agreements  bayer purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a private placement totaling million 
the first agreement is a comprehensive alliance to discover  develop  and jointly commercialize small molecule therapeutics to treat metabolic disorders  primarily adult onset diabetes 
we are to provide therapeutic targets to bayer and grant bayer access to our comprehensive suite of functional genomic technologies  bioinformatics and pharmacogenomic expertise to select and prioritize the resulting therapeutics 
bayer will utilize its development expertise to develop small molecule therapeutics against the targets supplied by us 
bayer is responsible under the agreement for funding all high throughput screening  combinatorial chemistry  medicinal chemistry and pharmacology activities until a designated preclinical stage 
expenses are equally split with bayer 
table of contents for later stage preclinical and clinical compound development to fund the relevant research  development and commercialization activities 
if we jointly commercialize any therapeutics resulting from this alliance with bayer  bayer will receive of the profits associated with that therapeutic and we will receive 
either party can terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of contract by the other party  upon days written notice day notice for payment breach 
bayer may terminate the agreement if there is a change in control involving us  upon providing days written notice to us within days 
we may terminate the screening term upon a change in control of bayer  upon providing written notice to bayer within days 
our collaboration with bayer has been very productive 
in october  we announced that the first small molecule compound stemming from this collaboration was advanced to the preclinical stage 
ct is an orally available small molecule therapeutic being investigated as a potential treatment for type diabetes 
ct has a potentially novel mechanism of action for treating type diabetes and is expected to enter phase i in the first half of the second agreement is a broad  five year pharmacogenomic and toxicogenomic collaboration 
we are applying our functional genomic technologies and pharmacogenomics expertise to evaluate bayer s developmental and preclinical pipeline of pharmaceutical compounds across all disease areas 
through the efforts of this collaboration  we and bayer expect to reduce drug development costs  reduce the time to market  and create safer and more efficacious therapeutics 
either party can terminate upon an uncured material breach of contract by the other party  upon days written notice 
in certain circumstances bayer may terminate the agreement if there is a change in control involving us  upon providing written notice to us within days 
topotarget in june  we signed a license and collaboration agreement with topotarget to develop pxd  a novel hdac inhibitor for the treatment of solid and hematologic malignancies and identify additional hdac inhibitors from topotarget s extensive library of compounds 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired exclusive rights to develop  and commercialize pxd in north america  asia and all other markets excluding europe 
topotarget retains commercialization rights in europe 
during june  we made a million equity investment in  and paid a million perpetual license fee to topotarget 
in addition  topotarget is eligible to receive up to million within a period of months from june in milestones and research support  million over the subsequent months in research support  and up to million in additional milestone payments based on successful development  regulatory approval  and commercialization of pxd topotarget is expected to receive royalties from us based on sales of pxd outside of europe  and we expect to receive reciprocal royalties from topotarget based on sales of pxd in europe 
we will fund the global development of pxd in addition  we have an option to select additional hdac compounds from topotarget for clinical development in oncology and other indications for a take up fee not to exceed million and up to million in milestone payments based on successful development  regulatory approval  and commercialization of each additional product 
topotarget has the option to fund a portion of the global development of pxd and additional products in exchange for higher royalties 
potential payments to topotarget from us based on the successful development and commercialization of pxd and two additional hdac inhibitor products could exceed million 
either party can terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of contract by the other party with days written notice  or if either party files a bankruptcy or insolvency petition which is not dismissed within days of the filing 
the three year research program to identify additional hdac inhibitors from topotarget s library can be terminated by either party upon a change in control of the other party or an uncured material breach in connection with the research program  and by curagen after the first year upon payment of a penalty equal to of the unexpended research funding or without penalty if it becomes apparent that a commercially viable future product is unlikely to be identified 

table of contents seattle genetics in june  we announced the licensing of seattle genetics proprietary adc technology for use with up to two of our fully human monoclonal antibodies 
we paid an upfront fee of million for access to the adc technology for use with cr  our first antibody program to utilize this technology 
in february  we also exercised our option to access seattle genetics adc technology for use with a second antibody program in exchange for a million payment 
seattle genetics adc technology employs synthetic  highly potent drugs that can be attached to antibodies with their proprietary linker systems 
the linkers are designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release the drug payload under specific conditions once inside target cells  thereby sparing non target cells many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy 
adcs can increase the therapeutic potential of the many antibodies with targeting ability but limited or no inherent cell killing activity 
under the terms of the multi year agreement  seattle genetics may receive up to million in milestone payments assuming successful development of two antibody therapeutics employing adc technology and will receive royalties on net sales of resulting products 
we are responsible for research  product development  manufacturing and commercialization of all products under this collaboration 
we also pay maintenance and material supply fees as well as research support payments for ongoing assistance provided by seattle genetics in developing adc products 
we may terminate any license under the agreement by providing not less than days prior written notice to seattle genetics 
in addition  either party can terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of contract by the other party with days written notice  or if either party files a bankruptcy or insolvency petition which is not dismissed within days of the filing 
other in addition to the above listed alliances  we have smaller  ongoing collaborative relationships with various pharmaceutical and biotech companies 
we have established relationships with more than universities  academic institutions  and individual companies to gain access to disease tissue samples  disease models  and select technologies 
we have successfully conducted research with  and have the potential to receive future milestones and royalties from companies including alexion pharmaceuticals  inc  biogen  dupont pioneer hi bred international  inc  gsk  genentech  roche and its affiliate  roche vitamins  inc and millennium pharmaceuticals  inc formerly cor therapeutics  inc at present  we do not consider these relationships either collectively or individually to be of a material nature 
company history we began operations in  when the massive undertaking to sequence the human genome was just beginning 
our strategy was based on discovering novel ways to combat disease through an understanding of how genes and their resulting proteins function within the human genome 
we developed an integrated genomics  proteomics and bioinformatics technology platform that has been used to analyze the human genome  disease models  marketed therapeutics and therapeutic candidates 
this approach has led to our discovery of hundreds of disease related genes  therapeutic targets and potential novel therapeutics 
our platform has been utilized by over a dozen biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
these collaborations helped validate our technology and have assisted us in developing our own proprietary pipeline of potential therapeutics 
we have focused our research efforts on three types of targets targets that encode protein therapeutics  targets amenable to antibody therapeutic development  and targets amenable to small molecule therapeutic development 
as our portfolio has grown  we have started developing protein therapeutics on our own  and transitioned our service based collaborations towards more strategic research and development alliances that would enable us to leverage the expertise and resources of industry leaders to turn our antibody and small molecule targets into therapeutics 
to that end  we established a strategic alliance with abgenix for the development of fully human monoclonal antibodies against our proprietary targets  a strategic alliance with bayer around the development of small molecules directed against our targets in diabetes  a strategic alliance with topotarget around the development 
table of contents of small molecule hdac inhibitors for oncology and inflammatory diseases  and a collaboration with seattle genetics around the development of adc products against our proprietary targets 
as our pipeline has matured over the past few years  we have decreased our early stage target discovery efforts and increased resources for the advancement of our pipeline of protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics into clinical development 
today  we remain one of the leading genomics based pharmaceutical companies in the industry with two phase ii products in oncology  a phase i fully human monoclonal antibody for kidney inflammation and a pipeline of protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics 
technology we have assembled a comprehensive  proprietary  and large scale platform to understand the human genome and have laid the groundwork to better understand the biology behind disease 
using this foundation  we prioritized promising programs from what we believe to be the remaining intervention points appropriate for the development of novel therapeutics 
we identify pharmaceutically relevant genes and proteins and associate them with specific diseases through biological methods that include hypothesis driven disease models  drug response models  gene and pathway mining approaches  and human genetics 
we are developing a pipeline of protein  antibody  and small molecule therapeutics in the areas of oncology  inflammatory diseases  and diabetes 
we have used our proprietary technology to identify the pharmaceutically tractable genome ptg 
the ptg is the subset of human genes that we believe will make suitable therapeutic targets either because they are proteins that are shed in the blood and can be targeted by protein and antibody therapeutics  sit on cell surfaces and make suitable antibody and small molecule therapeutics  or belong to intracellular classes of proteins that can be modulated by small molecules 
we have identified the roughly  genes that make up the ptg and have used this foundation to systematically determine which are the most promising ones to develop as therapeutic candidates 
we have established disease programs for the identification of novel  pharmaceutically relevant targets and the association of these targets with specific diseases through process driven and hypothesis driven scientific strategies 
once associated with diseases  potential therapeutic target candidates are validated through cellular assays and animal model systems 
information resulting from these efforts is comprehensively managed through our bioinformatics system which is composed of tools and databases that have been designed specifically to manage  organize  and analyze this complementary biological information 
we have used our technologies to complete the world s first comprehensive protein interaction map for a multicellular organism  drosophila melanogaster 
that achievement was featured on the cover of and published in the december  edition of science 
we also were the first to complete a proteomics map of a eukaryotic organism  yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae 
that achievement was featured on the cover of and published in the february  edition of nature 
in addition  we have a proprietary set of human protein protein interaction data 
insight into the highly complex pathways of model organisms protein protein interactions  combined with our proprietary knowledge of human protein protein interactions  enhances our ability to select promising novel targets for drug development and continues to support our preclinical and clinical development efforts 
competition we are subject to significant competition from organizations that are pursuing strategies  approaches  technologies and products that are similar to our own 
many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities and marketing capabilities 
in addition  research in the field of drug development is highly competitive 
our competitors include biotechnology companies  pharmaceutical companies  
table of contents academic and research institutions  and government agencies 
we compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that develop  produce and market therapeutic compounds in the us  europe and elsewhere 
we face competition from a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with products in preclinical development  clinical trials or approved for conditions identical or similar to the ones we are pursuing 
other companies and institutions engaged in research and development we face intense competition from include amgen  inc  genentech  inc  gloucester pharmaceuticals  inc  human genome sciences  inc  merck co  inc  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc  novartis  inc  major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  and universities and other research institutions 
the competition listed above was selected based upon identifying those companies that we feel have business models  are developing drugs or have drugs approved for therapeutic indications that are similar to the ones we are pursuing 
a number of our competitors are attempting to rapidly identify and patent genes and gene fragments sequenced at random  typically without specific knowledge of the function of such genes or gene fragments 
if our competitors discover or characterize important genes or gene fragments before we do  it could adversely affect any of our related disease research programs 
in addition  a number of competitors are producing proteins from genes and claiming both the proteins as potential therapeutics as well as claiming antibodies against these proteins 
in many cases generic antibody claims are being issued by the united states patent and trademark office uspto even though competitors have not actually made antibodies against the protein of interest  or do not have cellular  animal  or human data to support the use of these antibodies as therapeutics 
these claims on proteins as therapeutics and such claims covering all antibodies against the proteins and methods of use in broad human indications are being filed at a rapid rate  and some number of these claims have issued and may continue to issue 
we expect that competition in genomics research will intensify as technical advances are made and become more widely known 
intellectual property our business and competitive position depend on our ability to protect our genomic technologies  gene sequences  the proteins they encode  antibodies raised against them  small molecules  other products  information systems and proprietary databases  software and other methods and technology 
we continually file patent applications for our proprietary methods and devices for sequencing  gene expression analysis  discovery of biological pathways and drug screening and development 
as of the date of this report  we had been issued approximately patents with respect to aspects of our gene portfolio  products  processes and technologies 
in  the uspto issued new guidelines for patent applications reflecting its current policy regarding statutory written description and utility requirements for patentability 
the implementation of these new guidelines may cause the uspto initially to reject some of our pending new gene and protein patent applications 
although we believe that we will overcome such rejections to any of our new gene and protein 
table of contents cases  there is no guarantee that the uspto will approve them 
we strive especially to gain issued patents for our commercially important genes and proteins 
the new guidelines are not expected to impact pending cases directed to technology platforms

additionally  will continue scaling its technology to analyze larger model organisms  including human dna  and develop other genomic applications 

table of contents the operations of are run by a separate management team and governed by a board of directors made up of members of our management team and board of directors 
has also established a scientific advisory board that is comprised of an elite group of scientists in the fields of whole genome sequencing  infectious disease  human genetics  chemical engineering and bioinformatics 
as this new technology is commercialized and its applications become accepted across the life sciences industry  we anticipate that will contribute revenue and value to the consolidated entity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for segment reporting 
patents and licenses s products and services are based on the combination of several complex technologies 
has developed some of these technologies internally and has pursued patent protection in the us and other countries for certain developments  improvements  and inventions it has developed that are incorporated into s products or that fall within its fields of interest 
other of the technologies of interest to are owned by third parties and are used by under license 
the rights that considers important to its current business include patents or patent applications directed to nucleic acid sample preparation and amplification  as well as certain sequencing by synthesis approaches 
from time to time  third parties may assert that is infringing patents owned by such third parties 
will endeavor to settle such claims by mutual agreement on a satisfactory basis  which would result in withdrawal of the claim and or result in the granting of licenses to however  we cannot make any assurances as to the outcome of any future claims 
government regulation prior to the marketing of any new therapeutic developed by us  or by our collaborators  that new therapeutic must undergo an extensive regulatory review and approval process in the united states and other countries 
this regulatory process  which includes preclinical and clinical studies to establish a compound s safety and efficacy  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from such studies are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the process for new drug approval has many steps  including investigational new drug application 
after most of the pre clinical testing is completed  an ind is submitted to the fda before human testing of the drug may begin 
clinical studies may commence days after the fda has received the ind unless it objects within days 
all clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices  gcps 
in addition  an institutional review board  irb  at each hospital or clinic where the proposed studies will be conducted  must review and approve the study 
the irb also continues to monitor the study for any safety issues 
progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the fda 
in addition  the fda may  at any time during the day period or at any time thereafter  impose a clinical hold on proposed or ongoing clinical trials 
if the fda imposes a clinical hold  clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without fda authorization and then only under terms authorized by the fda 
in some instances  the ind application process can result in substantial delay and expense 
the ind must contain information  such as the results of pre clinical laboratory and animal experiments  information about the proposed clinical investigations  the chemical structure of the compound  or the sequence of a protein or antibody therapeutic  the mechanism by which it is believed to work in the human body  any toxic effects of the compound found in the animal studies  and how the compound  protein therapeutic or antibody therapeutic is manufactured 

table of contents clinical trials 
clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
they must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and requirements and under established protocols 
these protocols detail the objectives of the clinical trial  the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated 
the study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be approved by the institutional review board at each institution where the clinical trials are conducted 
clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process 
our studies are being conducted in the following manner phase i clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy human volunteers or patients afflicted with the therapeutic condition for which the investigational drug is being tested to determine an early safety and tolerability profile  including side effects associated with increasing doses  a maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics  phase ii clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with the therapeutic condition for which the investigational drug is being tested in order to determine potential efficacy preliminarily  and an expanded safety profile that identifies possible adverse effects  and phase iii clinical trials are large scale  geographically diverse  adequate and well controlled  conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to collect data to establish the safety and efficacy profile and assure compliance with the requirements of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
the fda  the study sponsor and the institutional review boards reviewing each clinical trial site closely monitor the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the united states 
they may change or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and their assessment of the relative risks and benefits to the patient 
new drug application 
after the completion of the clinical trial phases  and with input from the fda  a company prepares an nda for submission to the fda 
the nda must contain all of the information on the drug gathered to that date  including details on manufacturing and data from the clinical trials 
the fda does a preliminary review of all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an nda for filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the nda 
under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the fda has specified time frames in which to review the nda and respond to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission 
the fda may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
if fda evaluations of the nda and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda 
when and if those conditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
the fda may request additional studies phase iv to evaluate long term effects as a condition of approval 
if the fda s evaluation of the nda submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda may refuse to approve the nda or issue a not approvable letter 
phase iv clinical trials and post marketing studies 
in addition to studies requested by the fda after approval  additional studies are conducted to explore new indications 
the purpose of these trials and related publications is to broaden the application and use of the drug and its acceptance in the medical community 

table of contents approvals in european union eu 
in  the eu established a system for the registration of medicinal products in the eu and under that system  marketing authorization may be submitted at either a centralized or decentralized level 
the centralized procedure is administered by the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products 
this procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and is available at the applicant s option for other innovative products 
the centralized procedure provides  for the first time in the eu  for the granting of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all eu member states 
a mutual recognition procedure is available at the request of the applicant for all medicinal products that are not subject to the mandatory centralized procedure  under a decentralized procedure 
the decentralized procedure creates a new system for mutual recognition of national approvals and establishes procedures for coordinated eu action on product suspensions and withdrawals 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization for which mutual recognition is sought may submit an application to one or more member states  certifying that identical dossiers are being submitted to all member states for which recognition is sought 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each member state must decide whether or not to recognize the approval 
the procedure encourages member states to work with applicants and other regulatory authorities to resolve disputes concerning mutual recognition 
if such disputes cannot be resolved within the day period provided for review  the application will be subject to a binding arbitration procedure at the request of the applicant 
alternatively  the application may be withdrawn 
approvals outside of the united states and eu 
steps similar to those in the united states must be undertaken in virtually every other country comprising the market for our products before any such product can be commercialized in those countries 
the approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing 
there can be no assurance that approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the united states 
there can be no assurance that the resulting prices would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us 
regulatory status of our pipeline 
we are conducting clinical trials for cg  a potential protein therapeutic for the prevention of oral mucositis in cancer patients that are undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy  pxd  a potential small molecule hdac inhibitor for the treatment of advanced multiple myeloma  and cr  a fully human monoclonal antibody as a potential treatment to slow the progression of iga nephropathy and delay kidney failure in patients affected by the disease 
none of our product candidates have been approved for commercialization in the united states or elsewhere 
we  or any of our collaborators  may not be able to conduct clinical testing or obtain the necessary approvals from the fda or other regulatory authorities for some products 
failure by us  or our collaborators  to obtain required governmental approvals will delay or preclude our collaborators or us from marketing therapeutics or diagnostic products developed with us or limit the commercial use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in february  the fda granted us orphan drug designation on cg  for the treatment of radiation induced oral mucositis 
in november  the fda granted us orphan drug designation on cr  as a potential treatment to slow the progression of iga nephropathy and delay kidney failure in patients affected by the disease 
the orphan drug act of is intended to encourage companies to develop therapies for the treatment of diseases that affect fewer than  individuals in the united states at the time of application 
further criteria include the ability of the product to address an unmet medical need where no approved treatment option exists or to provide significant benefit over available treatments 
orphan drug designation  granted by the fda s office of orphan products development  provides us with a number of potential benefits for cg and cr orphan drug designation may result in seven years of market exclusivity in the united states upon fda product approval  provided that the sponsor company continues to meet certain conditions established by the fda 
upon marketing authorization and during the period of market exclusivity  the fda does not accept or approve other applications to market the same drug for the same therapeutic indication 
other incentives provided by orphan designation include protocol assistance and eligibility for research and development support 
protocol assistance includes regulatory assistance and reduced filing fees  as well as advice on the conduct of clinical trials 

table of contents in december  the fda granted us fast track status on cg  for the prevention of om in patients receiving hsct following myeloablative chemotherapy with or without tbi 
under the fda modernization act of  the fast track program facilitates interactions with the fda before and during the submission of a nda for therapeutics being investigated as a treatment of serious or life threatening diseases where there is an unmet medical need 
the fast track program enables a company to file an nda on a rolling basis as data becomes available 
this permits the fda to review the filing as it is received  rather than waiting for the entire document prior to commencing the review process 
with a fast track designation  there is an opportunity for more frequent interactions with the fda and the possibility of a priority review  which could decrease the typical review period

in january  we entered into a five year lease agreement for an additional  square foot research facility in branford to allow us to further our pipeline efforts 
also in  we executed three vacancy agreements for approximately  square feet of space at our new haven facility 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations or that suitable additional leased space will be available as needed 
our plans to construct a new corporate headquarters and protein production facility on the land we own in branford have been deferred  pending improvements in the external financing environment which would afford us the ability to finance the future construction costs

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a genomics based pharmaceutical development company dedicated to improving the lives of patients by developing novel protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics in the areas of oncology  inflammatory diseases  and diabetes 
our pipeline of therapeutics is based on targets from the human genome that we believe play a role in important mechanisms underlying disease 
we have taken a systematic approach to identifying and validating the most promising therapeutic targets from the human genome that are both applicable and amenable to drug development 
we use internal resources to develop our potential protein therapeutics and have established development alliances with abgenix  inc abgenix to support our antibody projects  bayer ag bayer to support small molecule projects for diabetes  topotarget a s topotarget to support small molecule histone deacetylase hdac inhibitor projects for oncology and inflammatory diseases  and seattle genetics  inc seattle genetics to support antibody drug conjugate projects 
as our pipeline has matured over the past few years  we have decreased our early stage target discovery efforts and focused our resources on the advancement of our pipeline of potential protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics through clinical development 
on october   we announced a corporate restructuring to focus on advancing our therapeutic pipeline through clinical development 
as part of this restructuring  we reprioritized our development programs and reduced our employee base by approximately people 
going forward  we plan to conserve resources and utilize our cash position to finance the development of products that have the highest potential for success 
in  we initiated a phase i trial on cg  which is being investigated as a potential protein therapeutic for the prevention of oral mucositis om in cancer patients that are undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
during  we continued to make progress on the development of cg for om  including the initiation of an additional phase i trial in cancer patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation 
in october  we announced the initiation of a phase ii trial on cg enrolling patients in a randomized  placebo controlled  multi center study to determine the safety and efficacy of a single dose of cg to prevent the development of clinically significant om 
approximately patients will be randomized to receive a single administration of either placebo or one of three dosages of cg immediately after bone marrow transplantation 
in december  data from our phase i trial on cg for cancer patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation was presented was presented at the th annual meeting of the american society of hematology 
of the patients presented in this poster  no serious drug related adverse events were noted following treatment with cg  and a total of of patients did not develop severe grade or om 
in february  we received orphan drug designation from the food and drug administration fda for cg in om  which we believe will help to strengthen the program by offering important clinical development and commercialization benefits 
in december  we received fast track status from the fda to investigate cg for the prevention of om in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following myeloablative chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation 
the fast track program enables a company to file a new drug application nda on a rolling basis as data becomes available and permits the fda to review the filing as it is received  rather than waiting for the entire document prior to commencing the review process 
with a fast track designation  there is an opportunity for more frequent interactions with the fda and the possibility of a priority review  which could decrease the typical review period 
in june  we added pxd  a novel hdac inhibitor  to our pipeline through a license and collaboration agreement with topotarget 
pxd is one of the most advanced hdac inhibitors in development and will be investigated as a potential treatment for both solid and hematologic cancers either alone  or in combination with other cancer drugs 
the collaboration with topotarget also provides us with access to their extensive library of hdac inhibitor candidates 
hdac inhibitors represent a new mechanistic class of anti cancer 
table of contents therapeutics that target hdac enzymes  and have been shown to arrest growth of cancer cells  induce apoptosis  or programmed cell death  promote differentiation  inhibit angiogenesis  and sensitize cancer cells to overcome drug resistance 
in august  we signed a clinical trials agreement with the national cancer institute nci that provides us with access to the expertise at the nci for the design  implementation  and monitoring of clinical trials with pxd under the agreement  the nci will sponsor several clinical trials evaluating the activity of pxd  either alone or in combination with other anti cancer therapies  for the treatment of solid and hematologic malignancies 
nci sponsored clinical trials will occur in parallel to those sponsored by curagen with all data generated available for use in future product registration 
data generated from two phase i clinical trials evaluating pxd in patients with solid tumors and hematologic cancers enabled us to initiate in january  a phase ii clinical trial on pxd for patients with advanced multiple myeloma 
in october  we announced that cr  our most advanced fully human monoclonal antibody stemming from our collaboration with abgenix  received clearance from the fda to be investigated as a potential treatment for iga nephropathy 
cr is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody with the potential to treat forms of kidney inflammation  such as iga nephropathy  that  if left untreated  could progress to kidney failure 
in november  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for cr as a potential treatment to slow the progression of iga nephropathy and delay kidney failure in patients affected by the disease  which we believe will help to strengthen the program by offering important clinical development and commercialization benefits 
a phase i trial with cr began in november to determine the maximum tolerated dose in healthy male volunteers 
in october  we announced the advancement of cr  a fully human monoclonal antibody drug conjugate  which we are investigating as a potential treatment for metastatic melanoma 
cr is the second fully human monoclonal antibody stemming from our collaboration with abgenix  and applies antibody drug conjugate technology that we licensed from seattle genetics 
we anticipate that cr will enter clinical trials during the first half of in october  we also announced the advancement of ct  an investigational small molecule drug for the potential management of adult onset type diabetes  which will be co developed with bayer 
this compound represents the first drug candidate to enter preclinical development from our ongoing collaboration with bayer that was established to identify and develop promising drugs for the treatment of diabetes based upon targets we discovered 
we anticipate that ct will enter clinical trials during the first half of in addition to cg  pxd  cr  cr  and ct we have several potential protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics currently being evaluated in animal studies or being prepared for animal studies 
these programs may lead to the filing of investigational new drug applications inds in the future 
to enable us to focus on our pipeline  we announced the formation of life sciences corporation in this majority owned subsidiary is commercializing novel nanoscale instrumentation and technologies for rapidly and comprehensively determining the nucleotide sequence of entire genomes whole genome sequencing 
s proprietary technology is expected to have widespread applications in industrial processes  agriculture  animal health  biodefense  and human health care  including drug discovery and development  and disease diagnosis 
scientists  using the technology platform  will be able to generate whole genome sequences for a wide variety of viral  bacterial and small fungi organisms 
in  will offer instrument systems and reagents to customers for high throughput sequencing without the need and complexity of large scale robotics 
additionally  will continue scaling its technology to analyze larger model organisms  including human dna  and develop other genomic applications 
we expect to generate value for our shareholders by developing therapeutics 
we expect to become profitable by commercializing a subset of therapeutics stemming from our development pipeline  and establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the co development and co commercialization of other therapeutics from our development pipeline 
our failure to successfully develop 
table of contents pharmaceutical products that we can commercialize would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
royalties or other revenue generated from commercial sales of products developed through the application of our technologies and expertise are not expected for several years  if at all 
we expect that our revenue or income sources for at least the next several years may be limited to payments under various collaboration agreements to the extent milestones are met  grant  service and product revenue  and interest income 
we expect to continue incurring substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on preclinical studies and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein  antibody and small molecule product candidates  external programs identified by our platform as being promising and synergistic with our products and expertise  and  as it continues work on the development and commercialization of its technology for whole genome analysis 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
we will incur substantial expenses for  and devote a significant amount of time to  these studies 
as a result  we expect to incur continued losses over the next several years  unless we are able to realize additional revenues under existing or new collaboration agreements or through s sales of genomic analysis services and or complete genomic analysis systems 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and may fluctuate 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the classifications used in all dollar amounts in tabular presentations are shown in millions  unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and as such  actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies and uses of estimates research and development expenses 
research and development costs have been our most significant costs to date and primarily include personnel costs  supplies and reagents  clinical trial related costs such as contractual services and manufacturing costs  perpetual license fees  depreciation of lab equipment and allocated facility costs 
such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
our research and development expenses also include accruals for clinical trial related costs such as contractual services and current manufacturing costs 
at each period end  we estimate the costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced  and we analyze the progress of these services based upon information received from the supplier when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be used in determining the related accruals in any accounting period 
actual results could differ significantly from our estimates under different assumptions 
revenue recognition 
we have entered into certain collaborative research agreements that provide for the partial or complete funding of specified projects in exchange for access to  and certain rights in  the data discovered under the related projects 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured  in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
collaboration revenue is recognized based upon defined metrics of completion  as outlined in the respective agreements  which includes percentage of completion  milestones  and 
table of contents project specific deliverables 
these metrics are reviewed internally each month to determine the work performed  deliverables met  and  if required  deliverables accepted by the collaborator 
deferred revenue arising from payments received under collaborative agreements is recognized as income when earned 
we have also entered into a collaborative research exchange agreement in which services and technology access are exchanged between the collaborative partner and us 
collaboration revenues and expenses under this exchange agreement included the fair value of the work performed by each collaborative partner

the increase in grant revenue for the year ended december  was a result of two federal grants awarded to in may and september from the national human genome research institute  one of the national institutes of health nih 
these grants will partially fund the continued scale up of s technology toward sequencing larger genomes 
each of these grants allowed to recover all expenses that were directly related to the research outlined in the grant award for days prior to the grant award date 
we expect grant revenue to increase in comparison to  as the research outlined in these two grants will be conducted for the entire fiscal year 
collaboration revenue 
the decrease in curagen s collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was primarily related to a decline in revenue recognized from various strategic alliances and 
table of contents in the volume of projects related to the bayer alliance during the fourth quarter of we expect that collaboration revenue will remain fairly constant as compared to  reflecting continued progress on the bayer alliance 
the increase in s collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was related to the sales of genomic analysis services as began to commercialize its sequencing platform 
we expect s collaboration revenue to continue to increase as continues to commercialize its platform 
additionally  we expect revenue from in from the sale of instrument systems and reagents 
grant research expenses 
the increase in grant research expenses for the year ended december  was a result of two federal grants awarded to in may and september from the nih  which will partially fund the scale up of s technology toward sequencing larger genomes 
grant research expenses for the first grant were recorded beginning in mid may and for the second grant beginning at the end of september the expenses included personnel costs and lab supplies that were directly related to the research outlined in the grant award 
we expect grant expenses to increase in comparison to  as the research outlined in these two grants will be conducted for the entire fiscal year 
research and development expenses 
the following table sets forth a comparison of research and development expenses by segment  for the years ended december  and change change research and development expenses curagen total research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits  supplies and reagents  contractual and manufacturing costs  perpetual license fees  depreciation and amortization  and allocated facility costs 
our research and development efforts are concentrated on four major project areas collaborations  preclinical drug candidates  clinical trials  and our majority owned subsidiary  with the exception of  we budget and monitor our research and development costs by expense category  rather than by project  because these costs often benefit multiple projects and or our technology platform 
below is a summary that reconciles our total research and development expenses for the years ended december  and by the major categories mentioned above change change salary and benefits supplies and reagents contractual and manufacturing costs perpetual license fees depreciation and amortization allocated facility costs total research and development expenses the increase in research and development expenses for curagen for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in contractual and manufacturing costs related to our preclinical studies and clinical trials  and perpetual license fee payments during the second quarter of of approximately million primarily related to the topotarget and seattle genetics collaborations  offset by a reduction in the first quarter 
table of contents of of prior year accruals related to payments subsequently determined to be no longer owed due to amended contract terms for the abgenix collaboration 
in addition  decreases in salary and benefits  and supplies and reagents  in connection with the october restructuring plan offset the overall increases in research and development expenses 
we anticipate an increase in research and development expenses during of to as compared to  primarily due to contractual services related to clinical trials and manufacturing  perpetual licensing fees  and milestone payments  primarily to topotarget 
the increase in research and development expenses for for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased personnel costs  lab supplies and reagents  and depreciation expense associated with developing a measurement service center and manufacturing capabilities in connection with the preparation for commercialization of s technology 
as soon as we start to conduct a phase i clinical trial for a potential therapeutic  we begin to track the direct research and development expenses associated with that clinical candidate 
the following table shows cumulative direct research and development expenses associated with each clinical candidate as of december  and therapeutic area and clinical candidate class cumulative clinical trial costs indication current trial status cancer supportive care cg protein prevention oral mucositis phase ii oncology pxd small molecule multiple myeloma solid tumors hematological malignancies phase ii phase i phase i kidney inflammation cr antibody iga nephropathy phase i currently  our potential pharmaceutical products require significant research and development efforts and preclinical testing  and will require extensive clinical trials prior to submitting an application to regulatory agencies for their commercial use 
although we are conducting human studies with respect to cg  pxd  and cr  we may not be successful in developing or commercializing these or other products 
our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and we cannot currently reliably estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
completion of research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials may take many years 
estimates of completion periods for any of our major research and development projects are highly speculative and variable  depending on the nature of the disease indication  how common it is among the general populace  and the results of the research 
for example  preclinical testing and clinical trials can often go on for an indeterminate period of time since the results of tests are continually monitored  with each test considered complete only when sufficient data has been accumulated to assess whether the next phases are warranted or whether the effort should be abandoned 
typically  phase i clinical trials are expected to last between and months  phase ii clinical trials are expected to last between and months and phase iii clinical trials are expected to last between and months 
the most significant time and costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and most comprehensive studies conducted during the drug development process 
in addition  many factors may delay the commencement and speed of completion of preclinical testing and clinical trials  including the number of patients participating in the trial  the duration of patient follow up 
table of contents required  the number of clinical sites at which the trials are conducted  and the length of time required to locate and enroll suitable patient subjects 
the successful completion of our development programs and the successful development of our product candidates are highly uncertain and are subject to numerous challenges and risks 
therefore  we cannot presently estimate anticipated completion dates for any of our projects  as described more fully in the risk factors section under the heading risks related to our business 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product candidate  the uncertainties related to the cost of projects and our ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
if our major research and development projects are delayed  then we can expect to incur additional costs in conducting our preclinical testing and clinical trials and a longer period of time before we become profitable from our operating activities  as described more fully in the risk factors section under the headings we have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses in the future and we may need to raise additional funding  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
accordingly  the timing of the potential market approvals for our existing product candidates  cg  pxd  cr  and future product development candidates  may have a significant impact on our capital requirements 
asset impairment expense 
during the third quarter of  we had an independent market value appraisal performed on the land we own in branford  connecticut 
this property is being held for the possible future construction of a corporate headquarters and protein production facility  although plans have been deferred  pending improvements in the external financing environment which would afford us the ability to finance the future construction costs 
at september   the appraised market value of the property was below the holding value 
therefore  an asset impairment expense of million was recorded in the third quarter of in order to properly reflect the estimate of the fair value of the property in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  remained constant as compared to general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease by approximately during as compared to  as a result of the recent corporate restructuring and lower legal patent costs 
restructuring and related charges 
restructuring and related charges of approximately million were incurred in the fourth quarter of as a part of our october corporate restructuring plan 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we incurred million related to employee separation costs and million of asset impairment costs 
the employee separation costs were recorded under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas and included amounts to be paid for severance and related benefits  the services for which had been performed in full as of the end of the cash requirements under the october restructuring plan were million  of which million was paid prior to december  the remaining cash requirements of million will be paid through june interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to the utilization of cash and investment balances in the normal course of operations and the repurchase of million of our convertible subordinated debentures due in  as well as lower yields in our investment portfolio  offset by the receipt of net proceeds of approximately million from our convertible subordinated notes due in we earned an average yield of in as compared to in in  we expect the yields in our investment portfolio to be slightly higher than however  due to the utilization of cash and investments balances in the normal course of operations  we anticipate interest income to decrease by approximately to million in in the event that during we use cash to repay a portion of our remaining existing debt due in  our estimate of the size of anticipated decrease in interest income for will differ accordingly 

table of contents interest expense 
we expect interest expense to be approximately million during  primarily attributable to the interest paid semi annually to the holders of our million convertible subordinated debentures due in  and our million convertible subordinated notes due in in the event that during we use cash to repay a portion of our remaining existing debt due in  our estimate of interest expense will differ accordingly 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in february  we repurchased million of our convertible subordinated debentures due in  for total consideration of million  plus accrued interest of million to the date of repurchase 
as a result of the transaction we recorded a loss of approximately million in loss on extinguishment of debt  due to the write off of the ratable portion of unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the repurchased debt 
income tax benefit 
we recorded an income tax benefit during as a result of connecticut legislation  which allows companies to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut at a rate of of their annual research and development expense credit  in exchange for forgoing carryforward of the research and development credit 
for the year ended december   the increase in the income tax benefit was a result of the expiration of the state of connecticut statute  as it relates to the year income tax benefit 
we expect the income tax benefit to be consistent with before the adjustment to reflect the statute expiration  as qualified expenses are expected to remain relatively constant as compared to minority interest in subsidiary loss 
minority interest in subsidiary loss for the year ended december  which is the portion of s loss attributable to shareholders of other than us remained relatively consistent with the same period in during  losses attributed to the minority ownership in are expected to decrease to to million  as begins selling instruments and reagents as well as increasing their sequencing services 
in the event that during the cumulative losses applicable to the minority interest in subsidiary exceed the minority interest in the equity capital of  all further losses applicable to the minority interest will be charged to curagen 
the following table sets forth a comparison of the components of our net loss for the years ended december  and in millions change change collaboration revenue research and development expenses general and administrative expenses restructuring and related charges interest income interest expense income tax benefit minority interest in subsidiary loss net loss collaboration revenue 
the decrease in collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was primarily a result of a decline in revenue recognized from the abgenix strategic alliance 
also reflected in the decrease was the on going change in our business strategy  to establish strategic research and development alliances with companies for the co development and co commercialization of therapeutics from our development pipeline  rather than focusing on short term revenue generating service based collaborations 
in addition  during the setup phase of the bayer alliance was completed and we received a related milestone payment  resulting in a transition to the production phase of that alliance 

table of contents research and development expenses 
the following table sets forth a comparison of research and development expenses by segment  for the years ended december  and change change research and development expenses curagen total research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits  supplies and reagents  contractual and manufacturing costs  depreciation and amortization  and allocated facility costs 
our research and development efforts are concentrated on four major project areas collaborations  preclinical drug candidates  clinical trials  and our majority owned subsidiary  with the exception of  we budget and monitor our research and development costs by expense category  rather than by project  because these costs often benefit multiple projects and or our technology platform 
below is a summary that reconciles our total research and development expenses for the years ended december  and by the major categories mentioned above change change salary and benefits supplies and reagents contractual and manufacturing costs depreciation and amortization allocated facility costs total research and development expenses the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to implementation of corporate restructuring plans in late and mid  intended to reduce overall costs and focus resources on prioritizing  selecting and advancing our most promising product candidates 
as soon as we start to conduct a phase i clinical trial for a potential therapeutic  we begin to track the direct research and development costs associated with that clinical candidate 
as of december   we had incurred approximately million of direct research and development expenses related to our initial clinical candidate  cg  for which we received fda clearance to commence a phase i clinical trial for oral mucositis in march general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to the implementation of corporate restructuring plans 
additionally  lower intellectual property expenses are indicative of the shift in our focus from early stage discovery efforts to the advancement of our therapeutic development efforts 
restructuring and related charges 
restructuring and related charges of approximately million were incurred in the second quarter of as a part of our june corporate restructuring plan which was intended to focus resources on continuing to advance our pipeline of therapeutics into preclinical and clinical development 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we incurred million related to employee separation costs  million of operating lease obligations and million of asset impairment costs 
the employee separation costs were recorded under sfas and included amounts to be paid for severance and related benefits  the services for which had been performed in full as of the end of the second quarter of the cash requirements under the june restructuring plan were million  of which million were paid prior to december  the remaining cash requirements at december  and of million and million  respectively  will be paid through the end of 
table of contents interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to lower yields in our investment portfolio and a decrease in cash and investment balances during we earned an average yield of in as compared to in income tax benefit 
we recorded the income tax benefit as a result of connecticut legislation  which allowed companies to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut at a rate of of their annual research and development expense credit  in exchange for forgoing the credit carryforward 
for the year ended december   the income tax benefit decrease was a result of the decline in various expenses which qualified for the annual research and development credit as a result of the corporate restructuring plan  primarily personnel costs  supplies and reagents  and intellectual property expenses 
in addition  due to s focus on revenues to be realized in the short term  elected not to request a cash refund for  but instead elected to continue to carry forward the credit 
minority interest in subsidiary loss 
minority interest in subsidiary loss for the year ended december  which is the portion of s loss attributable to shareholders of other than us increased primarily due to s additional efforts to advance its technology 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through convertible subordinated debt offerings  public equity offerings  private placements of equity securities  revenues received under our collaborative research agreements and government grants  and exercises of stock options 
in february  we completed an offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due february   and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  in march  the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase an additional million of convertible subordinated notes due february   providing us with additional net proceeds of approximately million 
also in february  we repurchased million of our convertible subordinated debentures due in  for total consideration of million  plus accrued interest of million to the date of repurchase 
as of december   we had recognized million of cumulative sponsored research revenues from collaborative research agreements and government grants 
at december   our gross investment in lab and office equipment  computers  land and leasehold improvements was million 
since inception  we have not had any off balance sheet arrangements 
to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
received two federal grants during  for specific purposes that are subject to review and audit by the grantor agencies 
such audits could lead to requests for reimbursement by the grantor agency for any expenditures disallowed under the terms of the grant 
additionally  any noncompliance with the terms of the grant could lead to loss of current or future awards 

table of contents cash and investments 
the following table depicts the components of our operating  investing and financing activities for the year ended december   using the direct cash flow method cash received from collaborators cash received from grantor cash paid to suppliers and employees restructuring and related charges paid interest income received interest expense paid net cash and investments used in operating activities cash paid to acquire property and equipment  net of sales proceeds cash paid to acquire intangible assets convertible loan to collaborator net cash and investments used in investing activities cash paid for principal portion of capital leases cash received from employee stock option exercises cash received from issuance of convertible debt  net of financing costs cash paid for extinguishment of debt net cash and investments provided by financing activities unrealized loss on marketable securities net decrease in cash and investments cash and investments  beginning of period cash and investments  end of period in accordance with our investment policy  we are utilizing the following investment objectives for cash and investments investment decisions are made with the expectation of minimum risk of principal loss  even with a modest penalty in yield  appropriate cash balances and related short term funds are maintained for immediate liquidity needs  and appropriate liquidity is available for medium term cash needs  and maximum yield is achieved 
future liquidity 
during the next twelve months  we expect to continue to fund our operations through a combination of the following sources cash and investment balances  collaboration revenue  interest income  grant revenue  instrument system and reagent sales  potential public securities offerings  and or private strategic driven common stock offerings 
we also plan to continue making substantial investments to advance our preclinical and clinical drug pipeline  as well as commercializing s genomic analysis technology 
in that regard  we foresee the following as significant uses of liquidity personnel costs  supplies and reagents  contractual services related to clinical trials and manufacturing  perpetual licensing fees  potential milestone payments  legal expenses in support of the continued protection of our intellectual property portfolio  costs related to  as they continue to commercialize and develop new technologies for whole genome analysis  external programs identified by our platform as being promising and synergistic with our products and expertise  cost sharing of expenses with bayer related to ct preclinical development  in which both parties will jointly fund the relevant preclinical research  development and commercialization activities  and capital expenditures during the first quarter of  primarily for the expansion of our existing protein production laboratory facilities 
in addition  we expect the payments of interest to the holders of our convertible subordinated debt due in and in to be a continued significant use of liquidity 
depending on market and other conditions  from time to time  we may repurchase a portion of the existing convertible subordinated debentures due in open market purchases  in privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
in addition  we also may use sources of liquidity for working capital  general corporate purposes 
table of contents and potentially for future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and extent of our acquisitions  our product development activities  our investments in technology and the amount of cash generated by our operations 
actual expenditures may vary substantially from our estimates 
our failure to use sources of liquidity effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our requirements for the next twenty four months 
our operating and capital expenditures are considered to be crucial to our future success  and by continuing to make strategic investments in our preclinical and clinical drug pipeline  we believe that we are building substantial value for our shareholders 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements  including the repayment of our remaining million of convertible subordinated debentures due february  and our million of convertible subordinated notes due february   will depend on many factors 
these factors include the number  breadth and progress of our research  product development and clinical programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products  potential future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies  in licensing of pharmaceutical products  and costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
while we will continue to explore alternative sources for financing our business activities  including the possibility of public securities offerings and or private strategic driven common stock offerings  we cannot be certain that in the future these sources of liquidity will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in appropriate strategic situations  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contributions by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development and testing of products under development 
however  should we be unable to obtain future financing either through the methods described above or through other means  we may be unable to meet the critical objective of our long term business plan  which is to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products  and may be unable to continue operations 
this result could cause our shareholders to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations  along with our future commitments related to all contracts that we are likely to continue  regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  anticipated actions by third parties  progress of our clinical programs and other factors

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
purchase obligations for supplies and reagents are not included in the table above  as our purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current operating needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time periods 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies and reagents specifying minimum quantities or set prices 
in addition  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and are not included above

these forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements  therefore  should be considered in light of all of the information included or referred to in this report  including the cautionary information set forth under the heading risk factors below 
we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise  unless required by law 

table of contents risk factors risks related to our business because our business strategy is still largely untested  we do not know whether we will be able to commercialize any of our products or to what extent we will generate revenue or become profitable 
we do not know whether we can implement our business strategy successfully because we are in the early stages of development 
initially  we set out to find as many genes and their related functions as possible and are now using that information to develop our own therapeutic products 
this strategy is largely untested 
other companies first target particular diseases and try to find cures for them  have a limited number of genes and proteins of potential therapeutic interest  or rely on other more proven strategies 
if our strategy does not result in the development of products that we can commercialize  we will be unable to generate revenue 
we have not completed development of any product based on our genomics research 
although we have three products being investigated in clinical trials  we cannot be certain that these or any future products will receive marketing approval 
if we are unable to commercialize products  we may not be able to recover our investment in our product development efforts 
because clinical trials for our products will be expensive and protracted and their outcome is uncertain  we must invest substantial amounts of time and money that may not yield viable products 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product  we must demonstrate through laboratory  animal and human studies that such product is both effective and safe for use in humans 
we will incur substantial expense for  and devote a significant amount of time to  these studies 
completion of clinical trials may take many years 
the length of time required varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
the fda monitors the progress of each phase of testing  and may require the modification  suspension  or termination of a trial if it is determined to present excessive risks to patients 
our rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors  including our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  our inability to identify  enroll and initiate sites to conduct clinical trials  variability in the number and types of patients available for each study  as well as the difficulty in enrolling patients in each study  difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment  resulting in incomplete data  unforeseen safety issues or side effects  poor efficacy or unanticipated adverse effects of products during the clinical trials  institutional review board delays at institutions assisting us with our clinical trials  and government or regulatory delays 
studies that we conduct  or studies which third parties conduct on our behalf  may not demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and safety to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for these or any other potential products 
regulatory authorities may not permit us to undertake any additional clinical trials 
the clinical trial process may be accompanied by substantial delay and expense and there can be no assurance that the data generated in these studies ultimately will be sufficient for marketing approval by the fda 
we have three products in clinical development and our other products are in preclinical development 
none of these products may demonstrate sufficient effectiveness or safety to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals required for initiation or continuation of clinical studies or obtaining marketing approval 

table of contents because we have limited experience in developing  commercializing and marketing products  we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to do so 
currently  we are developing several potential pharmaceutical products  and such products will require significant research and development and preclinical testing  and will require extensive clinical testing prior to our submitting any regulatory application for their commercial use 
although we are conducting human studies with respect to three products  we have limited experience with these activities and may not be successful in developing or commercializing these or other products 
these activities  if undertaken without the collaboration of others  will require the expenditure of significant funds 
such potential pharmaceutical products will be subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products based on new technologies 
before we can commercialize a product  we must rigorously test the product in the laboratory and complete extensive human studies 
even if we complete such studies  our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on our ability to complete laboratory testing and human studies  obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products  obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals related to the efficacy and safety of our products  enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture our products on our behalf  and deploy sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these functions 
as a result of these possibilities  we may not be able to develop through our research and development activities any commercially viable products 
we cannot be certain that expenses for testing and study will yield profitable products or even products approved for marketing by the fda 
if we are not successful in identifying products that we can develop commercially  we may be unable to recover the large investment we have made in research  development and manufacturing 
in addition  should we choose to develop pharmaceutical products internally  we will have to make significant investments in pharmaceutical product development  marketing  sales and regulatory compliance resources  and we will have to establish or contract for the manufacture of products under the current good manufacturing practices cgmps of the fda 
any potential products developed by our licensees will be subject to the same risks 
we do not have any marketed products 
if we develop products that can be marketed  we intend to market the products either independently or together with collaborators or strategic partners 
if we decide to market any products independently  we will incur significant additional expenditures and commit significant additional management resources to establish a sales force 
for any products that we market together with partners  we will rely  in whole or in part  on the marketing capabilities of those parties 
we may also contract with third parties to market certain of our products 
ultimately  we and our partners may not be successful in marketing our products 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture and supply critical components of our development and clinical programs 
currently  we contract with third party manufacturers or develop products with partners and use the partners manufacturing capabilities 
as we use others to manufacture our products  we depend on those parties to comply with cgmps  and other regulatory requirements and to deliver materials on a timely basis 
these parties may not perform adequately 
any failures by these third parties may delay our development of products or the submission of these products for regulatory approval 
we depend on third party research organizations to design and conduct our laboratory testing and human studies 
if we are unable to obtain any necessary services on acceptable terms  we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely manner 
as we rely on third parties for laboratory testing and human studies  we may lose some control over these activities and become too dependent upon these parties 
these third parties may not complete testing activities or human studies on schedule or when we request 

table of contents because neither we nor any of our collaborative partners have received marketing approval for any product resulting from our research and development efforts  and may never be able to obtain any such approval  we may not be able to generate any product revenue 
all the products being developed by our collaborative partners will require additional research and development  extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales 
in some cases  the length of time that it takes for our collaborative partners to achieve various regulatory approval milestones may affect the payments that we are eligible to receive under our collaboration agreements 
we and our collaborative partners may need to address a number of technical challenges successfully in order to complete development of our products 
moreover  these products may not be effective in treating any disease or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use 
we may be unable to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of our products and ensure their proper performance and quality 
biopharmaceuticals must be produced under the cgmps of the fda 
we do not have facilities capable of manufacturing drug products under cgmps and must outsource any such production 
we are devoting resources to establishing our own manufacturing capabilities to support development and preclinical activities and are contracting with third party vendors for the manufacture of materials for use in humans 
we may be unable to contract successfully for cgmps manufacture of any products and may be unable to obtain required quantities of our products economically 
we may not be able to obtain capacity to produce a sufficient amount of commercial product to meet our clinical development and commercial needs 
failure to meet the demand for product may adversely affect our ability to continue to market the product 
compliance with government regulation is critical to our business and failure to satisfy regulatory requirements could impair our business 
prior to the marketing of any new drug developed by us  or by our collaborators  that new drug must undergo an extensive regulatory review process in the united states and other countries 
this regulatory process  which includes preclinical and clinical studies  as well as post marketing surveillance to establish a compound s safety and efficacy  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from such studies are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
even if the fda allows clinical testing of our products  we will still need to obtain institutional review board approval for each site participating in a clinical study  which may involve additional delays 
the rate of completion of clinical trials depends upon  among other factors  the enrollment of patients 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including availability of fda approved therapies or interventions  timing and restriction of institutional review board approval  the size of the patient population  proximity of patients to clinical sites  eligibility criteria for the study  time commitment of a patient to the study  and existence of competitive clinical trials 
we have not had any of our product candidates receive approval for commercialization in the united states or elsewhere 
neither we nor our collaborators may be able to conduct clinical testing or obtain the necessary approvals from the fda or other regulatory authorities for any products 
failure by us or our collaborators to obtain required governmental approvals will delay or preclude our collaborators or us from marketing drugs developed 
table of contents with us or limit the commercial use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even where a product is exempted from fda clearance or approval  the fda may impose restrictions as to the types of customers to which we can market and sell our products 
such restrictions may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the fda may condition marketing approval on the conduct of specific post marketing studies to further evaluate safety and efficacy 
rigorous and extensive fda regulation of pharmaceutical products continues after approval  particularly with respect to compliance with cgmps reporting of adverse effects  advertising  promotion and marketing 
discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions  any of which could materially adversely affect our business 
we must obtain regulatory approval by governmental agencies in other countries prior to commercialization of our products in those countries 
foreign regulatory systems may be just as rigorous  costly and uncertain as in the united states 
we rely significantly on our collaborative partners  and our business could be harmed if we are unable to maintain strategic alliances 
as part of our business strategy  we have strategic research and development alliances with companies to gain access to specific technologies 
these alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may provide us with access to unique technologies  access to capital  near term revenues  milestone and or royalty payments  and potential profit sharing arrangements 
in return  we provide access to unique technologies  expertise in genomics  and information on the molecular basis of disease  drug targets  and drug candidates 
to date  we have entered into significant strategic alliances with abgenix  bayer  topotarget and seattle genetics  in addition to numerous smaller agreements to facilitate these efforts 
in these strategic alliances  either party can terminate the agreement at any time the alliance permits them to or if either party materially breaches the contract 
we may not be able to maintain or expand existing alliances or establish any additional alliances 
if any of our existing collaborators were to breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct activities successfully and in a timely manner  the preclinical or clinical development or commercialization of product candidates or research programs may be delayed or terminated 
we depend on attracting and retaining key employees 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  including jonathan m 
rothberg  phd  our chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board  david m 
wurzer  executive vice president and chief financial officer  christopher k 
mcleod  executive vice president and interim chief executive officer and president at  and timothy m 
shannon  md  executive vice president and chief medical officer 
the loss of services of any of these personnel could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we entered into employment agreements with all of the principal members of our management team 
we maintain key person life insurance on the life of dr 
rothberg in the amount of million 
our future success also will depend in part on the continued services of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to attract  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for such qualified personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could materially  adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on academic collaborators  consultants and scientific advisors 
we have relationships with collaborators and consultants at academic and other institutions who conduct research at our request 
these collaborators and consultants are not our employees 
substantially all of our collaborators and consultants are employed by employers other than us and may have commitments to  or 
table of contents consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
as a result  we have limited control over their activities and  except as otherwise required by our collaboration and consulting agreements  can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities 
our ability to discover genes and biological pathways involved in human disease  explore and validate biological activity of therapeutic candidates and commercialize products based on those discoveries may depend in part on continued collaborations with researchers at academic and other institutions 
we may not be able to negotiate additional acceptable collaborations with collaborators or consultants at academic and other institutions 
our academic collaborators  consultants and scientific advisors may have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which could compete with us 
our academic collaborators  consultants and scientific advisors sign agreements which provide for confidentiality of our proprietary information and of the results of studies 
we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with every academic collaboration or advisory arrangement  and any unauthorized dissemination of our confidential information could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  any such collaborator  consultant or advisor may enter into an employment agreement or consulting arrangement with one of our competitors 
competition in our field is intense and likely to increase 
we are subject to significant competition from organizations that are pursuing strategies  approaches  technologies and products that are similar to our own 
many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities and marketing capabilities 
in addition  research in the field of drug development is highly competitive 
our competitors include biotechnology companies  pharmaceutical companies  academic and research institutions  and government agencies 
we compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that develop  produce and market therapeutic compounds in the us  europe and elsewhere 
we face competition from a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with products in preclinical development  clinical trials or approved for conditions identical or similar to the ones we are pursuing 
other companies engaged in research and development we face intense competition from include amgen  inc  genentech  inc  gloucester pharmaceuticals  inc  human genome sciences  inc  merck co  inc  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc  novartis  inc  major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  and universities and other research institutions 
the competition listed above was selected based upon identifying those companies that we feel have business models  are developing drugs or have drugs approved for therapeutic indications that are similar to the ones we are pursuing 

table of contents a number of organizations are attempting to rapidly identify and patent genes and gene fragments sequenced at random  typically without specific knowledge of the function of such genes or gene fragments 
if our competitors discover or characterize important genes or gene fragments before we do  it could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products 
we expect that competition in genomics research  protein therapeutics  and therapeutic antibodies will intensify as technical advances are made and become more widely known 
in addition  a number of competitors are producing proteins from genes and claiming both the proteins as potential therapeutics as well as claiming antibodies against these proteins 
in many cases generic antibody claims are being issued by the united states patent and trademark office uspto even though competitors have not actually made antibodies against the protein of interest  or do not have cellular  animal  or human data to support the use of these antibodies as therapeutics 
these claims on proteins as therapeutics and these claims covering all antibodies against the proteins and methods of use in broad human indications are being filed at a rapid rate  and some number of these claims have issued and may continue to issue 
in addition  purified proteins  therapeutic data  and antibodies  including polyclonal antibodies  mouse monoclonal antibodies and  in some cases  fully human monoclonal antibodies  are being generated against a large number of targets within the human genome 
all of these activities may make it difficult to commercialize products  or  if licenses are made available  may make the royalty burden on these products so high as to prevent commercial success 
we may engage in acquisitions that are unsuccessful 
in the future  we may engage in acquisitions in order to exploit technology or market opportunities 
we are not experienced in acquiring and integrating new businesses 
if we acquire another company  we may not be able to integrate the acquired business successfully into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner or at all 
furthermore  an acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipate 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital management and other resources spent on an acquisition that fails to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions can involve material non recurring charges and amortization of significant amounts of non cash acquisition costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 
if our patent applications do not result in issued patents  then our competitors may obtain rights to commercialize our discoveries 
our business and competitive position depends on our ability to protect our products  processes and technologies 
we continually file patent applications for our proprietary methods  novel uses of genes  and our development products 
as of the date of this report  we had been issued approximately patents with respect to aspects of our gene portfolio  products  processes and technologies 
our commercial success also depends in part on obtaining patent protection on genes and proteins for which we or our collaborators discover utility and on products  methods and services based on such discoveries 
we have applied for patent protection on novel genes and proteins  novel mutants of known genes and their uses  partial sequences of novel proteins and their gene sequences and uses  and novel uses for previously identified genes discovered by third parties 
we have applied for patents on antibodies against the proteins we have discovered  as well as seek or have our partners seek patent protection on the antibodies we produce against these proteins 
we have sought and intend to continue to seek patent protection for novel uses for genes and proteins and therapeutic antibodies that may have been patented by third parties 
in such cases  we would need a license from the holder of the patent with respect to such gene or protein in order to make  use or sell such gene or protein for such use 
we may not be able to acquire such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our patent application filings that result from the identification of genes associated with the cause or effect of a particular disease generally seek to protect the genes and the proteins encoded by such genes as well as antibodies raised against these gene products 
we also seek patent protection for our therapeutic  diagnostic and drug screening methods and products 

table of contents in  the uspto issued new guidelines for patent applications reflecting the uspto s current policy regarding statutory written description and utility requirements for patentability 
the implementation of these new guidelines may cause the uspto initially to reject some of our pending new gene and protein patent applications 
there is no guarantee that the uspto will approve them 
we strive especially to gain issued patents for our commercially important genes and proteins 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including us  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
our patent applications may not protect our products  processes and technologies because of the following reasons there is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in additional issued patents  we may develop additional proprietary technologies that are not patentable  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will provide a basis for commercially viable products  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will provide us with any competitive advantages  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will not be challenged or circumvented or invalidated by third parties  and there is no guarantee that any patents issued to others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
in addition  patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies  duplicate any of our technologies  or  if patents are issued to us  design around the patented technologies developed by us 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend ourselves in patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate such suits 
the issuance of patents may not provide us with sufficient protection 
we may not be able to obtain further patents for our products  processes and technologies  or  if we are able to obtain further patents  these patents may not provide us with substantial protection or be commercially beneficial 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability  nor does it provide the patent holder with freedom to operate without infringing the patent rights of others 
a patent could be challenged by litigation and  if the outcome of such litigation were adverse to the patent holder  competitors could be free to use the subject matter covered by the patent  or the patent holder may license the technology to others in settlement of such litigation 
the invalidation of key patents owned by or licensed to us or non approval of pending patent applications could increase competition  and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any application or exploitation of our technology could infringe patents or proprietary rights of others and any licenses that we might need as a result of such infringement might not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
third parties have indicated to us that they believe we may be required to obtain a license in order to perform certain processes that we use in the conduct of our business or in order to market potential drugs we have in development 
we cannot predict whether our or our competitors pending patent applications will result in the issuance of valid patents 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us  also may be necessary to enforce our patent and proprietary rights and or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
we may participate in interference proceedings that may in the future be declared by the uspto to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost to us 
the outcome of any such litigation or interference proceeding might not be favorable to us  and we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require or that  if obtainable  we could license such technology at a reasonable cost 

table of contents the public availability of genomic sequence information or other sequence information prior to the time we apply for patent protection on a corresponding full length or partial gene could adversely affect our ability to obtain patent protection with respect to such gene or gene sequences 
in addition  certain other groups are attempting to rapidly identify and characterize genes through the use of gene expression analysis and other technologies 
to the extent any patents issue to other parties on such partial or full length genes or uses for such genes  the risk increases that the sale of potential products  including therapeutics  or processes developed by us or our collaborators may give rise to claims of patent infringement 
others may have filed and in the future are likely to file patent applications covering genes or gene products or antibodies against the gene products that are similar or identical to our products 
any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications 
any legal action against us or our collaborators claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected products and processes could  in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  require us or our collaborators to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes or could enjoin us from continuing to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
there can be no assurance that we or our collaborators would prevail in any such action or that any license required under any such patent would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we believe that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in such litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources 
there is substantial uncertainty concerning the extent to which supportive data will be required for issuance of patents for human therapeutics 
if data additional to that available to us is required  our ability to obtain patent protection could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected 
although the uspto issued new utility guidelines in that address the requirements for demonstrating utility for biotechnology inventions  particularly for inventions relating to human therapeutics  there can be no assurance that the uspto examiners will follow such guidelines or that the uspto s position will not change with respect to what is required to establish utility for gene sequences and products and methods based on such sequences 
we cannot be certain that our security measures will protect our proprietary technologies 
we also rely upon trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information that is not subject matter for which patent protection is being sought 
we have developed a database of proprietary gene expression patterns and biological pathways which we update on an ongoing basis and which can be accessed over the internet 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary technologies  processes  information systems and data and continue to explore ways to enhance such security 
such measures  however  may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
while we require employees  academic collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality and or non disclosure agreements where appropriate  any of the following could still occur proprietary information could be disclosed  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology  or we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
we depend upon our ability to license technologies 
we may have to acquire or license certain components of our technologies or products from third parties 
we may not be able to acquire from third parties or develop new technologies  either alone or with others 
failure to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the life sciences technology platform is in development and the initial stages of commercialization 
the technology platform of  our majority owned subsidiary see business life sciences corporation  is still in development and has not had significant sales of its services or products 
may not be able to continue to successfully develop or commercialize the technology platform 
the success of commercialization of the technology platform depends on many factors  including the acceptance of s technology in the market place  technical performance of s platform in relation to existing technologies  and s ability to obtain from suppliers key components for the manufacture of the instrument and reagents 
is subject to competition from organizations that have developed or are developing technologies and products to service s potential customers 
many of the organizations competing with potentially have greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities and marketing capabilities 
s potential competitors include applera corporation applied biosystems  affymetrix  inc  ge healthcare  perlegen sciences  inc  and other companies recently formed or soon to be funded to develop whole genome sequencing technologies 
we believe that the future success of will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position in instruments for the high throughput nucleic acid sequencing field 
before we recover development expenses for our products or technologies  such products or technologies may become obsolete as a result of technological developments by us or others 
our products could also be made obsolete by new technologies which are less expensive or more effective 
we may not be able to make the enhancements to our technology necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
a market for the high throughput nucleic acid sequencing field may not be sufficient to generate revenues significant enough for to achieve profitability 
patents may not provide sufficient protection for the technology 
s products and services are based on the combination of several complex technologies 
has developed some of these technologies internally and has pursued patent protection in the us and other countries for certain developments  improvements  and inventions it has developed that are incorporated into s products or that fall within its fields of interest 
other of the technologies of interest to are owned by third parties and are used by under license 
there are relatively few decided court cases interpreting the scope of patent claims in these technologies  and believes that its products and services do not infringe the technology covered by valid and enforceable patents 
this belief could be successfully challenged by third parties 
s patent applications may not protect its products  processes and technologies because of the following reasons there is no guarantee that any of s pending patent applications will result in additional issued patents  may develop additional proprietary technologies that are not patentable  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to or its collaborative customers will provide a basis for commercially viable products  
table of contents there is no guarantee that any patents issued to or its collaborative customers will provide with any competitive advantages  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to or its collaborative customers will not be challenged or circumvented or invalidated by third parties  and there is no guarantee that any patents issued to others will not have an adverse effect on s ability to do business 
could be subject to claims for infringing on patents of other intellectual property rights 
in addition  patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which operates is still evolving 
due to the fact that s business depends in large part on advancements made in genomic sequencing technology  there remains a constant risk of intellectual property litigation affecting the company 
the patent positions of organizations developing these products  services and technology  including  are generally uncertain and could involve complex legal and factual questions 
the degree of future protection for s proprietary rights is uncertain 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies  duplicate any of s technologies  or  if patents are issued to  design around the patented technologies developed by in addition  could incur substantial costs in litigation if they are required to defend themselves in patent lawsuits brought by third parties  or if initiates such lawsuits 
from time to time  third parties may assert that is infringing patents owned by such third parties 
will endeavor to settle such claims by mutual agreement on a satisfactory basis  which would result in withdrawal of the claim and or result in the granting of licenses to however  cannot make any assurances as to the outcome of any future claims 
we could be liable for any failure to comply with hazardous product regulations 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed our resources 
risks related to our financial results we have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses in the future 
we have incurred losses since inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over the next several years as we focus our resources on prioritizing  selecting and advancing our most promising drug candidates 
we may never be profitable or achieve significant revenues 
for example  we experienced net losses of million in  million in and million in  and as of december  had an accumulated deficit of million 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated greatly and may continue to do so 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis 
we expect that losses will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
our results of operations are difficult to 
table of contents predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period  which may cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to investors 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include changes in the demand for our services  the nature  pricing and timing of products and services provided to our collaborators  our ability to compete effectively in our therapeutic discovery and development efforts against competitors that have greater financial or other resources or drug candidates that are in further stages of development  acquisition  licensing and other costs related to the expansion of our operations  losses and expenses related to our investments  regulatory developments or changes in public perceptions relating to the use of genetic information and the diagnosis and treatment of disease based on genetic information  regulatory actions and changes related to the development of drugs  changes in intellectual property laws that affect our patent rights  payments of milestones  license fees or research payments under the terms of our external alliances and collaborations and our ability to monitor and enforce such payments  and the timing of intellectual property licenses that we may enter 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  fluctuations in quarterly results could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so 
for example  during fiscal year  the sale price of our stock ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall 
these factors include variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  clinical results  or new products by us or our competitors  introduction of new products or new pricing policies by us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or others in our industry  announcement by the government or other agencies regarding the economic health of the united states and the rest of the world  the hiring or departure of key personnel  changes in market valuations of companies within the biotechnology industry  and changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by financial analysts 
we have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests 
as of december   we had total consolidated debt of million  and for the year ended december   we had a deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges of million 
a variety of uncertainties and contingencies will affect our future performance  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow in the future to enable us to meet our anticipated fixed charges  including 
table of contents our debt service requirements with respect to our debt that we sold in and the following table shows  as of december   the remaining aggregate amount of our interest payments due in each of the years listed year aggregate interest thereafter total our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  or placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
our debt investments are impacted by the financial viability of the underlying companies 
we have a diversified portfolio of investments of which million at december  were invested in us treasuries and debt investments that are sponsored by the us government 
our corporate fixed rate debt investments comply with our policy of investing in only investment grade debt instruments 
the ability for the debt to be repaid upon maturity or to have a viable resale market is dependent  in part  on the financial success of the underlying company 
should the underlying company suffer significant financial difficulty  the debt instrument could either be downgraded or  in the worst case  our investment could be worthless 
this would result in our losing the cash value of the investment and incurring a charge to our statement of operations 
we may need to raise additional funding  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we believe that we have sufficient capital to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twenty four months 
however  our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that  at some future point  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and research and development efforts on a going forward basis 
to the extent that we need to obtain additional funding  the amount of additional capital we would need to raise would depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and progress of our research  product development and clinical programs  our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations  the progress of our collaborators  our costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products 

table of contents we expect that we would raise any additional capital we require through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional collaborations and licensing arrangements 
we cannot be certain that in the future these sources of liquidity will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in appropriate strategic situations  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contributions by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development and testing of products under development 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our shareholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates  or to grant licenses on unfavorable terms 
the relinquishing of rights or granting of licenses on unfavorable terms could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
however  should we be unable to obtain future financing either through the methods described above or through other means  we may be unable to meet the critical objective of our long term business plan  which is to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in biotechnology companies such as ours  or in the marketplace in general  is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions  we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire or any time thereafter 
risks related to our convertible debt and our common stock into which our debt is convertible we have significant leverage as a result of the sales of our debt in and in february  in connection with the sale of our convertible subordinated debentures due in  we incurred million of indebtedness 
in february  we repurchased million of these debentures  for total consideration of million  plus accrued interest of million to the date of repurchase 
as a result of the remaining indebtedness of million  our interest payment obligations amount to million per year 
in february  in connection with the sale of our convertible subordinated notes due in  we incurred an additional million of indebtedness 
in addition  in march  the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase an additional million of convertible subordinated notes due in as a result of this indebtedness of million  our interest payment obligations amount to million per year 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain further financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance  which may be subject to the financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these notes  due in and in  are effectively subordinated to all of our secured indebtedness and all indebtedness of our subsidiaries 
these notes are our general unsecured obligations and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries 
accordingly  these notes are effectively subordinated to all of our current and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing the indebtedness 
furthermore  our right to receive any distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon that subsidiary s liquidation  reorganization or otherwise  is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary  except to the extent we also are recognized as a creditor of that subsidiary 
as a result  these notes are effectively subordinated to the claims of such creditors 
there are no restrictive covenants in our indentures relating to our ability to incur future indebtedness 
the indentures governing our notes due in and in do not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payment of dividends  the incurrence of indebtedness  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of liens or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries 
we may therefore incur additional debt  including secured indebtedness senior to these notes 
as part of our growth strategy  we 
table of contents potentially may use proceeds from the offering to finance future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies  which may cause us or our subsidiaries to incur significant indebtedness to which these notes would be subordinate 
these notes  due in and in  are obligations exclusively of curagen corporation 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities 
our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on these notes or to provide us with funds for our payment obligations  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
in addition  any payment of dividends  distributions  loans or advances by our subsidiaries to us could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or that future working capital  borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt  we may have to delay or curtail our research and development programs 
the level of our indebtedness among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our notes  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
our ability to repurchase notes  if required  with cash upon a change in control or fundamental change may be limited 
in certain circumstances involving a change in control  we may be required to repurchase some or all of the notes due in certain circumstances involving a fundamental change  we may be required to repurchase some or all of the notes due we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or would be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the notes 
our ability to repurchase the notes in such event may be limited by law  by the indenture and by such indebtedness and agreements as may be entered into  replaced  supplemented or amended from time to time 
securities we issue to fund our operations could cause dilution to our shareholders ownership 
the conversion of our notes into shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our current shareholders 
we may decide to raise additional funds through a public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current shareholders  including the ownership that holders of the notes would have upon conversion  will be reduced  and the new equity securities may have rights prior to those of the common stock issuance upon conversion of the notes 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to existing shareholders and us 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  we maintain approximately of our cash and investments in financial instruments with original maturity dates of three months or less  in financial instruments with original maturity dates of greater than three months and less than one year  and the remaining in financial instruments with original maturity dates of equal to or greater than one year and less than five years 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
we estimate that a change of basis points in interest rates would result in a million decrease or increase in the fair value of our cash and investments 
our outstanding long term liabilities as of december  consisted of million of our convertible subordinated debentures due february   million of our convertible subordinated notes due february   and an accrued long term liability of million for the remaining future minimum payments under a license agreement see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as the debentures and notes bear interest at a fixed rate  our results of operations would not be affected by interest rate changes 
although future borrowings may bear interest at a floating rate  and would therefore be affected by interest rate changes  at this point we do not anticipate any significant future borrowings  and therefore do not believe that a change of basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item 
as of december   the market value of our million convertible subordinated debentures due  based on quoted market prices  was estimated at million  and the market value of our million convertible subordinated notes due  based on quoted market prices  was estimated at million
