critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue for finished products when the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer  provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exist  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is deemed probable 
deferred revenue we have sold extended warranty contracts covering a period of four to nine years beyond the one year basic guarantee 
the deferred revenue is recognized as income over the four to nine year period on a straight line basis commencing one year from the sale of the contracts 
intangible assets and goodwill we account for intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which was adopted by we on february  in accordance with that statement  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives  consisting of patents  trademarks  and rights  are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of to years  and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
for the years  goodwill was amortized using the straight line method  over a period of years 
goodwill and intangible assets with definite lives are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
any impairment loss would be expensed in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the impairment test for intangibles with indefinite useful lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets with its carrying amount 
when the carrying amount of the intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference 
intangible assets with estimable lives and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or assets group may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas recoverability of intangible assets with estimable lives and other long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an assets or asset group to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the assets or asset group 
if these comparisons indicated that an asset is not recoverable  the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or the asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we will be required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process will involve estimates of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for tax and accounting purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognised in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than august  early adoption is permitted 
the company expects to adopt sfas r on august   utilising the modified retrospective method 
the modified retrospective method requires compensation costs to be recognised beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all a share based payments granted after the effective date and b awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
amounts for prior years will be restated based on the amounts previously recognised under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognises no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  when adopted  the impact of sfas r on prior periods will approximate the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share in the summary of significant accounting policies note in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no  chapter  which requires companies to expense abnormal freight  handling costs  or spoilage in the period incurred and to allocate fixed overhead based on normal capacity  with adjustment if production is abnormally high 
this standard becomes effective for the company on august   with early adoption permitted 
the company currently accounts for abnormal freight  handling costs  and spoilage consistent with the standard 
the company plans to adopt the provisions early  on a prospective basis  as they relate to capitalization of fixed overhead expenses in the first quarter of the company is currently evaluating the effects of implementing this standard 
based on a preliminary analysis  the company does not expect that there will be a material effect on total company results 
there may be an impact on the results of certain quarters at the segment or total company level 
financial statements and internal controls we believe it is critical to provide investors and other users of our financial statements with information that is relevant  objective  understandable and timely  so that they can make informed decisions 
as a result  we have established and we maintain accounting systems and practices and internal control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are properly executed and recorded and that our policies and procedures are carried out appropriately 
financial controls and transparency our internal controls are designed to ensure that assets are safeguarded  transactions are executed according to management authorization and our financial systems and records can be relied upon for preparing our financial statements and related disclosures 
our system of internal controls includes continuous review of our financial policies and procedures to ensure accounting and regulatory issues have been appropriately addressed  recorded and disclosed 
the independent auditors perform audits of our financial statements  in which they examine evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in our financial statements  and also consider our system of internal controls and procedures in planning and performing their audits 
management controls our management team is committed to providing high quality  relevant and timely information about our businesses 
management performs reviews of each of our businesses throughout the year  addressing issues ranging from financial performance and strategy to personnel and compliance 
in addition  see item a controls and procedures below 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and risk management we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage certain of those exposures  we use futures  options and swaps 
the instruments we utilize in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools  involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
management believes that we satisfactorily diversify the counterparts used and monitor the concentration of risk to limit our counterpart exposure 
foreign currency translation we maintain our books and records in canadian dollars 
foreign currency transactions are translated using the temporal method 
under this method  all monetary items are translated into canadian funds at the rate of exchange prevailing at balance sheet date 
non monetary items are translated at historical rates 
income and expenses are translated at the rate in effect on the transaction dates 
transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of earnings for the year 
the translation of the financial statements from canadian dollars into united states dollars is performed for the convenience of the reader 
balance sheet accounts are translated using closing exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange rate prevailing during each reporting period 
no representation is made that the canadian dollar amounts could have been  or could be  converted into united states dollars at the rates on the respective dates and or at any other certain rates 
adjustments resulting from the translation are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder s equity 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt 
increase in prevailing interest rates could increase our interest payment obligations relating to variable rate debt 
for example  a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by
