overview applebee s international  inc and our subsidiaries develop  franchise and operate casual dining restaurants under the name applebee s neighborhood grill bar which is the largest casual dining concept in the world with nearly  system wide restaurants open as of december  the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry is highly competitive and there are many factors tha t affect our profitability 
our industry is susceptible to changes in economic conditions  trends in lifestyles  fluctuating costs  government regulation  availability of resources and consumer perceptions 
when evaluating and assessing our business  we believe there are five key factors o development the number of new company and franchise restaurants opened during the period 
as the largest casual dining concept in the world  applebee s has a unique opportunity to leverage our brand  system size and scale to optimize our future growth 
our expansion strategy has been to cluster restaurants in targeted markets  thereby increasing consumer awareness and convenience  and enabling us to take advantage of operational  distribution and advertising efficiencies 
we currently expec t that the applebee s system will encompass at least  restaurants in th e united states  as well as the potential for at least  restaurants internationally 
in  we opened restaurants including company and franchise restaurants 
we have opened at least restaurants each year for the past years 
in  we currently expect to open at least restaurants  comprised of company and franchise restaurants 
in addition  we may re open up to eight company restaurants in that were closed in by a former franchisee in memphis  tennessee  which are not included in our expectations above 
o comparable restaurant sales a year over year comparison of sales for restaurants open at least months 
our revenues are generated primarily from company restaurant sales  franchise royalties and fees and other franchise income 
increases in company and franchise comparable restaurant sales will result in increases in company restaurant sales and franchise fees and royalties 
company  franchise and system wide comparable sales increased  and  respectively  in we have had consecutive quarters of positive system wide comparable sales growth 
we currently expect system wide comparable restaurant sales to increase by at least percent in  with results expected to be lower during the first part of the year and accelerate throughout the year 
comparable restaurant sales increases are driven by increases in the average guest check and or increases in guest traffic 
average guest check increases result from menu price increases and or a change in menu mix 
although we may have increases in our average guest check from period to period  our main focus has been increasing guest traffic as we view this component to be more indicative of the health of the applebee s brand 
we are constantl y seeking to increase guest traffic by improving our menu with semi annual new menu rollouts and implementation of new programs such as carside to go tm and weight watchers tm 
carside to go tm is expected to be a driver of company  franchise and system wide comparable sales growth in o company restaurant margin company restaurant sales less food and beverage  labor  direct and occupancy restaurant costs and pre opening expenses expressed as a percentage of company restaurant sales 
company restaurant margin was in and we currently expect that our margi n will be similar in company restaurant margin is susceptible to fluctuations in commodity costs  labor costs and other operating costs suc h as utilities costs 
we attempt to negotiate contracts for the majority of our food products in order to mitigate the impact of rising commodity costs 
we currently expect commodity costs for beef  poultry and other proteins to increase by approximately in labor costs are impacted by many factors  including minimum wage rate and other employment laws 
o general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of total operating revenues 
general and administrative expense leverage is a key focus for us 
we currently expect that revenues will grow faster than general and administrative expenses 
i n  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues are currently expected to be in the high range 
o return on equity net earnings expressed as a percent of average stockholders equity 
we believe this is an important indicator as it allows us to evaluate our ability to create value for our shareholders 
we have exceeded our stated goal of at least return on equity for the pas t six years and are a leader in the casual dining industry in this category 
the above overview contains forward looking statements

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies involve a significant degree of judgment or complexity 
inventory valuation we state inventories at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
market is determined based upon our estimates of the net realizable value 
we purchase and maintain inventories of certain specialty products to assure sufficient supplies to the system 
we review and make quality control inspections of our inventories to determine obsolescence on an ongoing basis 
these reviews require management to make certain estimates and judgments regarding projected usage which may change in the future and may require us to record an inventory impairment 
property and equipment we report property and equipment at historical cost les s accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is provided on a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term  as defined in operating leases in note to the consolidated financial statements  or the estimated useful life o f the related asset 
the useful lives of the assets are based upon management s expectations 
we periodically review the assets for changes in circumstances which may impact their useful lives 
if there are changes in circumstances that shorten an asset s useful life  we will recognize increased depreciation expens e for that asset in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically review restaurant property and equipment for impairment on a restaurant by restaurant basis using historical cash flows as well as current estimates of future cash flows and or appraisals 
we review other long lived assets annually and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability is assessed in most instances by comparing the carrying value to its undiscounted cash flows 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful live s which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
income taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate will be recovered from future taxable income 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to recognize the extent to which  more likely than not  the future tax benefits will not be realized 
we are periodically audited by foreign  state and local tax authorities for bot h income and sales and use taxes 
we record accruals when we determine it is probable that we have an exposure in a matter relating to an audit 
the accrual s may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
legal and insurance reserves we are periodically involved in various legal actions 
we are required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of loss 
we determine the required accruals after a review of the facts of each legal action 
we use estimates in the determination of the appropriate liabilities for genera l liability  workers compensation and health insurance 
the estimated liability is established based upon historical claims data and third party actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
unanticipated changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates 
we periodically reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments whe n significant facts and circumstances dictate 
a change in any of the above estimates could impact our consolidated statements of earnings and the related asset or liability recorded in our consolidated balance sheets would be adjuste d accordingly 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
captive insurance subsidiary in  we formed neighborhood insurance  inc  a vermont corporation and a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary to provide applebee s international  inc and qualified franchisees with workers compensation and general liability insurance 
applebee s international  inc and covered franchisees make premium payments to the captive insurance company which pays administrative fees and insurance claims  subject to individual and aggregate maximum claim limits unde r the captive insurance company s reinsurance policies 
franchisee premium amount s billed by the captive insurance company are established based upon third party actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims and administrative fees 
the franchisee premiums are included in other franchise income ratably over the policy year 
the related offsetting expenses are included in cost of other franchise income 
accordingly  we do not expect franchisee participation in the captive insurance program to have a material impact on our net earnings 
in  we will have fewer franchisee participants in our captive insurance program as we have reduced the number of insurance products offered by the captive insurance company 
our consolidated balance sheets include the following balances related to the captive insurance subsidiary o franchise premium receivables of approximately  and  as of december  and december   respectively  included in receivables related to captive insurance subsidiary 
o cash equivalent and other long term investments restricted for the payment of claims of approximately  and  as of december  and december   respectively  included in restricted assets related to captive insurance subsidiary 
o loss reserve and unearned premiums related to captive insurance subsidiary of approximately  and  as of decembe r  and december   respectively 
o other miscellaneous items  net  of approximately  and  as of december  and december   respectively  included in several line items in the consolidated balance sheets 
acquisitions on april   we completed our acquisition of the operations and assets of applebee s restaurants located in southern california for approximately  in cash 
our financial statements reflect the results of operations for these restaurants subsequent to the date of acquisition

liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations

in the past  we have obtained capital throug h public stock offerings  debt financing  and our ongoing operations 
cash flows from our ongoing operations include cash generated from company and franchise operations  credit from trade suppliers  real estate lease financing  and landlord contributions to leasehold improvements 
we have also used our common stock as consideration in the acquisition of restaurants 
in addition  we have assumed debt or issued new debt in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the last three fiscal years in thousands a s restated as restated net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used by investing activities  net cash used by financing activities  net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  capital expenditures were  in excluding the acquisition of franchise restaurants   in excluding the acquisition of franchise restaurants  and  in excluding the acquisition of ten franchise restaurants and lease acquisition costs 
in  we currently expect to open at least company restaurants  and capital expenditures excluding franchise acquisitions are expected to be between  and  including the potential costs to acquire and re open up to eight company restaurants that were closed in by a former franchisee in memphis  tennessee 
these expenditures will primarily be for the development of new restaurants  refurbishment and capital replacement for existing restaurants and the enhancement of information systems 
because we expect to continue to purchase a portion of our sites  the amount of actual capital expenditures will be dependent upon  among other things  the proportion of leased versus owned properties 
in addition  if we open more restaurants than we currently anticipate or acquire additional restaurants  our capital requirements will increase accordingly

in december  we completed the refinancing of our  unsecured revolving credit facility 
the new bank credit agreement provides for a  five year unsecured revolving credit facility  of which  may be used for the issuance of letters of credit 
the facility is subject to various covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require the maintenance of stipulated fixed charge  leverage and indebtedness to capitalization ratios  as defined 
there is no limit on cash dividends provided that the declaration and payment of such dividend does not cause a default of any other covenant contained in the agreement 
the facility is subject to standard other terms  conditions  covenants  and fees

fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities an d interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation  which replaces fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
this interpretation is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  for those companies that have yet to adopt the provisions of fin we adopted fin r in january and the initial adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

revised  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
revised requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value on the grant date of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that a n employee provides service for that award 
this new standard will be effective for us beginning in our third quarter of we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on issue accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eitf 
eitf require s that a business combination between two parties that have a pre existing relationship be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a pre existing relationship exists 
eitf also requires that certain reacquired rights including the rights to the acquirer s trade name under a franchise agreement be recognized as intangible assets apart from goodwill 
however  if a contract giving rise to the reacquired rights includes terms that are favorable or unfavorable when compared to pricing for current market transactions for the same or similar items  eitf requires that a settlement gain or loss should be measured as the lesser of the amount by which the contract is favorable or unfavorable to market terms from the perspective of the acquirer or the stated settlement provisions of the contract available to the counterparty to which th e contract is unfavorable 
we adopted the provisions of eitf in the fourth quarter of and the initial adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements the statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section regarding restaurant development  comparable sales  restaurant margin  general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures  return on equity and financial commitments are forward looking and based on current expectations 
there are several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described 
these risks include but are not limited to our ability and the ability of our franchisees to open and operate additional restaurants profitably  the ability of our franchisees to obtain financing  the continued growth of our franchisees  our ability to attract and retain qualified franchisees  the impact of intense competition in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry  and our ability to control restaurant operating costs which are impacted by market changes  minimum wage and other employment laws  food costs and inflation 
for a more detailed discussion of the principal factors that could cause actual results to be materially different  you should read our current report on form k which we filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes i n commodity prices 
our revolving credit facility bears interest either at the bank s prime rate or libor plus  at our option 
as of december   the total amount of debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was  a change in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of  per year 
we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings 
many of the products we purchase are subject to price volatility due to factors that are outside of our control which may impact supply and demand such as weather and seasonality 
as part of our strategy to moderate thi s volatility  we have entered into fixed price purchase commitments
