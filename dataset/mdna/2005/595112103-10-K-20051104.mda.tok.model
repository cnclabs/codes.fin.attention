manufacturing the company s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states  italy  japan  puerto rico  scotland and singapore 
the company s manufacturing facilities generally operate hours per day  days per week 
semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive  requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment 
most semiconductor equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment 
the company s process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex  involving a number of precise steps  including wafer fabrication  assembly  burn in and final test 
efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities 
the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size  number of mask layers  number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer 
other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size  cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment  equipment utilization  process complexity  cost of raw materials  labor productivity  package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment 
the company is continuously enhancing production processes  reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products 
in  the company manufactured most of its products using its nanometer nm line width process technology and began transferring its manufacturing operations to nm line width process technology 
the company expects to continue to transfer more of its manufacturing operation to nm and lower line width process technology in in most of the company s dram products incorporated its f hypershrink array architecture technology  a design rule that incorporates a memory cell in design features rather and the industry standard design features  which enables production of approximately more die per wafer 
wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled  clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality limiting contaminants 
despite stringent manufacturing controls  dust particles  equipment errors  minute impurities in materials  defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or defects which can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional 
success of the company s manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and thereby maximizing yield of high quality circuits 
in this regard  the company employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing  screening and testing processes 
the company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 
after fabrication  silicon wafers are separated into individual die 
functional die are sorted  connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages 
the company assembles products in a variety of packages  including tsop thin small outline package  tqfp thin quad flat package and fbga fine pitch ball grid array 
each completed package is then inspected and tested 
the company also sells semiconductor products in an unpackaged or die form 
the company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process  performs high temperature burn in on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow 
in addition  the company uses its proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burn in process  capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 
a significant portion of the company s memory products are assembled into memory modules for sale to customers 
memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards pcbs that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices 
memory components are attached to pcbs in a soldering process performed by screen printing machines and high speed automated pick and place machines 
completed modules are tested by custom equipment and visually inspected 
in  the company significantly increased its mm wafer production 
the company manufactured meg and meg ddr devices on the company s nm process technology on mm wafers  and manufactured the industry s first memory devices in production to utilize copper interconnects 
in  the company plans to continue increasing its mm wafer manufacturing capacity 
in recent years the company has produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products  which enhances the company s ability to allocate resources to its most profitable products but increases the complexity of the manufacturing process 
although new product lines such as nand flash  cmos image sensors and specialty memory can be manufactured using processes that are very similar to the processes for the company s predominant dram products  frequent conversions to new products and the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex  smaller volume parts can affect the company s cost efficiency 
however  the company s ability to competitively manufacture many of these products on existing mm lines significantly extends the useful life of this equipment

the company performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by tech 
the company also provides certain technology  engineering and training to support tech 
all of these transactions with tech are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from tech 
availability of raw materials the company s production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards  including several that are customized for  or unique to  the company 
the company generally has multiple sources of supply  however  only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the company s standards 
various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers  photomasks  chemicals  gases  lead frames  molding compound and other materials 
in addition  any transportation problems could delay the company s receipt of raw materials 
although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the company s operations in the past  shortages may occur from time to time in the future 
also  lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past 
if the company s supply of raw materials is interrupted  or lead times are extended  results of operations could be adversely affected 
marketing and customers the company s products are sold into computing and consumer  networking and telecommunications  and imaging markets 
approximately of the company s net sales for were to the computing market  including desktop pcs  notebooks  servers and workstations 
sales to both dell computer corporation and hewlett packard company exceeded of the company s net sales in  and  and aggregated  and of the company s net sales in  and  respectively

the company maintains sales offices in all of its primary markets around the world 
independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the company and are compensated on a commission basis 
the company makes shipments against these orders directly to the customer 
distributors carry the company s products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products  including competitors products 
segmentation of the memory market continues  with diverse memory needs being driven by the different requirements of personal computers  servers  mobile devices  and communications  consumer and other applications that demand specific memory solutions 
many of the company s customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products  which may take several months 
as the company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of existing memory products  more products become subject to qualification which may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the company 
backlog volatile industry conditions make customers reluctant to enter into long term  fixed price contracts 
accordingly  new order volumes for the company s semiconductor products fluctuate significantly 
orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment 
customers can change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty 
for these reasons  the company does not believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 
product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex  it is possible that the company may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications  contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses 
in accordance with industry practice  the company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with company specifications existing at the time of delivery 
under the company s general terms and conditions of sale  liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of  or a credit with respect to  amounts paid for such items 
under certain circumstances the company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose more extensive liability than that provided under the company s general terms and conditions 
competition the company faces intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies  including elpida memory  inc  hynix semiconductor inc  infineon technologies ag and samsung electronics co  ltd  sandisk corporation and toshiba corporation 
additionally  the company faces competition from emerging companies in taiwan and china who have announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations 
the company faces competition in the image sensor market from a number of suppliers of cmos image sensors as well a large number of suppliers of ccd image sensors 
some of the company s competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the company competes  invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities 
the company s competitors seek to increase silicon capacity  improve yields  reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs 
these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices 
research and development to compete in the semiconductor memory industry  the company must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes 
the company believes that expansion of its semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions 
the company has several product design centers around the world  the largest located at its corporate headquarters in boise  idaho 
in addition  the company has a facility at its boise site to develop leading edge photolithography mask technology 
r d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed  the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development  and personnel costs 
because of the lead times necessary to manufacture the company s products  the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing 
the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers 
r d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 
product development costs are recorded as r d expense 
the company s r d expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively
