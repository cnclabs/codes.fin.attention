item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes  which are expressed in us dollars and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada  which generally conform with those principles established in the united states except as explained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
this md a contains certain forward looking statements based on our current expectations 
these forward looking statements entail various risks and uncertainties  as discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward looking statements 
reference is also made to the cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements above 
nature of our business we are a leading producer of nickel  a hard  malleable metal which  given its properties and wide range of applications  can be found in thousands of products 
the largest end use for nickel is in the production of austenitic or nickel bearing stainless steels 
this end use currently accounts for about two thirds of demand for primary nickel 
we define primary nickel to be nickel produced from nickel containing ores 
the other principal source of nickel  as discussed below  for nickel bearing stainless steels and certain other industrial applications is secondary nickel or nickel containing recycled or scrap material 
we are also an important producer of copper  precious metals and cobalt and a major producer of value added specialty nickel products 
our principal mines and processing operations are located in the sudbury area of ontario  the thompson area of manitoba and  through a subsidiary in which we have an equity interest of per cent  pt international nickel indonesia tbk pt inco  on the island of sulawesi  indonesia 
we also operate wholly owned metals refineries at port colborne  ontario and in the united kingdom at clydach  wales and acton  england 
we also have interests in nickel refining capacity in japan  through inco tnc limited  in which we have an equity interest of per cent  in taiwan  through taiwan nickel refining corporation  in which we have an equity interest of per cent  and in south korea  through korea nickel corporation  in which we have an equity interest of per cent 
additionally  we have a per cent equity interest in jinco nonferrous metals co  ltd  a company that produces nickel salts in kunshan city  people s republic of china china 
we have also expanded our joint venture operations in china  through the formation of a new company  inco advanced technology materials dalian co  ltd  in which we have an equity interest of per cent 
this venture produces nickel foam products for the asian battery market 
in early march  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets representing the nickel foam business of shenyang golden champower new materials corp  a leading chinese producer of nickel foam 
pursuant to the terms of this acquisition  we will have a per cent interest in the company formed to hold these assets 
in addition  in we established a shearing and packaging operation in china for certain nickel products to service the specific needs of this market 
our business operations consist of two segments  our i finished products segment  representing our mining and processing operations in ontario and manitoba  our refining operations in the united kingdom and interests in the refining operations in japan and other asian countries referred to above  and ii intermediates segment  which represents pt inco s mining and processing operations in indonesia  where nickel in matte  an intermediate product  is produced and sold primarily into the japanese market 
in addition  as part of our strategy to be the world s lowest cost and most profitable nickel producer  we are currently developing two major new or so called greenfield projects  our wholly owned voisey s bay nickel copper cobalt project in the province of newfoundland and labrador  canada and our goro nickel cobalt project in the french overseas territorial community collectivit territoriale of new caledonia new caledonia in which we currently hold approximately a per cent interest following the capitalization of certain shareholder advances in late february in recent years  sales of our primary metal products were concentrated in the united states  europe  japan  elsewhere in asia  and canada  with about per cent of our revenues from nickel derived from sales of our nickel products in asia 
key factors affecting our business the price of nickel has represented  and is currently expected to continue to represent  the principal determinant of our profitability and cash flow from operations 
accordingly  our financial performance has been  and is expected to continue to be  closely linked to the price of nickel and  to a lesser extent  the price of copper and other primary metals produced by us 
historically  the demand for nickel has been closely correlated to industrial production in the major industrialized regions  in particular north america and europe and more recently asia  and we expect this positive correlation to continue 
during we experienced  and 
table of contents currently expect to continue to experience at least in  very favourable conditions and realized prices for the nickel products we produce based upon the relationship that has recently existed  and is currently expected to continue to exist at least for  between global nickel supply and demand  given that global nickel supply has not kept  and is currently not expected to keep  pace with underlying global nickel demand 
while we currently believe that this favourable relationship between global nickel supply and demand will continue beyond  we are not in a position to predict that those conditions will continue given the wide range of factors that could affect such conditions 
in  our average realized price for the nickel products we sold was  per tonne per pound  compared with  per tonne per pound for the london metal exchange lme cash price for nickel  the price that is generally viewed as the benchmark price for nickel  averaged  per tonne per pound in  compared with  per tonne per pound in given the relatively high nickel prices which prevailed during  the nickel industry did experience in some substitution of other products for primary nickel as well as the substitution of stainless steels having lower grades of nickel content or no nickel for stainless steels having higher grades of nickel 
since we sell our nickel products in all major geographical markets  the realized prices for our primary nickel and other metal products are influenced by both global and regional supply demand factors and by the availability and prices of secondary or metal containing scrap material  including nickel containing scrap generated by the stainless steel industry and other substitute or competing commodity products for the primary nickel and other metal products we produce 
we believe that the industrial based recoveries of the united states and japanese economies  coupled with continued economic growth in china and other asian countries  as well as the influence of hedge or similar funds which purchase and sell or otherwise trade in metals for profit metals trading funds  were important factors in the increase and volatility in nickel prices experienced in we currently expect these factors will continue to affect nickel demand and nickel prices at least for while global demand for nickel is the most important determinant of our profitability and cash flow from operations  our financial results are also affected by increases in the costs we incur to produce nickel and our other metals 
in and  we experienced increases in our costs due to a number of factors  including rising energy and pension and other post retirement benefits expenses  and the continued strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar and the effect this has had on our operating costs incurred in canadian dollars 
while we have continued to implement programs designed to manage our costs  our ability to successfully do so will influence our profitability and cash flow from operations 
we are moving forward with our voisey s bay and goro development projects as well as other capital investment initiatives 
in  we spent million  including capitalized interest  on our voisey s bay project  which currently includes an open pit mine  concentrator and related facilities and certain research and development and other programs  and we currently expect to spend approximately million on this project in we currently expect the first shipment of intermediate nickel concentrate from voisey s bay to our ontario and manitoba operations in late  with initial finished nickel production from voisey s bay nickel concentrate in early we currently plan to spend approximately million  including capitalized interest  on our goro project in in addition  pt inco announced plans in to construct a third dam at a cost of approximately million 
the new dam is the first stage of a four year million capital program aimed at raising pt inco s annual production by per cent to about million pounds of nickel in matte by our development projects are very important to our future given that the voisey s bay project represents a key source of intermediate product for our manitoba and ontario operations  in particular our manitoba operations given the decline in mine production which has been experienced over the past few years at this operation  and these projects will be needed if we are to remain a leading nickel producer in an expected growing nickel market 
our canadian operations  in particular our manitoba operations  will remain dependent at least through  in order to continue to produce nickel products at  or close to  their production capacities  on purchases of intermediate nickel products principally from two australian companies until we are able to supply sufficient volumes of intermediate nickel concentrate products produced by the voisey s bay project to these operations 
we currently plan to rely in part on  and accordingly  need to generate  very substantial cash flow from operations to meet our sustaining capital expenditure requirements and the planned capital expenditures for our development projects 
our planned capital expenditures are expected to total  million in

the nickel industry is highly competitive in all of its key aspects  including the exploration for  and the development of  new sources of supply  the acquisition of deposits  and the processing  distribution and marketing of nickel products 
the level of production and export of primary nickel from the russian federation russia as well as the supply of secondary or nickel containing scrap material  together with the continuing relatively limited level of domestic consumption of nickel in russia  has had  and could continue to have  a significant impact on the nickel industry s supply demand balance 
while we produce primary nickel  the other principal source or type of nickel used in stainless steel and certain other industrial applications  as noted above  is secondary nickel  which is also referred to as recycled or scrap nickel 
secondary nickel is recovered largely from austenitic stainless steel manufacturing and fabricating operations and nickel containing scrap from obsolete facilities and equipment 
in the recent past  secondary nickel has represented between and per cent of the total nickel used in the production of nickel bearing or austenitic stainless steels  with primary nickel accounting for between and per cent of such nickel use 
these percentages can vary based upon relative prices  the availability of scrap and other factors 
to the extent that the supply of such secondary nickel increases  such an occurrence could also adversely affect nickel prices and our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
highlights the year was one characterized by high nickel prices which we believe were due principally to broad based growth in underlying global demand for nickel and nickel containing materials  in particular in the united states  china and certain european countries 
the increase in demand is attributed to a recovery in non stainless steel applications for nickel  in particular for high nickel alloys and battery materials 
while primary nickel demand in stainless steel applications experienced virtually no growth in  global stainless steel production did increase  and primary nickel demand was negatively affected in this key application by the relatively large increase in nickel containing scrap consumption and substitution for nickel in certain stainless steel applications 
we believe that relatively low physical inventories  high prices and the active trading of metals trading funds contributed to the volatile price conditions experienced in  volatility that the nickel markets had not experienced in over years 
the difference between the high and low lme cash nickel prices for was  per tonne per pound 
the global nickel market was in deficit for as the level of demand exceeded the level of supply 
we believe that the level of demand was restrained by the amount of supply available  thereby limiting the demand growth rate and the size of the actual demand supply deficit 
the global nickel market reflected favourable fundamentals for primary nickel producers such as ourselves in as demand increased  although we estimate that underlying world demand would have grown by approximately seven per cent from levels if adequate nickel had been available to meet consumption 
underlying demand growth was driven by the strongest global industrial production growth in years  led by continued economic growth in china  as well as growth in south korea  taiwan and japan 
the industrial economies of the united states and europe also exhibited growth above the levels seen in the recent period 

table of contents the growth in primary nickel demand in was concentrated in the non stainless steel sector  as demand from the stainless steel sector  the largest end use of primary nickel  was adversely affected by several factors as discussed below 
nickel demand growth in the non stainless steel sector increased by seven per cent in  as demand for nickel for the production of high nickel alloys improved as a result of the recovery of the aerospace industry as well as growth in electronics and battery applications for nickel 
nickel demand from battery applications improved in  in part due to the increased production of hybrid electric vehicles that contain nickel in their battery systems 
however  high nickel prices and substitution effects adversely affected demand for nickel in plating applications 
world production of stainless steel increased by seven per cent to approximately million tonnes in this growth was due  in part  to increased capacity utilization at several large scale stainless steel manufacturing facilities which had been commissioned during and stainless steel production expanded in all major industrial regions and was particularly strong in south korea where new production facilities were operating at capacity during the year 
however  primary nickel demand growth in the stainless steel sector was adversely affected  as noted above  by a large increase in secondary nickel stainless steel scrap consumption  as well as an increase in the production of stainless steels containing relatively low amounts or grades of nickel one to four per cent and grades containing no nickel compared with higher nickel to per cent containing stainless steel grades 
the growth in the world supply of primary nickel in could not keep pace with the underlying demand growth and world supply for was lower than world nickel supply in  taking into account the  tonnes of nickel that had been pledged as loan collateral by one producer which was released into the market in  although production of primary nickel increased by four per cent in approximately per cent of global nickel production growth was the result of our recovery from our strike impacted levels experienced in in addition  domestic production of nickel in china and ukraine increased in from levels 
as a result  world primary nickel production increased by  tonnes to  tonnes in however  world primary nickel supply of  tonnes decreased from  tonnes in  taking into account the release into the market in of the  tonnes of nickel referred to above 
the growth in nickel demand during  coupled with the overall decline in supply for taking into account the  tonnes representing collateral for a loan which were released into the market in  as discussed below  created a deficit between supply and demand of approximately  tonnes 
inventories of nickel on the lme  a physical market i where various metals  including nickel  can be bought or sold for prompt or future delivery and ii representing the principal terminal market for primary nickel in the world  decreased during by  tonnes to a relatively low level of  tonnes at december  lme nickel inventories have declined by  tonnes in  with such inventories totalling  tonnes as of march  while represented a very strong year for the global nickel market given the demand supply fundamentals described above  there was also  as noted above  a very significant amount of volatility in nickel prices as reflected in the lme cash nickel price movements due  we believe  principally to differing views on continued economic growth in china and the trading in nickel by metals trading funds 
the lme cash nickel price opened the year at  per tonne per pound due  in part  to the expectation of tight market conditions 
on january  the lme cash nickel price reached its highest level since march    per tonne per pound 
despite a three week strike at the canadian operations of falconbridge limited and a  tonne reduction in lme stocks during the quarter  nickel prices experienced a volatile but overall decline during the first quarter of  with the lme cash price falling by  per tonne per pound on february  due  we believe  to the culmination of near term speculative trading in nickel by metals trading funds where these funds liquidated the positions they had accumulated in nickel 
the lme cash price was  per tonne per pound at the beginning of the second quarter  and lme stocks declined by  tonnes during that quarter 
continued concern over a possible economic slowdown in china led to ongoing price volatility and overall declining lme cash nickel prices to the middle of may 
the lme cash nickel price reached the year low on may  at  per tonne per pound 
from that point  continued lme stock withdrawals and positive demand growth contributed to the lme cash nickel price increasing and ending the second quarter of at  per tonne per pound 
in the third quarter  trading activity was limited during the traditionally quiet summer months and with a  tonne increase in lme stocks during this period  nickel prices declined to  per tonne per pound by september  prices increased in late september  despite a rise in lme inventories  and ended the quarter at  per tonne per pound 
nickel prices continued to increase during the early part of the fourth quarter of however  these gains were reversed as the nickel price fell by  per tonne cents per pound on october  representing the fourth largest one day decline based upon available information  as it appeared that a number of the metals trading funds liquidated their nickel positions on that same day 
we believe that the decision to liquidate these positions was not related to any change in the physical supply demand fundamentals for nickel 
lme stocks increased steadily throughout the balance of the fourth quarter and ended the year at  tonnes 
the lme cash price ended the year at  per tonne per pound compared with  per tonne per pound at the end of the lme cash nickel price averaged  per tonne per pound over the course of  the highest average annual nominal nickel price ever based upon available data 
the lme cash nickel price during the first weeks of continued to 
table of contents increase and was  per tonne per pound on march  this increase in price early in was  we believe  related to the reduction of lme stocks since the beginning of the year and renewed demand growth from china and other regions

highlights the world nickel market strengthened in as demand grew by approximately seven per cent during the year to  tonnes despite continued weakness in certain large segments of the global economy 
during  growth in industrial production continued in china and was positive in the united states and japan for the first time in three years  while economic recovery in europe continued to struggle to take hold 
the growth in nickel demand in was concentrated in the stainless steel sector  the largest end use of primary nickel 
nickel demand growth in this sector increased by almost eight per cent in  driven by a significant increase in stainless steel production and a decline in the stainless steel scrap ratio the proportion or ratio of nickel containing stainless steel scrap relative to primary nickel to the total nickel consumed by stainless steel producers 
the world production of stainless steel increased by nine per cent to approximately million tonnes in stainless steel production expanded in all major industrial regions and was particularly strong in china and south korea where new production facilities were commissioned during the year 
nickel demand growth in non stainless steel applications was relatively weak in  as one important end use market  high nickel alloys for the aerospace industry  continued to struggle with new aircraft orders remaining at relatively depressed levels 
however  demand for nickel in plating applications was relatively strong  led by growth in these applications in china  slightly offset by reduced demand for these applications in europe and the united states 
the growth in world production of primary nickel in could not keep pace with the demand growth experienced in production of primary nickel in was adversely affected by the labour disruption at our ontario operations during a three month period beginning june  which resulted in effectively no production from these operations which would normally produce about million pounds of primary nickel per month 
we believe that several other major producers failed to reach their projected production targets due to unexpected maintenance or operational problems 
the shortfall in production was partially offset by the release of approximately  tonnes into the market during  which nickel had been used as collateral for a loan to one nickel producer 
in addition  production of ferronickel in australia  new caledonia  colombia and the dominican republic increased in as a result  world primary nickel production increased by  tonnes to  tonnes in world primary nickel supply increased to  tonnes taking into account the release of the  tonne loan collateral mentioned above 
the significant growth in nickel demand during  coupled with the limited supply growth  created an underlying deficit between supply and demand in of approximately  tonnes 
with the release of the  tonne loan collateral referred to above  we believe there was a surplus in the global nickel market of approximately  tonnes in inventories of nickel on the lme increased slightly during by  tonnes  remaining at a relatively low level of  tonnes at december  the lme cash nickel price opened the year at  per tonne per pound and extended the gains made in by increasing relatively steadily throughout the year 
during the first quarter  nickel prices initially rose due to strong demand from the stainless steel industry and a reduction in lme inventories 
during the second quarter  speculation that a strike at our ontario operations could occur followed by the actual strike was a contributing factor in the movement of the nickel price to over  per 
table of contents tonne per pound 
the announcement of the release of the remaining tonnage of the loan collateral position was  we believe  sufficient to cause the lme price to fall below  per tonne per pound at the end of the second quarter 
the extended strike at our operations during the third quarter  accelerating demand and the fall in lme inventories prompted  we believe  the release of the balance of the  tonne loan collateral over a relatively short period of time in the third quarter 
the lme cash price ended at  per tonne per pound  an increase of per cent compared with  per tonne per pound at the end of results of operations compared with earnings summary the following bar chart describes the dollar impact in millions of dollars of the principal factors  both favourable and unfavourable unfavourable factors are shown in parentheses  affecting our net earnings compared with  with the starting point first bar on the left being the level of net earnings for principal factors affecting net earnings in comparision with in millions of dollars bar chart reflects reduction in unfavourable currency adjustments from million in to million in net earnings for were million  or per share per share on a diluted basis  compared with net earnings of million  or cents per share cents per share on a diluted basis  in results for included net income tax benefits totalling million and the following pre tax items  an asset impairment charge of million related to the write off of certain capitalized costs for our goro nickel cobalt project due to changes in project scope and other factors  and unfavourable non cash currency translation adjustments of million

table of contents nickel production nickel production increased by per cent to  tonnes million pounds in  our highest annual production ever  exceeding our previous record of million pounds in  compared with  tonnes million pounds in  primarily reflecting higher production at our canadian and uk operations compared with when the three month strike at our ontario operations that began on june  and a difficult ramp up of operations in september following the strike negatively affected production 
pt inco s production increased by about million pounds to a record million pounds of nickel in matte in compared with million pounds of nickel in matte in historically  we have believed that the minimum finished nickel inventories we generally need to run our business and meet customers requirements should be about  tonnes  depending upon the required product mix and other factors 
we expect to continue to evaluate the factors to be considered in determining what this minimum inventory level should be 
finished nickel inventories were  tonnes at december  compared with  tonnes at the end of due to the timing of certain shipments in late copper production copper production increased by per cent to  tonnes million pounds in compared with  tonnes million pounds in and  tonnes million pounds in copper production in was also negatively impacted by the three month strike at our ontario operations 
net sales the following table sets forth deliveries and net sales of our principal metal products for the years indicated deliveries deliveries deliveries tonnes except as net sales tonnes except as net sales tonnes except as net sales indicated millions indicated millions indicated millions primary nickel  including intermediates inco source purchased copper inco source purchased cobalt precious metals in thousands of troy ounces other net sales to customers excludes toll refined materials 

table of contents realized prices the following table sets forth our average annual realized prices for the years indicated for the metal products we produce and sell per tonne per pound primary nickel  including intermediates copper cobalt per troy ounce platinum palladium rhodium gold silver net sales increased substantially in due to higher selling prices for substantially all the metals we produce  particularly for nickel and copper  as well as higher deliveries of inco source nickel  copper  cobalt and platinum group metals pgms 
deliveries of inco source nickel in increased by per cent compared with due to increased production at our canadian and uk operations as well as at pt inco 
production for all metals for was adversely affected by a three month strike at our ontario operations that began on june  primary nickel sales increased by per cent in from the previous year due to a per cent increase in our average realized nickel price and an per cent increase in nickel deliveries given the effect in of the three month strike at our ontario operations noted above on deliveries 
our nickel deliveries in represented an estimated per cent share of the world nickel market  compared with per cent in and per cent in our price realizations have tended to lag lme cash price changes 
the premiums we realize over the prevailing lme cash price for our specialty or value added and other nickel products are affected by i fluctuations in the lme cash nickel price  ii the effect these fluctuations have on the price we receive for the nickel in matte product produced by pt inco  iii the lag effect that changes in the lme benchmark price have on the pricing of certain of our nickel products  iv how certain of our nickel products are priced and v the mix of our primary nickel products sold in the year 
the average realized price for our primary nickel products  including intermediates  was  per tonne per pound in  compared with the lme cash nickel price which averaged  per tonne per pound 
the average realized price for our primary nickel products  including intermediates  was  per tonne per pound in  compared with the lme cash nickel price which averaged  per tonne per pound 
for the january march  period  the lme cash nickel price averaged  per tonne per pound and was  per tonne per pound on march  the price realizations for our nickel and other metal products generally reflect lme or other metal market prices and  over the longer term  depend principally upon the balance between demand for our primary nickel products in the marketplace relative to supply available from us and our competitors  including for this purpose  supply of secondary or scrap materials containing metals in usable or recyclable form and supplies of other materials which do or may compete as substitutes for nickel and our other metal products 
as noted above  the availability of nickel containing stainless steel scrap  which competes directly with primary nickel as a source of nickel for use in the production of stainless steel  is particularly important to stainless steel primary nickel demand 
the stainless steel scrap ratio was per cent in  compared with per cent in and per cent in in  our copper sales increased by per cent from the previous year due to a per cent increase in deliveries compared to the strike affected levels for and a per cent increase in our average realized price 
sales of precious metals increased by per cent in due to increased deliveries and increased selling prices in for substantially all of the precious metals we produce

results for included a pre tax expense of million associated with the three month strike at our ontario operations 
in addition  during the third quarter of our ontario operations experienced a series of unanticipated problems associated with the ramp up of certain of its facilities after the strike which resulted in an expense of million 
depreciation and depletion depreciation and depletion expenses increased in primarily due to higher depletion expense at the canadian operations as a result of increased production in at december   the net carrying value of property  plant and equipment under construction or development not subject to depreciation or depletion was  million  million   million which is comprised of amounts for the voisey s bay project totalling  million  million   million  the goro project of million million  million and other assets under construction at our operations of million million  million 
it is currently expected that depreciation  depletion and amortization for the voisey s bay project will commence in and for the goro project when operations start

reference is made to note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding a change in the calculation of depreciation and depletion expense effective january  which was applied on a retroactive basis 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in compared with the increase was primarily due to higher expenses associated with our earnings based incentive compensation programs  partially offset by lower expenses associated with share appreciation rights which historically had been granted as part of certain share option awards 
selling  general and administrative expenses also included million in spent on our program to evaluate and report on our internal control over 
table of contents financial reporting under the us sarbanes oxley act and certain expenditures totalling million in and million in in support of the goro and voisey s bay projects 
currency translation adjustments currency translation adjustments represented primarily the effect of exchange rate movements on the translation of canadian dollar denominated liabilities  post retirement benefits  accounts payable and certain deferred income and mining taxes into us dollars 
unfavourable currency translation adjustments were primarily due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar as of december  relative to the us dollar 
the canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate was at year end and at year end  representing approximately a seven per cent appreciation in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar on a year to year basis 
interest expense interest expense for declined compared with  primarily as a result of an increase in capitalized interest associated with our projects under development and lower interest rates on our outstanding debt for compared with  taking into account refinancing activities in and our interest rate swaps we entered into with certain third party financial institutions 
interest expense excluded capitalized interest of million in compared with million in we expect that our total interest costs expensed and capitalized will increase to approximately million in  with approximately million of that amount expected to be expensed and million expected to be capitalized as part of our goro and voisey s bay projects 
at december   approximately per cent of our long term debt reflected interest rates that were subject to periodic adjustments based on market interest rates 
our long term debt and average effective interest rates at december  are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements

asset impairment charges changes in the planned goro project configuration  including moving to direct heating of the ore feed and other changes intended to reduce the project s capital cost and enhance the operating efficiency of the planned process plant and the process to be used to recover metals  resulted in certain capitalized costs incurred  principally for engineering and related work associated with the original project configuration and for equipment purchased for the indirect heating of ore feed  no longer having any use for the project or otherwise 
as a result of these changes  an impairment charge covering capitalized expenditures of million before minority interest and taxes was taken in the second quarter of other income  net other income decreased in  compared with in  other income included gains on foreign currency contracts in the amount of million covering anticipated expenditures relating to the goro project 
we also realized a gain of million on the sale of our interest in a guatemalan subsidiary 
in  other income included gains of million realized from the sale or transfer of shares and other interests contributed to or received in conjunction with strategic and other collaborations relating to our primary metals operations  the receipt of a milestone payment of million under the terms of sale reached in of a non core exploration property and net gains of million in connection with derivative positions in metals intended to meet future customer requirements 
in addition  currency hedging gains of million were realized in on the closing out of certain forward currency contracts as a consequence of the goro project suspension 
income and mining taxes our effective tax rate for of per cent was slightly lower than the statutory rate due to the benefit of losses not previously recognized  the favourable outcome of tax matters related to prior years and the benefit of lower tax rates on profits earned in low tax jurisdictions 
these factors were partially offset by the negligible tax relief recorded on the million non cash impairment charge  before minority interest and taxes  recorded in the second quarter of and taxes provided on unrealized foreign exchange gains with respect to the canadian parent s us dollar denominated debt 

table of contents minority interest our minority interest represents primarily the respective minority shareholders interests in the earnings of pt inco  inco tnc limited  jinco nonferrous metals co  ltd

in  we realized cost reductions and related savings of million 
we are currently targeting a further million in cost reductions in energy costs and relative advantages energy costs are a significant component of production costs in the nickel industry since nickel production is very energy intensive  especially with respect to the costs of processing lateritic ores such as those processed at our pt inco operations 
we enjoy relatively low energy costs because of substantial production from our canadian sulphide ores  which generally consume only about one fifth of the energy required to process lateritic ores 
in addition  low cost energy is available from our hydroelectric facilities in ontario and at pt inco s lateritic mining operations in indonesia  and from purchased hydroelectric power at our manitoba operations 
in  our hydroelectric facilities in ontario generated approximately per cent of our ontario operations electricity requirements  and pt inco s megawatt hydroelectric generating facility at larona together with its megawatt hydroelectric generating facility at balambano generated virtually all of pt inco s electricity requirements 
the balambano facility has been able to generate power consistently above its design capacity due to improved water management practices and higher reservoir levels and other related factors than were assumed in developing its original design capacity 
in  energy costs at our ontario and manitoba operations were approximately per cent of total cash production costs  compared with per cent for pt inco 
the availability of captive hydroelectric power decreased cash energy costs at pt inco by about per cent in and per cent in relative to the energy costs that would have been incurred by pt inco if its operations were dependent on fuel oil as the sole source to meet its energy requirements 
intermediates segment our intermediates segment comprises the mining and processing operations of pt inco in indonesia where nickel in matte  an intermediate product  is produced and sold primarily into the japanese market 
net sales by pt inco of nickel in matte were million in compared with million in this increase in relative to was due to higher realized prices and increased deliveries as a result of record high production 
pt inco s deliveries of nickel in matte totalled  tonnes in compared with  tonnes in the increase in compared with was due to higher production 
pt inco s net realized price for nickel in matte in averaged  per tonne per pound compared with  per tonne per pound in the selling price of pt inco s nickel in matte is determined by a formula which is based upon the lme cash price for nickel 
all of pt inco s production is sold in us dollars under long term contracts with us and with sumitomo metal mining co  ltd 
nickel in matte production at pt inco increased by three per cent to  tonnes in from  tonnes in nickel unit cash cost of sales increased by per cent in compared with due to increases in the price of heavy fuel oil as well as greater usage of mining related services due to the higher production levels 
in order to increase production in favourable nickel markets  we augmented pt inco s hydroelectric power generation by increasing the utilization of more expensive fuel oil based power sources 
pt inco s energy costs were up in due to increased consumption of heavy fuel oil as a result of the higher production rates and higher prices paid for such fuel oil to operate its dryers  kilns and other oil fired facilities 
fuel oil costs were up per cent in from fuel oil represented about per cent of pt inco s cash costs of production of nickel in matte in compared with per cent in development projects segment our development projects include the voisey s bay nickel copper cobalt project in the province of newfoundland and labrador and the goro nickel cobalt project in new caledonia 

table of contents voisey s bay project we continued to make progress on the voisey s bay project in towards the start up of commercial production 
the project completion date for the initial phase  including the open pit mine  concentrator and demonstration plant to test hydrometallurgical processes  was advanced by six months from the original schedule established  with the first shipment of concentrate currently planned for november and initial finished nickel production from the voisey s bay concentrate in early work also advanced in to prepare our ontario and manitoba operations to receive and process the nickel concentrate from voisey s bay 
during  testing of hydrometallurgical processes to treat the voisey s bay ores as part of the research and development program covering those processes continued and design work on the demonstration plant to be constructed to advance the testing of those processes was completed 
site construction for the demonstration plant in argentia  province of newfoundland and labrador is proceeding on plan and that facility is expected to be ready to receive the first nickel concentrate in late goro project in late september  we essentially completed the second phase  or phase  of the comprehensive review of the goro project that established an innovative  value improvement program for the project  reconfiguring the originally proposed plant layout and other aspects of the project  and reducing the amounts of earthmoving  concrete and structural steel requirements  resulting in a million reduction in the capital cost estimate from previous estimates 
additionally  as part of that phase  a technical and process review recommended that direct heating of the slurry in the autoclave area of the planned process plant be adopted in the process design and that certain other changes be made to increase the process plant s throughput capacity 
as a result of the revised project scope  however  we recorded a write down  as discussed above  of million in previously capitalized costs in the second quarter of in october  we announced the decision to proceed with the project 
it is currently expected that the project s execution plan will be based upon a phased approach  with the first phase focusing on engineering  contract development and permitting 
engineering work has progressed well and fieldwork is expected to commence in the second quarter of it is currently expected that the project will commence production in the latter part of compared with earnings summary net earnings for were million  or cents per share cents per share on a diluted basis  compared with a net loss of  million  or per share per share on a diluted basis  in results for included net income tax benefits totalling million and the following items  before taxes unfavourable non cash currency translation adjustments of million  income of million representing a milestone payment received as part of the terms of the sale of a non core exploration property in  a charge of million for estimated remediation costs for certain former industrial sites in the united states we retained relating to a business sold in  expense of million associated with the three month strike at our ontario operations  currency hedging gains net of suspension costs relating to the goro project of million  income of million associated with a tax refund and a loss of million realized on the redemption of certain convertible debt securities

table of contents nickel production nickel production decreased by per cent to  tonnes million pounds in  compared with  tonnes million pounds in  reflecting lower production at our ontario operations due to the three month strike and the ramp up problems noted above  partially offset by higher production at our manitoba operations  the processing of higher volumes of purchased nickel intermediates at both the ontario and manitoba operations and higher ore grades and higher production levels at pt inco 
our results were negatively impacted by a planned furnace rebuild at pt inco which resulted in lower production for this operation 
finished nickel inventories were  tonnes at december   compared with  tonnes at the end of copper production copper production decreased by per cent to  tonnes in compared with  tonnes in copper production in was below our planned target of  tonnes due to lower production at the ontario operations as a result of the strike and ramp up problems noted above 
net sales net sales to customers for increased by per cent from the previous year due to significantly higher average realized prices for nickel which were partially offset by lower deliveries of nickel  platinum  palladium  copper and cobalt  and lower realized prices for certain pgms 
the decrease in deliveries was primarily due to lower production at our ontario operations as a result of the three month strike which was partially offset by higher nickel deliveries from pt inco and our manitoba operations and an increase in the deliveries of purchased finished nickel 
primary nickel sales increased by per cent in from the previous year due to a per cent increase in our average realized nickel price partially offset by an eight per cent decrease in nickel deliveries primarily due to the three month strike at our ontario operations 
our nickel deliveries in represented an estimated per cent share of the world nickel market  compared with per cent in in  copper sales decreased by seven per cent from the previous year due to a per cent decline in deliveries due primarily to the three month strike at our ontario operations  partially offset by a per cent increase in our average realized price 
sales of precious metals decreased by per cent in due to lower deliveries from decreased production also due primarily to that three month strike 
cost of sales and other operating expenses cost of sales and other operating expenses increased by per cent in  reflecting the adverse impact of a strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar on our costs incurred in canadian dollars  higher energy costs  higher employment and pension costs  and increased costs for purchased intermediates processed 
in addition  deliveries of purchased finished nickel in increased by per cent primarily due to increases in the purchases of this material to meet customer requirements as a result of the strike at our ontario operations 
the cost of these purchases is based upon lme and other benchmark prices and is included in cost of sales 
operating results for included a pre tax expense of million associated with the three month strike at our ontario operations 
in addition  during the third quarter of our ontario operations experienced a series of unanticipated problems associated with the ramp up of certain of its facilities after the strike 
these problems included outages or curtailments of operations at the oxygen plants and acid plant at those operations 
these problems resulted in lower than planned production of in process and finished material  including pgms from our own ores in ontario  and an expense of million was incurred during the third quarter of due to this production shortfall 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses totalled million in compared with million in the increase was primarily due to higher common share appreciation rights expense in connection with certain share option grants as a result of the significant increase in the price of our common shares in common share appreciation rights expense was million in compared with million in selling  general and administrative expenses also included certain expenditures totalling approximately million in both and in support of our goro and voisey s bay projects 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher spending on the hydrometallurgical processing research and development program as part of the initial phase of our voisey s bay project 
currency translation adjustments currency translation adjustments represented primarily the effect of exchange rate movements on the translation of canadian dollar denominated liabilities  post retirement benefits  accounts payable and certain deferred income and mining taxes  into us dollars 
unfavourable currency translation adjustments of million in were due to the significant strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during these periods 
the canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate was at year end and at year end  representing approximately a per cent appreciation in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar on a year to year basis 
interest expense interest expense for was million compared with million in interest paid in was higher due to the increase in our outstanding debt levels during the year 
however  this increase was offset by an increase in capitalized interest associated with our projects under development and by lower interest rates on our outstanding debt for compared with  taking into account our interest rate swaps 
interest expense excluded capitalized interest of million in compared with million in goro project suspension costs in  we incurred expenses of million in connection with the ongoing care and custody costs associated with the construction site at our goro project while the comprehensive project review was being conducted 
these expenses were offset by a gain of million which we recorded on forward currency contracts which had been entered into to hedge certain of the project s capital costs expected to be incurred in euros and other currencies 
these contracts became ineffective since they no longer matched the original timing of expenditures due to delays in project expenditures during other income  net other income increased to million in  compared with million in  due to gains of million realized from the sale or transfer of shares and other interests contributed to or received in conjunction with strategic and other collaborations relating to our primary metals operations  the receipt of a milestone payment of million under the terms of sale reached in of a non core exploration property and net gains of million in connection with derivative positions in metals intended to meet future customer requirements 
in addition  currency hedging gains of million were realized on the closing out of certain forward currency contracts as a consequence of the goro project suspension 
these gains were partially offset by a loss of million on the may  redemption of our convertible debentures due and lower interest income as a result of interest received on a tax refund being lower during compared with the interest on tax refunds received during income and mining taxes income and mining taxes for included a benefit of million resulting from a reduction in the canadian federal tax rate  partially offset by a million charge for an increase in the future tax rates in the province of ontario 
we also benefitted from favourable tax rulings and other decisions on tax matters from canadian and other jurisdictions concerning the tax treatment of certain prior period transactions in the amount of million as well as the favourable impact of net non taxable gains and higher earnings at pt inco  which are taxed at a relatively lower rate than earnings in other jurisdictions 
partially offsetting these tax benefits was the accrual for additional tax expense of million due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar

we currently estimate that our existing operations require  on an annual basis  on average approximately million of capital expenditures to sustain their operations and to meet current environmental regulations and similar requirements at our currently planned production and or utilization levels for these operations 
amounts included in post retirement benefit obligations in the table above represent the contractual funding requirements for our pension plans in the required funding amounts for our pension plans are actuarially determined and are subject to future uncertainties  including the expected or assumed rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate on pension obligations we use will be higher or lower over time each of which may change over time 
we have only included these obligations in the table for one year since such obligations are calculated on an annual basis

we currently believe that the ultimate resolution of such proceedings  claims and litigation will not significantly impair our operations or have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation 
in connection with our acquisition of diamond fields resources inc  we assumed an obligation to pay to a company retained by diamond field resources inc to provide certain exploration and other services an annual royalty in the form of a net smelter return amounting to three per cent of the net proceeds received from the sale of ores  metals and other minerals produced from our voisey s bay project  after deducting certain costs associated with the production and sale of the ores  metals and minerals produced 
while no such royalty payments have been made to date since the voisey s bay project is not yet in production  it is expected that these royalties will be payable once production from vosiey s bay reaches certain threshold levels currently expected to be met in in addition  as discussed in notes and b of the consolidated financial statements  in connection with a french government sponsored financing program for which our goro project qualified the girardin financing  we provided certain guarantees on behalf of goro nickel sa covering payments due from goro nickel sa of up to a maximum amount of million maximum amount in connection with an indemnity relating to certain potential liabilities associated with the loss or forfeiture by qualified french tax investors who participated in this program of certain tax benefits associated with the girardin financing add back indemnity 
we also provided an additional guarantee covering the payments due from goro nickel sa of a amounts exceeding the maximum amount in connection with the add back indemnity and b certain other amounts payable by goro nickel sa under the girardin financing relating to certain possible operational or other developments applicable to the goro project 
we also provided a guarantee covering certain termination payments due from goro nickel sa to the supplier under an electricity supply agreement esa entered into in october for the goro project 
the amount of the termination payments guaranteed depends upon a number of factors  including whether any termination of the esa is as a result of a default by goro nickel sa and the date on which an early termination of the esa were to occur 
if goro nickel sa defaults under the esa  the termination payment could reach up to an amount of euros million 
this maximum amount could be payable if termination of the esa occurred prior to the anticipated start date for supply of electricity under the esa to the project 
once the supply of electricity to the project begins  the guaranteed amounts will decrease over the life of the esa

with respect to derivative instruments for currencies  we entered into canadian dollar forward contracts to hedge a portion of the canadian dollar denominated capital costs for the initial phase of voisey s bay 
no new positions were engaged for the euro and australian dollars in respect of the goro project because of the suspension of this project in late as discussed above 
in  our interest rate swap in respect of our debentures due was cancelled and this debt was redeemed 
we entered into new swap arrangements in to manage the entire amount of the interest rate risk associated with our debentures due and our notes due other off balance sheet arrangements during  we had discussions with representatives of the province of manitoba regarding what amount of financial assurance covering future closure or similar requirements might be required for our manitoba operations under then recently enacted provincial regulations 
based upon those discussions  financial assurance in the form of a letter of credit of approximately million covering certain long term costs of maintaining certain of the manitoba operations was provided by us 
the province of manitoba established certain guidelines relating to what  if any  further financial assurance might be required for these operations 
while we currently cannot predict what  if any  additional amount of financial assurance will be required by this province  we do not believe that it will have a material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
as discussed under risks and uncertainties environmental risks below  as of december  we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million to secure a portion of our closure costs covering three mines in our ontario operations 
we have also provided a letter of credit in the amount of approximately million covering certain remediation costs if we abandoned the construction of certain infrastructure at voisey s bay 
the off balance sheet arrangements we currently have in place involve accounts receivable securitized financing arrangements in the united states and japan with unrelated entities under which up to approximately million in eligible receivables may be sold by us to these entities at any time 
under these accounts receivable financing arrangements  a significant deterioration in our credit rating and or accounts receivable being sold could give the purchaser of such receivables the right not to renew the arrangements 
we have accounted for these securitizations as asset sales since their inception but have recorded where relevant any loss retention reserves with respect to the sale 
as at december   the aggregate amount of receivables sold was million 
we do not currently believe that our liquidity would be substantially reduced if these arrangements were not available to us 
there are no significant long term contractual arrangements with any related parties that create or result in any obligations that are not on an arm s length  negotiated basis 

table of contents risks and uncertainties the following risks and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our outlook and future prospects 
market risk we define market risk as being the risk of potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
given the nature of our business and operations  the areas of highest market risk or exposure for us are nickel prices and  to a lesser extent  our prices of other metals and commodities that we produce or purchase representing what we refer to as our metals and commodities risk  foreign currency exchange rates representing what we refer to as our foreign exchange risk and interest rates representing what we refer to as our interest rate risk  all of which are as discussed below 
in the case of our metals and commodities risk  we sell our products at prices based on world market prices and purchase fuel oil and other supplies at market prices since these supplies are essentially commodities which can be purchased from a large number of available sources 
in addition to the two australian suppliers of intermediate products to our canadian operations referred to below  we have a limited number of sole source suppliers of critical materials or services  including electricity in canada and other locations 
while the prices for our primary nickel and other metals produced are based largely on  and sold in  us dollars  we are subject to foreign exchange risk because we incur a substantial portion of our costs and expenses in currencies other than the us dollar  in particular the canadian dollar 
we are exposed to additional foreign exchange risk and are also exposed to interest rate risk because  to the extent that we fund our operations and capital expenditures primarily through long term and short term borrowings  these borrowings are primarily in us dollars 
based upon past movements of certain foreign currency exchange rates  as described below  and our current expectations of continued volatility in such exchange rates for  we believe that the potential near term impact on future earnings and cash flows with respect to a change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
based upon recent past movements in interest rates  as described below  and our current expectations of changes in interest rates in  we currently believe that the potential near term impact of such changes on future earnings will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the metals and commodity risks relating to nickel and  to a lesser extent  other metals produced by us  given the significance of price realizations to us of such metals  are expected to continue to have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
with the increase in nickel prices and price volatility experienced in  the nickel industry has seen some substitution of other less costly metals or materials for nickel in certain applications 
any significant increases in such substitution  particularly if such changes represented a permanent shift away from the use of nickel  would be expected to adversely affect nickel demand and our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow from operations 
an uncertain global economic environment would be expected to have a significant adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows given  as indicated above  the historical correlation between industrial production and demand for primary nickel and the other products we produce 
there can be no assurance that oversupply situations that existed in the past in the nickel markets could not reoccur in the future 
any excess supply condition would have an adverse effect on the prices realized by us for our nickel products 
other international economic trends  expectations of inflation and political events in major nickel producing and consuming countries could also adversely affect nickel prices and the prices of other metals produced by us 
these factors are beyond our control and have resulted  and are expected to continue to result  in a high degree of price volatility for nickel and other primary metals produced by us 
there can be no assurance that the price for nickel or other metals produced by us will not decline significantly from current levels 
a return to nickel price realizations for us reasonably near to the relatively low price of nickel reflected by the lme cash nickel price which prevailed throughout most of and into the first half of when the lme cash nickel price reached a low of  per tonne per pound in december  as a result of the decrease in nickel demand experienced in and the expected increase in nickel supply to be brought into the market from three new australian laterite nickel projects that had been developed  and during a portion of the second half of when the lme cash nickel price was as low as  per tonne per pound in october  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
if demand for nickel in asia  or any other major consuming region  were to decline significantly  such an event would be expected to negatively affect nickel prices and our results of operations  financial condition and our cash flow from operations 
if and to the extent that  given the positive correlation that has existed historically between demand for nickel and industrial production  other industrialized regions of the world were to experience slower economic growth or an actual decline in economic growth  such a development would also be expected to affect nickel prices and our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow from operations 
we have experienced periods of low nickel prices due to over supply conditions and or declines in nickel demand and  
table of contents given the historically cyclical nature of nickel supply and demand  we expect that similar periods could reoccur in the future which could result in our experiencing unfavourable results of operations  including net losses and negative cash flows 
we have engaged in transactions to reduce  to varying degrees  the impact of certain of these market risks to which we are exposed on our earnings and cash flow from operations 
we have established policies and procedures governing the use of derivative instruments to address certain market risks 
these policies and procedures are intended to reduce some of the uncertainties associated with the market risks specific to our business and operations and reduce the effect of market fluctuations relating to the metals we produce and supplies of products and services we need for our operations on our earnings and cash flows 
we only use derivative instruments based on an economic analysis of the underlying exposures  factoring in the anticipated correlations of the underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse effects on future earnings and cash flows due to fluctuations in metals and commodities prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates will be offset by proceeds from  and changes in the fair value of  the derivative instruments 
we do not  however  hedge our exposure to all market risks and do not hedge our exposure to any market risk in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flows 
we have had in place an internal risk management committee for a number of years 
this committee is comprised of senior financial and marketing executives and chaired by our chief executive officer 
this internal committee oversees our hedging activities  whereby we use derivative instruments to reduce market risks 
the risk management committee s oversight includes reviewing compliance with our risk management policies authorized by our board of directors 
the risk management policies set forth the responsibilities of the internal risk management committee  its membership and conduct  reporting requirements  controls  maximum hedging limits and related authorizations delegated by our board of directors 
under our risk management policies  hedging activities are restricted by maximum limits which are specifically approved by our board of directors 
the maximum limits are usually tied to a maximum percentage of forecast annual production volume or annual requirements  in the case of supplies or currencies  as the case may be for current and future years  up to five years 
maximum limits are  subject to changes in  or stand alone authorizations which inco s board of directors may approve from time to time  currently as follows for nickel year per cent of forecast annual production  year per cent  year per cent  copper  platinum  palladium and gold years and per cent of forecast annual production  years to per cent  certain supplies to our operations such as oil  natural gas and electricity year per cent of forecast annual requirements  year per cent  years to per cent  and foreign currency year per cent of forecast annual requirements  years and per cent  years and per cent 
to the extent that we do hedge for certain metals other than nickel and for supplies and foreign currencies  we have historically hedged at levels below these limitations absent specific circumstances where we believe that hedging up to or close to such limits would be appropriate 
in the case of metals  other than nickel  produced by us  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments to fix minimum realized prices and  in the case of nickel  as discussed below  we have entered into formal sales or purchase contracts to hedge certain sales to our customers or purchases by us from suppliers of intermediate products 
in addition  pursuant to our annual financing plan approved each year by our board of directors  as well as specific debt financings authorized by our board of directors from time to time  interest rate swaps may be authorized to effectively convert the interest rate applicable to all or part of a debt financing from a fixed to a floating rate or vice versa at rates covered by such approvals or authorizations  including interest rate swaps entered into on a short term basis in anticipation of the completion of a specific financing 
in addition to a quarterly review by our internal risk management committee of all hedging activities and hedge positions  for each quarter all hedging activities and hedge positions are reviewed with and reported to our audit committee 
our internal audit group is also responsible for examining internal controls  trade execution and monitoring  reporting and compliance with the risk management policy annually 
metals and commodities risk we are subject to metals and commodities risk because we sell our products and purchase fuel oil and other supplies or services at prices for the most part effectively determined through trading on major commodity exchanges  in particular the lme and the new york mercantile exchange 
the prices offered on these exchanges generally reflect the global balance of supply and demand for the particular metal or commodity but are also influenced in the short term by such factors as investment funds flow  speculative activity in the particular commodity and currency exchange rates 
the price of nickel  our principal product  continues to represent the major factor influencing our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow from operations 
the selling prices for our primary nickel products are generally based on the lme cash 
table of contents nickel price 
however  certain of our products are customarily sold at a premium over the lme cash price  particularly special products such as nickel powders and foams 
the markets for our products have been  and are expected to continue to be  cyclical in nature and prices have been  and are expected to continue to be  volatile 
however  because we are one of the largest producers and marketers of primary nickel in the world  we have chosen  subject to certain limited exceptions as discussed below  not to hedge or otherwise attempt to mitigate to any significant degree the risk of fluctuations in the price of nickel 
we review this policy from time to time and may choose to increase the currently limited use of derivative instruments to reduce such risks in the future 
in the case of other metals produced by us  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments to fix minimum realized prices 
we do enter into lme forward purchase contracts which are substantially offset by fixed price customer contracts in order to more fully expose us to nickel price risk 
we also enter into lme forward sales contracts to minimize nickel price risk associated with purchased nickel inventories of intermediates and finished nickel products 
in respect of these types of hedges  at december  we had outstanding lme forward contracts to purchase  tonnes of nickel during the to period at an average price of  per tonne per pound and lme forward contracts to sell  tonnes of nickel during at an average price of  per tonne per pound 
depending on market conditions  we enter into precious metals hedging contracts with various financial counterparties 
these contracts  in the form of swap contracts whereby we simultaneously sell at a fixed price and buy the same quantities for the same maturity dates at a floating price  are intended to provide certain minimum price realizations in respect of a portion of our future production of such metals 
at december   we had outstanding swap contracts to exchange payments on  troy ounces of palladium during under the swap contracts  we receive a fixed price of per troy ounce and pay a floating price based on monthly average spot prices 
at december   we had outstanding swap contracts to exchange payments on  troy ounces of platinum in the aggregate during and under these swap contracts  we receive fixed prices for platinum at an average price of per troy ounce and pay a floating price based on monthly average spot prices 
at december   we had outstanding swap contracts to exchange payments on  troy ounces of gold in the aggregate during under these swap contracts  we receive fixed prices at an average price of per troy ounce and pay a floating price based on monthly average spot prices 
at december   we had outstanding put option contracts  giving us the right but not the obligation to sell  troy ounces of platinum at an average price of per troy ounce at various dates over the to period  and sold call option contracts  giving the buyer the right but not the obligation  to purchase  troy ounces of platinum at an average price of per troy ounce during the same time period 
we use fuel oil swap contracts to reduce the effect of fuel oil price changes in respect of a portion of our energy requirements at pt inco 
under these contracts  we receive or make payments based on the difference between a fixed and a floating price for fuel oil 
at december   we had entered into swap contracts with financial institutions to exchange payments on  tonnes of fuel oil in aggregate during under the swap contracts  we pay fixed prices averaging per tonne for fuel oil and receive a floating price based on monthly average spot price quotations 
reference is made to derivative instrument positions under off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations above and note to our consolidated financial statements for information concerning our derivative instruments  including how the fair value of such instruments has been determined 
once our development projects begin commercial production  we will become a significant producer of cobalt 
when that occurs  we could be affected by the highly competitive market for cobalt that currently exists and is expected to continue to exist 
cobalt sold to customers is currently sold either on a fixed price basis using annual contracts for customers in certain industries or on the basis of prices as quoted in the metals bulletin and platts  which are recognized metals industry publications that publish cobalt and other metal prices 
such published prices are generally accepted as representing the benchmark or market price indicator for cobalt 
cobalt  like nickel and copper  has historically been subject to significant price volatility and we currently expect that such volatility will continue 
the financial analyses undertaken by us during in support of the substantial investment to be made with respect to our goro development project has been based upon a long term price of cobalt of per kilogram per pound 
if realized cobalt prices  as well as realized prices for the other metals to be produced by our voisey s bay and or goro projects  were to be below the long term prices assumed by us  the expected financial returns from  and expected cash and other costs for  these projects would be adversely affected 
at december   none of our currently planned nickel or copper production is covered by  or subject to  derivative contracts 
at december   we had entered into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our planned precious metals production over varying periods up to four years 
outstanding derivative contracts for platinum cover per cent  per cent  per 
table of contents cent and per cent of planned platinum production in   and  respectively  for palladium the derivative contracts cover five per cent of planned palladium production in and for gold the derivative contracts cover per cent of planned gold production in we currently expect to produce precious metals from our estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves at our ontario operations for a period in excess of twenty years  a period that extends well beyond the maturity of our current derivative contracts covering precious metals 
we have in early entered into certain derivative contracts relating to our planned copper production 
reference is made to derivative instruments under off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations above 
foreign exchange risk by virtue of our international operations  we incur costs and expenses in a number of foreign currencies other than the us dollar 
the exchange rates covering such currencies have varied substantially in the last three years 
a substantial portion of our revenue is received in us dollars since the price of nickel and other metals we produce are generally referenced in us dollars  while a significant portion of our costs and expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar and between the us dollar and certain other currencies give rise to foreign currency exposure  either favourable or unfavourable  which have materially affected and are expected to continue to affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our primary foreign exchange risk is to changes in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
we reduce  from time to time  the impact of this risk by entering into forward currency contracts and foreign currency options 
however  these activities do not eliminate the potentially significant adverse effect that exchange rate fluctuations could have on our results of operations or financial condition 
at the end of  these contracts took the form of forward contracts  which establish a fixed exchange rate for the future purchases of the canadian dollar and certain other currencies  principally the australian dollar and pound sterling 
the purpose of these forward currency contracts is to eliminate the risk of foreign exchange movements on i a portion of future canadian dollar capital expenditures relating to our capital projects in canada  primarily the voisey s bay project and ii a portion of the future australian dollar and pound sterling denominated construction costs for the planned production facilities for the goro project 
we are  to a substantially lesser extent  also subject to fluctuations in the value of the indonesian rupiah relative to the us dollar as a result of our operations in indonesia 
this impact is reduced by the fact that a significant portion of pt inco s costs and revenues are effectively denominated in us dollars 
because of the limited nature of this exposure  we do not customarily hedge the value of the rupiah against the us dollar and no such financial instruments were in effect at december  at december   we had outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase aus 
million at average exchange rates of  and  respectively  during  and we also had outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase pound sterling million at average exchange rates of and  respectively  during and the purpose of these contracts is to eliminate the risk of exchange rate movements on a portion of the future construction costs for the planned production facilities for the goro project 
total gains in the amount of million were recorded in as other income relating to contracts that were either ineffective or for which we did not apply hedge accounting 
we also recorded a gain of million in goro project suspension costs in respect of euro denominated foreign currency contracts which ceased to be effective as a result of the suspension of the goro project 
at december   we had outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase cdn 
million at an average exchange rate of during the purpose of these contracts is to eliminate the risk of exchange rate movements on a portion of the future construction costs of the planned facilities for the initial phase of the voisey s bay project 
we also had outstanding at december  forward currency contracts to purchase cdn 
million at an average exchange rate of during and the purpose of these contracts is to eliminate the risk of exchange rate movements on a portion of our future construction costs of a capital asset at our ontario operations 
in addition  at december  we had outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase cdn 
million at an average exchange rate of during the purpose of these contracts is to offset the foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of our canadian dollar denominated tax liabilities which are due in the first quarter of in respect of the calendar year 
we have experienced periods where the us dollar has been relatively strong in relation to the canadian dollar for example  in and  more recently  when the us dollar has been relatively weak in relation to the canadian dollar for example  in and 
historically  the positive correlation between the canadian dollar and metal prices has resulted in higher profit margins for us during periods when the canadian dollar has been relatively strong against the us dollar 
accordingly  while a stronger canadian 
table of contents dollar has historically led to higher cash operating costs for us in us dollar terms  the historical accompanying increase in metal prices has resulted in higher profit margins 
conversely  historically when the canadian dollar has weakened relative to the us dollar we have experienced lower cash operating costs in us dollar terms and the historical accompanying decrease in metal prices has resulted in lower profit margins for us 
due to this correlation and the historical responsiveness of nickel prices to cyclical supply demand factors  we do not currently anticipate that the impact of fluctuations in the canadian dollar over the relevant period for which we use the average exchange rates in estimating our ore mineral reserves will affect the quantities of our estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves given the relative importance of factors  including the mineralization  other than metals prices and exchange rates on the estimation of our ore mineral reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that the historical correlation between the change in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar and metal prices will continue and if it fails to do so our estimates of proven and probable ore mineral reserves could be adversely affected by a significant strengthening of the canadian dollar compared with the us dollar 
to the extent that we would use other expected metal prices and exchange rates for our estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves  these estimates could change significantly 
while the us dollar is the functional currency in our canadian operations  we are required  for income tax purposes  to report income subject to canadian tax in canadian dollars 
we have a number of long term debt obligations denominated in currencies other than canadian dollars 
fluctuations in the value of the relevant foreign currencies in relation to the canadian dollar can give rise to capital and or income gains or losses for canadian income tax purposes on the repayment of any such foreign currency denominated long term debt obligations 
since the us dollar is both our functional and reporting currency  no gains or losses on the settlement or marking to market of us dollar based obligations representing the primary dollar denomination of our long term debt obligations is reported in computing income reported in our consolidated financial statements 
for reporting purposes  we reflect the canadian taxes potentially payable on the settlement of our non canadian dollar denominated debt in computing our long term deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrealized gains and losses and as a current tax expense for realized gains and losses 
no taxable event in respect of the debt occurs until the debt is settled by payment or other form of discharge for canadian tax purposes 
should a fluctuation in the value between the canadian dollar and the relevant foreign currencies result in us being subject to reporting a capital and or income gain for canadian income tax purposes when a debt were repaid  we would report as either a current tax expense in respect of realized gains  or a deferred tax expense in respect of unrealized gains  for the canadian income taxes payable  in respect of such a gain 
this increase in our tax provision may distort our effective tax rate  since no such foreign currency gain would be reported in our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates results from investing and borrowing activities undertaken to manage our liquidity and capital requirements 
we generally have used fixed rate debt to finance long term investments  while variable rate debt has been used to meet working capital requirements and related requirements on a more near term basis 
at december   taking into account our interest rate swaps discussed below  approximately per cent of our total debt  or million  was subject to variable interest rates 
based upon the level of floating or variable rate debt at december   the impact of a per cent change in underlying interest rates  or basis points  would change interest expense by about million over a full year 
as noted under cash flows  liquidity and capital resources compared with above  we could be required to raise additional debt in the future to meet our capital expenditures and other requirements  and we could experience higher interest costs as a result of a downgrade in our credit ratings and  accordingly  in such cases our results of operations and cash flow from operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in interest rates in the future despite any interest rate swaps we might then have in effect 
as at december   we had an outstanding interest rate swap of a notional principal amount of million in respect of our debentures due  whereby we receive a fixed rate of interest of per cent and pay a floating rate equal to london interbank offered rates plus per cent 
we also had an interest rate swap of a notional principal amount of million in respect of our notes due  whereby we receive a fixed rate of interest of per cent and pay a floating rate equal to london interbank offered rates plus per cent 
in  we entered into a new interest rate swap in respect of our million term loan due whereby we receive a floating rate of interest at certain london interbank offered rates plus per cent and pay a fixed rate of per cent 
counterparty risk our interest rate swaps  metals and foreign currency risk management activities expose us to the risk of default by the counterparties to such arrangements 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support derivative instruments subject to credit risk but mitigate this risk by 
table of contents dealing only with counterparties that we believe  based upon an assessment of each such counterparty s financial history and experience  to be financially sound and  accordingly  we do not anticipate a loss for non performance by any counterparty with whom we have a commercial relationship 
environmental risk environmental legislation and regulations affect nearly all aspects of our operations worldwide 
such legislation and regulations apply to us along with other companies in the mining and metals industry 
these types of legislation and regulations require us to obtain operating licences  permits and other approvals and impose standards and controls on activities relating to mining  exploration  development  production  reclamation  closure and the refining  distribution and marketing of nickel and other metal products 
environmental assessments are required before initiating most new projects or undertaking significant changes to existing operations 
in addition to current requirements  we expect that additional environmental regulations will likely be implemented to protect the environment and quality of life  given issues of sustainable development and other similar requirements which governmental and supragovernmental organizations and other bodies have been pursuing 
some of the issues currently under review by environmental regulatory agencies include i further reductions in  or requiring enhanced stabilization of  various emissions  including sulphur dioxide  metals and greenhouse gas emissions  ii additional mine reclamation and restoration  and iii more restrictive water  air and soil quality and waste  tailings and other materials treatment and disposal 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard of the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica relating to asset retirement obligations 
this standard significantly changed the method of accounting for asset retirement obligations as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimate of the total liability for asset retirement obligations has been developed from independent environmental studies  which include an evaluation of  among other factors  information available at that time with respect to closure plans and closure alternatives  the anticipated method and extent of site restoration using current costs and existing technology  and compliance required by presently enacted laws  regulations and existing industry standards 
the total liability for asset retirement obligations represents estimated expenditures associated with closure  progressive rehabilitation and post closure care and maintenance 
potential recoveries of cash or other payments from the future sale of assets upon the ultimate closure of operations have not been reflected in the estimate of the total liability or related annual provisions or charges 
future changes  if any  to the estimated total liability  as a result of changes in requirements  laws  regulations and operating assumptions may be significant and would be recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimate  when applicable 
although the ultimate amount to be incurred is uncertain  the total present value of the liability for asset retirement obligations in respect of our worldwide operations to be incurred primarily after cessation of operations was estimated to be million including a current portion of such total obligation of million at december  based upon certain discount rates and timing with respect to when these costs would be expected to be incurred 
changes made in to mining regulations in the province of ontario require us to provide letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance intended to secure our ability to meet future reclamation and restoration costs  which are not expected to be incurred for many years  if we were to no longer meet certain minimum investment grade credit ratings for our outstanding publicly traded debt securities 
although our debt securities are currently rated investment grade  they were rated below investment grade in recent times and there can be no assurance that this situation will not reoccur 
if we are not able to maintain the minimum investment grade credit ratings  it is currently estimated that letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance associated with the currently estimated costs of the eventual future closure of our mines and other facilities in ontario would have to cover approximately million in such closure costs on an undiscounted basis 
due to the closure of three mines in ontario  in we were required under such mining regulations to provide letters of credit in the amount of million at that time to secure these near term closure costs as discussed below 
in addition  we are subject to certain indonesian regulations which require us to provide security for the reclamation of land areas that have been mined 
in the case of our manitoba operations  in we submitted closure and reclamation plans for all our operations in that province and in we provided  as discussed above  financial assurance in the form of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately million for certain future reclamation and restoration costs in that province 
it is possible that this province may require additional financial assurance with respect to our operations in manitoba 
however  it is not currently expected that these costs for our indonesian operations and or such additional financial assurance as might be required to be provided for our manitoba operations will be of a material amount 
these potential costs might not be incurred until many years in the future 
if these requirements for letters of credit or other forms of financial security had to be satisfied  they could have an adverse effect on the amounts available for borrowing by us under our bank credit facilities 
in february  the ontario government issued a control order february order that requires us to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by per cent from the current limit of  tonnes to  tonnes at our ontario smelting operations by the end of we are currently implementing an investment of approximately million in fluid bed roaster off gas scrubbing 
table of contents technology intended to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions to the new levels mandated by this new control order by the end of as part of the control order  we will also be required to i reduce ground level concentrations of sulphur dioxide  ii continue research into the technology and economics of further reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions and iii report annually to the ontario ministry of the environment and the public on the progress of this research program 
the february order calls for a final report on achieving the additional reductions to be submitted by december  we do not currently expect that compliance with the annual sulphur dioxide emission levels from our smelter operations or ground level concentrations levels as set forth in the february order will have any significant effect on our costs  operating procedures or annual production of nickel and other primary metals from our ontario operations 
in june  the ontario ministry of environment released a discussion paper on new regulatory proposals for an industrial emission reduction program ierp 
the ierp would require reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions by that would equate to a per cent reduction from the existing limit of  tonnes per year referred to above 
in mid february  a draft regulation covering such proposed reductions was issued 
we have responded to these proposed reduction proposals included in the ierp  indicating what our current ability to meet these requirements would be  particularly in view of the current limits of existing sulphur dioxide emission control technologies 
we currently believe that the proposed reductions set forth as part of the ierp and the draft regulation will be included in legislation to be drafted in for comment 
if such proposed reductions were to become law  we believe that those reductions would be consistent until with the requirements of the february order and we would  accordingly  be able to meet those proposed reductions through however  if the reductions proposed by the ierp and the draft regulation for and beyond were to come into effect  we cannot predict whether  based upon the limits of existing technologies and the costs required to implement changes in our processes or otherwise  we would be able to meet them on a cost effective basis 
in september  the canadian federal environmental agency  environment canada  published a notice indicating its intention  under the requirements of the canadian environmental protection act  to control emissions from base metal smelters and refineries using pollution prevention planning and a code of best practices for this sector 
the notice also indicated a set of emission targets that each smelter in canada  including our facilities in ontario and manitoba  would be expected to meet 
environment canada has provided for an eighteen month period  commencing in september  for companies to indicate whether they could develop a plan to meet their proposed new targets on certain emissions 
we are currently assessing the implications of the proposed targets on emission limits developed by environment canada on our operations and have been discussing with environment canada and other parties how to develop an approach to such proposed limits that will meet the objectives of all parties 
while we are not able to determine the effect  if any  that the ierp proposed reductions and these other recent developments and other significant future changes in regulatory emission limits and other environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future may have on our operations  due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and ultimate form that such changes may take  any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million to secure a portion of our closure costs related to the closure of three mines in ontario 
these letters of credit have a term of one year and will automatically renew without any action by either us or the counterparty until the earlier of i inco having complied with the terms of the certified closure plans or ii funds from such letters of credit being utilized by the ontario ministry of northern development and mines  the ministry responsible for overseeing such closure plans  to perform rehabilitation work if we did not meet the requirements with respect to such closure plans 
we are required to submit annual updates on changes to the closure plans  including any decommissioning and rehabilitation work completed during the previous year 
we have also provided letters of credit or similar forms of financial assurance to secure future closure costs associated with certain other operations or projects in north america and elsewhere which currently have  or are expected to have  fairly extended useful lives 
we have also provided a letter of credit in the amount of approximately million covering certain remediation costs if we abandoned the construction of certain infrastructure at voisey s bay 
canada signed and ratified the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change kyoto protocol in december the kyoto protocol calls for significant reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide  and nationwide ceilings on such emissions 
in november  the federal government of canada released an initiative to address certain causes of climate changes 
the specific requirement of this initiative is also to limit the discharge of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 
neither the kyoto protocol nor this other initiative has as yet established what the specific allocation of reductions among various sources of greenhouse gases would be 
in august  the federal government of canada released certain principles covering the kyoto protocol intended to be used to implement the objective of having the oil and gas  thermal energy and mining and manufacturing sectors reduce greenhouse gases by certain specified limits 
while during there was relatively little progress on advancing the implementation of greenhouse gas emission reductions as part of the kyoto protocol  the kyoto protocol was ratified or confirmed on an international basis in mid february while the precise impact of the kyoto protocol and its ratification or confirmation on our operations in canada and the operations of others who provide energy or other products or services to us is uncertain at this time  we anticipate that compliance with these initiatives could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and costs 

table of contents in  the danish environmental protection agency the danish epa  as part of the authority granted to it under certain environmental regulations of the european union commission intended to control the risk to humans and the environment from certain chemicals and other substances  published draft risk assessment reports  including certain conclusions concerning potential human health hazards associated with nickel metal and certain soluble nickel compounds  including nickel sulphate  nickel chloride and nickel nitrate 
under this european regulatory framework  there are generally four stages associated with the risk assessment process covering substances such as chemicals and other materials data collection  priority setting  risk assessment and risk reduction 
the danish epa determined that  based on certain animal studies  soluble nickel is a reproductive toxin and has proposed certain product labelling requirements as a result of this determination 
it has also assessed certain other environmental issues 
in addition  based upon the draft reports released in and taking into consideration certain studies  the danish epa has proposed that soluble nickel be classified under its hazard classification system as a known human carcinogen 
in  european union member states agreed that soluble nickel compounds should be classified as a category known human carcinogen carcinogen and a category based on animal studies reproductive toxin 
it was also proposed that metallic nickel will be classified as a category suspected carcinogen 
these revised classifications would mean changes in product labelling  communication to workers and customers and the development of risk management measures for these forms of nickel 
the danish epa has  however  concluded that there was insufficient information to complete its environmental risk assessment  and in collaborative studies were undertaken to collect data on the behaviour of nickel in the environment and european background levels and emission sources 
it is currently expected that there will be sufficient information to complete the environmental risk assessment in late or early while the health risk assessment is currently expected to be finalized in the next stage in this regulatory process will be the implementation of risk management and risk reduction practices for those nickel substances considered in the risk assessment 
in the development of such requirements  the authorities are obligated to take into account technical feasibility and socio economic considerations 
some of the risk reduction practices that may be considered include modifications to material safety data sheets  the introduction of labelling describing the hazards and more restrictive packaging of soluble nickel compounds  lowering of the european occupational exposure limit for nickel and stricter engineering controls  including total containment of nickel processes 
if the requirements currently being considered as part of such risk assessments were to come into effect  it could result in use restrictions and other requirements which could have a material adverse effect on certain nickel producers and end users of the forms of nickel covered by such classifications  and on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the revised classification would also mean changes in labelling  communication to workers and customers and the development of risk management measures 
member states of the european union will have until to achieve certain target limit values for nickel  after which more stringent binding limit values may be considered 
the technical and socio economic feasibility of meeting such limits are currently being considered by the european union commission and those industries that would be affected  including nickel producers 
further changes in environmental laws  restrictions on our discharge of greenhouse gases as a result of canada s program to comply with the kyoto protocol and similar developments that may be imposed  as well as the collection of new information on existing environmental conditions and other events  including legal proceedings brought based upon such conditions or an inability to obtain necessary permits  could require us to make significant other expenditures or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the changes outlined above and other changes in environmental legislation could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products  product quality and methods of production and distribution 
the complexity and breadth of these issues make it extremely difficult to predict their future impact on us 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures and operating expenses will increase in the future as a result of the implementation of existing and new and increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
compliance with environmental legislation can require significant expenditures and failure to comply with environmental legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties  liability for clean up costs  damages and the loss of important permits 
there can be no assurance that we will at all times be in compliance with all environmental regulations or that steps to bring us into compliance would not materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we may also be subject to claims from persons alleging that they have suffered significant damages as a result of the environmental impact of our operations  including facilities that have ceased to operate for many years 
other risks and uncertainties pt inco our investment in pt inco at book value as of december  totalled million 
in addition  a lender to pt inco currently has the right  under certain circumstances  to require one of our wholly owned subsidiaries to purchase approximately million in 
table of contents debt extended to pt inco by that lender 
in  to meet pt inco s cash shortfalls attributable principally to the increase in the capital cost of the new hydroelectric facilities which were part of pt inco s expansion project  the relatively low nickel prices  and constraints on pt inco s production attributable to then reduced hydroelectric power generation caused by below average rainfall  we advanced million to pt inco 
these advances were effectively repaid in to the extent that pt inco would experience cash shortfalls in the future  particularly if there were to be a significant decline in primary nickel demand and nickel prices  we may again conclude that it would be necessary to advance cash to pt inco in order to meet pt inco s cash needs 
for  pt inco s production is expected to represent about one third of our total planned production 
the uncertain political situation and security concerns in indonesia  primarily as a result of the ongoing economic  political and social problems facing that country  could adversely affect pt inco s ability to operate 
based upon certain recent regulations and other developments relating to mining activities in areas designated as protected forests under legislation passed in indonesia in  pt inco could be restricted from mining in certain areas it is authorized to mine under its contract of work with the indonesian government and such a development could adversely affect pt inco s long term mine plans and overall production levels 
while there has been no indication that the government of the republic of indonesia is considering currency controls  nationalization of certain properties or facilities or other similar actions  regional and local governmental authorities have sought to take greater control of the development of their resources and these or other political developments  including  but not limited to  the possibility of disruptions in pt inco s operations arising out of the actions of non governmental organizations or community activist groups  could have a material adverse effect on pt inco s  and our overall  nickel production levels  business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow from operations 
risks associated with  and importance of  future low cost nickel projects as part of our strategy to be the world s lowest cost and most profitable nickel producer  we have continued our efforts to develop new low cost sources of nickel 
following the completion of the pt inco expansion project in late  we have focused  as discussed above  on our voisey s bay nickel copper cobalt project and our goro nickel cobalt project 
a number of risks and uncertainties are associated with the development of these projected low cost sources of nickel and other metals  including political  regulatory  design  construction  labour  operating  technical and technological risks  uncertainties relating to capital and other costs and financing risks and  in the case of goro  risks related to the possible future transition to independence of new caledonia 
there have been periodic attempts by certain local groups in the area of the goro project site to disrupt operations and activities at that site and related areas  including most recently in early while the local authorities took appropriate action in response to these recent disruptions  we cannot predict whether these local groups will continue to seek to disrupt such operations and activities and what effect  if any  such actions will have on the construction of the goro project 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties referred to above  there are certain issues that must be resolved to enable the commercial development of each of these projects to be realized 
for the goro project  we still need to receive all of the necessary construction  environmental and operating permits 
in the case of our voisey s bay project  we still need to receive certain approvals or permits before we can begin commercial production 
while we currently anticipate that we will be able to obtain all such remaining permits on a timely basis  any failure to obtain  or delay in the issuance of  such permits could adversely affect the start up of the voisey s bay project and the construction of the goro project 
in addition  we will need to continue to meet the terms and conditions under the definitive agreements covering the development of the voisey s bay project reached in october between the government of newfoundland and labrador and us  including the completion of construction of a demonstration plant to test hydrometallurgical processing technologies expected to be completed and in operation in late depending upon the levels of cash flows we are able to generate  we may also need to secure financing for the completion of the development of the second and third phases of the voisey s bay project and the goro project on acceptable terms 
in connection with the significant financing required for completion of the development of the goro project and the second and third phases of the voisey s bay project  we currently expect that  in order to be able to meet such financing needs  we could be required to borrow additional funds  issue additional equity  and or enter into strategic or other arrangements 
our current plans contemplate reaching definitive agreements under which sumitomo metal mining co  ltd 
and mitsui co  ltd 
would acquire up to a per cent interest in goro nickel sa and assume  subject to certain limitations  the obligation to fund their pro rata share of the capital costs of the goro project 
there can be no assurance that these financing and investment arrangements will be completed or that we will be able to raise additional required funds on acceptable terms when financing is needed for either project 
as discussed under uncertainty of production and capital and other cost estimates below  while we have certain potential new mine development projects at our existing operations in canada  as well as additional resources that could be developed in indonesia in addition to the voisey s bay and goro projects  if sufficient new low cost sources of nickel such as our voisey s bay project were not developed by us on a timely basis  we currently believe that our overall nickel production  particularly at our manitoba operations  could decline beginning as early as  and our nickel unit cost of production could increase significantly with any material decline 
table of contents in mine production from our ontario and manitoba operations if such operations were not significantly restructured 
these developments could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
uncertainty of production and capital and other cost estimates a decrease in the amount of and a change in the timing of our production outlook for the metals we produce  in particular nickel  will directly impact the amount and timing of our cash flow from operations 
a per cent reduction in the amount of consolidated planned production of all metals produced would decrease cash flows estimated for by approximately million based on metal prices and costs at december  the actual impact of such a decrease on such cash flow from operations would depend on the timing of any changes in production and on actual prices and costs 
in the case of our canadian and united kingdom operations  the time from initial production to collection of cash from the sale of nickel products produced by these operations is approximately weeks  while the time between production of copper and cash collection from copper sales is about weeks 
the production of most of our precious metals requires the transfer of precious metals containing materials to our acton refinery in the united kingdom and the processing time at that facility generally results in cash collection taking about weeks from first production of such materials in our ontario operations 
in the case of pt inco  the time between nickel in matte production  refining of that intermediate product through our asian refineries and collection of cash from the sale of such refined products is approximately weeks 
any change in the timing of these cash flows that would occur due to production shortfalls or labour disruptions would  in turn  result in delays in receipt of such cash flows and in using such cash to reduce debt levels and may require additional borrowings to fund capital expenditures  including capital for our development projects  in the future 
in addition  a number of these and other developments or events  including changes in credit terms  product mix  demand for our products and production disruptions  could make historic trends in our cash flows lose their predictive value 
the level of production and capital and operating cost estimates relating to our goro and voisey s bay projects and other projects  which are used in establishing ore mineral reserve estimates and for determining and obtaining financing and other purposes  are based on certain assumptions and are inherently subject to significant uncertainties 
it is very likely that actual results for our voisey s bay and goro projects will differ from our current estimates and assumptions  and these differences may be material 
in addition  as discussed below  experience from actual mining or processing operations may identify new or unexpected conditions which could reduce production below  and or increase capital and or operating costs above  our current estimates 
if actual results are less favorable than we currently estimate  our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely impacted 
goro in october  we announced that  having completed and successfully achieved the key objectives of the second  or phase  of the goro project review  we would proceed with the development of our goro nickel cobalt project in new caledonia 
a key objective of phase of the goro review was to achieve a reliable and acceptable capital cost estimate for the project 
this review  which proceeded in two phases  had begun following the decision made in december to suspend the project 
the final results of the review have included an updated capital cost estimate of  million for the mine  process plant and related infrastructure  within a minus per cent to plus per cent reliability range 
this estimate included million for mine  process plant and related infrastructure capital expenditures that had already been made through september  and which will continue to have use in the reconfigured project scope 
this capital cost estimate also included million for assumed escalation in costs during the construction phase of the project  an amount that was not in previous capital cost estimates  and also reflected favourable currency hedging gains realized by inco of about million which were also not included in previous estimates 
the principal reasons for the increase from the  million capital cost estimate we had announced on may  were for a range of construction materials and labour required for construction and the incorporation of a new tailings storage area as part of the project 
phase of the project review also focused on a number of other key objectives  including a viable project implementation schedule and clear project execution plan  a prudent financing plan taking into account our projected cash flow potential to fund our expected share of the capital costs of the project  an experienced and dedicated team for both the construction and operating phases and optimizing the goro project s planned process plant design and engineering requirements while also meeting specific objectives on project operability  maintainability  risk mitigation and environmental protection 
the final results of phase of the review met all of these key objectives 
consistent with the preliminary results of phase of the review announced in may  the project s process plant footprint area was reduced by approximately per cent from its original plan  reducing the quantities of bulk materials required  enhancing the efficiency of the planned process plant from an operational and maintenance perspective  and reducing any potentially adverse environmental effects 

table of contents in moving forward with goro  the project is expected to focus initially on engineering work  with mobilization for construction at the goro site expected to begin the second quarter of based upon the final results of phase of the review  the project construction schedule is currently estimated to be approximately months in length  with initial production estimated to begin in late we currently plan that  as part of the project schedule  the goro project would reach about per cent of its expected annual capacity of  tonnes of nickel within months after initial production  and would be at approximately per cent of that expected annual nickel capacity within two years after initial production 
as part of the results of the phase review  the goro project s expected cobalt capacity was revised to a current range of  to  tonnes per year to take into account the optimized mine plan for the project 
operations during  as mine production at our manitoba operations transitioned from the thompson mine to the lower grade birchtree mine  we experienced lower mine production 
we continued to experience such lower mine production in and  as this transition continues to move forward  we currently expect to see a continuing decline in mine production in manitoba in and expect to see further declines in future years 
we have recently been relying upon  and expect that we will continue to rely at least for  on an increasing basis  upon the availability of purchased nickel intermediates to maintain manitoba s nickel production at around the  tonne annual level 
we currently expect that  with the planned availability of voisey s bay intermediate nickel concentrate for processing at our manitoba operations beginning by late or early  these operations are expected to produce finished nickel products at or above the  tonne annual level over at least the period  after which we currently expect to see  absent the availability of other cost effective sources of intermediate product for processing  a decline in annual production beginning as early as we have relied upon two australian suppliers of purchased intermediates to maintain production at or near capacity principally at our manitoba and  to a lesser extent  at our ontario operations 
if these suppliers experienced problems in producing or shipping to canada their intermediate products  these events would have an adverse effect on our ability to produce and sell the nickel products we plan to produce in and would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
extended strikes  such as the one we experienced at our ontario operations in  other labour disruptions and unforeseen events could also adversely affect our production plans and costs and these developments could also adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
voisey s bay the current capital cost estimate for phase one of the voisey s bay project is million 
given that a significant portion of these costs have been  or will be  incurred in canadian dollars  we entered  as discussed under risks and uncertainties above  into canadian dollar derivative instruments for approximately per cent of the total expected costs in canadian dollars to be incurred in for the project s related assets 
construction risks and technological risks the mine  processing plant and related infrastructure required for the development of the voisey s bay and goro projects have not yet been constructed and no commercial mining has commenced 
while construction of the initial phase of the voisey s bay project is expected to be completed in the summer of  only certain of the necessary construction and other permits have been obtained in respect of the goro project 
while detailed exploration and related studies with respect to the goro project have been completed based on significant surface exploratory drilling  extensive investigations of certain of the mineralization delineated to date  construction and mine plans  and production and cost estimates  we are not currently in a position to predict with certainty when all of the required remaining approvals would be in place for us to complete construction of the first phase of the goro project by late unforeseen conditions or developments could arise during the construction period for either project which could delay or prevent completion  and or substantially increase the cost of construction of the necessary facilities and infrastructure to develop either project  in particular the goro project 
such events may include  without limitation  shortages of equipment  materials or labour  delays in delivery of equipment or materials  labour disruptions  political events  local or political opposition  civil disturbances  litigation  adverse weather conditions  unanticipated increases in costs  natural or man made disasters  accidents and unforeseen engineering  technical and technological  design  environmental  geological or geotechnical problems 
any delay in construction would delay the 
table of contents production of nickel and other products from the voisey s bay and or goro projects  and the expected significant source of revenue for us that production from these projects would represent 
any such delay could also materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our goro project will involve the application of new processing and other technologies and  depending upon the results of the hydrometallurgical research and development program we are conducting for our voisey s bay project  as described above  that project could also utilize new processing and other technologies to produce one or more refined or finished nickel products 
there can be no assurance that these technologies will be successfully developed and applied on a commercial basis or that the costs associated with and or the timing of their implementation will not have a material adverse effect on the timing of the start up of commercial production  the capital and or operating costs for either or both projects and on other factors impacting the profitability of these projects 
these events could materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
governmental regulations in addition to environmental regulations referred to above  the mining and metals industry in canada operates under federal  provincial and municipal legislation  regulation and intervention by governments in such matters as land tenure  limitations on areas in which mining can be conducted  production rates  income and other taxes and the export of ore and other products  as well as other matters 
our operations in indonesia  the united kingdom  new caledonia and in other countries outside canada are also subject to various environmental and other applicable laws and regulations and governmental interventions  some of which are similar to those in canada and all of which are subject to change 
the mining and metals industry is also subject to regulation and intervention by governments in such matters as control over the development and abandonment of mine sites including restrictions on production and possible expropriation or cancellation of contract and mineral rights 
before proceeding with major projects  including significant changes to existing operations  we must obtain certain regulatory approvals 
the regulatory approval process can involve stakeholder consultation  environmental impact assessments and public hearings  among other things 
in addition  regulatory approvals may be subject to conditions  including the obligation to post security deposits and other financial commitments 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals  or failure to obtain them on a timely basis  could result in delays and abandonment or restructuring of projects and increased costs  all of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flows 
in addition  such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions  and the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the mining and metals industry could increase our costs and have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with all applicable laws or regulations at all times or that steps to bring us into compliance would not materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
reference is made to risks and uncertainties environmental risks above 
capital requirements and operating risks as discussed under cash flows  liquidity and capital resources and off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations above  each of our two current principal primary metals business units  the canadian and united kingdom operations and pt inco  has required  and is expected to continue to require  certain levels of investment to sustain their current levels of production 
for  as discussed under outlook planned capital expenditures below  we currently forecast capital expenditures totalling approximately  million  covering sustaining capital expenditures for our current primary metals business units as well as planned expenditures for our goro and voisey s bay projects and other development projects 
this total amount assumes a level of capital expenditures  including capitalized interest  in for our goro project of million and million for our voisey s bay project 
to meet such capital expenditures requirements for and at least for in the case of the goro project and for our pt inco program to increase its production as discussed above given the current projected total capital expenditures for these development projects and programs  we must generate sufficient internal cash flows and or be able to utilize available financing sources 
if we do not realize satisfactory prices for the nickel and other metals that we produce  we could be required to raise very significant additional capital through the capital markets and or incur significant borrowings to meet our capital requirements 
these financing requirements could adversely affect our credit ratings and our ability to access the capital markets in the future to meet any external financing requirements we might have 
if there are significant delays in when these projects are completed and are producing on a commercial and consistent scale  and or their capital costs were to be significantly higher than estimated  these events could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operation  cash flow from operations and financial condition 

table of contents in addition  our mining operations and processing and related infrastructure facilities are subject to risks normally encountered in the mining and metals industry 
such risks include  without limitation  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  labour disputes  changes in laws  technical difficulties or failures  late delivery of supplies or equipment  unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures  cave ins  pit wall failures  rock falls  unanticipated ground  grade or water conditions  flooding  periodic or extended interruptions due to the unavailability of materials and force majeure events 
such risks could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or producing facilities  personal injury  environmental damage  delays in mining or processing  losses and possible legal liability 
any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at our mining or processing operations could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the wholesale electricity markets in ontario were deregulated for a portion of and as a result we have experienced fluctuations in some of our electricity costs at the ontario operations 
the ontario government announced new electricity rates for industrial users in february these new rates are between to per cent higher than rates that prevailed in and are effective as of april  depending upon future changes in the regulatory environment for electricity markets  we could experience future fluctuations in such costs 
we have from time to time experienced adverse production and production cost trends at our operations in canada and elsewhere and could experience similar adverse trends in the future 
labour relations new collective agreements with unionized hourly production and maintenance workers at our ontario operations were entered into on august  and will expire on may  these agreements were reached following a three month strike that had a material adverse effect on our production of nickel  copper and certain other metals and our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flow from operations for a three year collective agreement with our unionized office  clerical and technical employees at our ontario operations was negotiated in the first quarter of and remains in effect until march  on september   a new three year collective agreement with our unionized workers at our manitoba operations was successfully negotiated 
that agreement expires in september we cannot predict at this time whether we will be able to enter into a new collective agreement without a labour disruption when the current agreement expires 
our pt inco subsidiary entered into a new two year collective labour agreement with its union in the fourth quarter of which expires in december while there were no significant problems in reaching this latest agreement with pt inco s labour force  with the increased potential for actions of non government organizations and other activist groups  the continuing uncertain economic and political situation in indonesia and the general increase in labour activism in that country  there can be no assurance that such activism will not adversely affect pt inco s ability to successfully operate 
any disruption in pt inco s operations as a result of labour issues or other issues may adversely affect its operations and could materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
at goro  we currently have two unions representing some of our employees 
in early september  goro experienced labour disruptions by personnel associated with certain project construction subcontractors 
as a result of these disruptions  the decision was made in late september to curtail certain activities at the project s site to enable the project company  goro nickel sa  contractors  subcontractors and other interested parties to develop procedures to avoid future disruptions 
a number of procedures were put in place prior to the start of the goro project comprehensive review in late and over the past two years we have been seeking to complete the implementation of these and other procedures as part of the negotiation of labour  site or other accords to help minimize any such disruptions in the future 
through an employer s association  of which we are the controlling member  we negotiated a collective agreement effective september covering the construction of the first phase of the voisey s bay project 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain positive relationships with our employees at our operations in canada  indonesia and elsewhere or that new collective agreements will be entered into without work interruptions as in the case of the three month strike at our ontario operations in we could also be adversely affected by labour disruptions involving third parties who may provide us with goods or services at our operations in canada and elsewhere 
for example  as discussed above  our goro project experienced labour disruptions by certain employees of the project s construction subcontractors 
strikes and other labour disruptions at any of our operations and lengthy work interruptions at our goro and or voisey s bay projects could materially adversely affect the timing of completion and the cost of either project  as well as our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
uncertainty of ore mineral reserve estimates our reported ore mineral reserves as of december  are estimated quantities of proven and probable ore that  under present and anticipated conditions  can be legally and economically mined and processed by the extraction of their mineral content 
the volume and grade of reserves actually recovered and rates of production from our present ore mineral reserves may be less than geological measurements of the reserves 
furthermore  market price fluctuations in nickel  other metals and exchange rates  and 
table of contents changes in operating and capital costs may in the future render certain ore mineral reserves uneconomic to mine and could  accordingly  result in significant reductions in our reported estimates of proven and probable ore mineral reserves 
we determine the amount of our estimated ore mineral reserves in accordance with the requirements of the applicable securities regulatory authorities and established industry practices 
to the extent that we are required by regulatory authorities to change the metal prices  expenditures and other assumptions we use in preparing these estimates  then these estimates could change significantly 
no assurance can be given that the indicated amount of ore will be recovered or that it will be recovered at the rates anticipated by us 
our ore mineral reserve estimates are based on limited sampling and  consequently  are uncertain because the samples may not be representative of the entire orebody 
as more knowledge and understanding of the orebody is obtained  the reserve estimates may change significantly  either positively or negatively 
sensitivities our financial results are sensitive to  among other things  changes in prices for nickel and other metals  the canadian us dollar exchange rate and interest rates 
our financial results are also affected by changes in the indonesian rupiah us dollar exchange rate  but to a lesser extent since pt inco s revenues and many of its expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we have calculated the impact on our basic net earnings per share of a per cent change in the market risk exposures that we believe have the most significant impact on our net earnings 
the following table shows the approximate full year impact of a per cent change in our principal market risk exposures on our basic net earnings per share based on planned deliveries of inco source metals and after taking into consideration our principal derivative instrument positions as of december  these market risk exposures have been selected as management believes they have had  and are currently expected to continue to have  the most significant impact on our net earnings per share impact on basic net sensitivities as of december  change earnings per share metals nickel per pound copper per pound cobalt per pound platinum per troy ounce palladium per troy ounce energy fuel oil per bbl natural gas per mm btu currencies us per cdn cents us per indonesian rupiah per thousand cents share appreciation rights per share canadian gaap basic net earnings per share 
each sensitivity assumes other factors are held constant 
as indicated in the table above  the most significant sensitivities in terms of the effect on our basic net earnings per share are nickel prices and the canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate 
cash expenditures for our development projects will be incurred primarily in canadian dollars for our voisey s bay project and in australian dollars and euros for our goro project 
although changes in these currencies will affect the ultimate carrying value of the related assets in us dollar terms  they will not have any impact on our earnings until such projects are fully developed and operating 
a per cent change in each of the value of the australian dollar and euro relative to the us dollar as at december  would change currently planned capital expenditures for the goro project by million and million  respectively  after taking into consideration outstanding derivative contracts as at december  a per cent change in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar at december  would change planned capital expenditures for the voisey s bay project by million after taking into consideration outstanding derivative instruments as at december  reference is made to foreign exchange risk under risks and uncertainties above

each sensitivity assumes other factors are held constant 
while the sensitivity analyses presented in the tables above represent our best estimate of the impact of specified assumed changes in the identified market risk scenarios  actual results could differ from those reflected 
the sensitivity analyses presented are subject to various limitations and uncertainties which may affect the impact on basic net earnings per share 
these sensitivity analyses have been prepared based on a change of per cent in the market rates or prices at december  and the impact on basic net earnings per share has been determined based on discrete changes in the identified risks 
if there are changes in two or more of the identified risks  the above impact on basic net earnings per share may not accurately reflect the actual impact on our net earnings per share 
these sensitivity analyses also include assumptions relating to our current projected operations during in the case of the sensitivity analyses as of december  and our original plan for in the case of the sensitivity analysis as of december  as we are affected and influenced by changes in the business and economic environments in which we operate  the changes reflected in the sensitivity analyses above may be different or may prove to be inaccurate  including in relation to their impact on basic net earnings per share 
the most significant assumptions which may be affected relate to levels of production  consumption rates  forecasted costs of production  tax rates and deliveries 
these sensitivity analyses provided are not intended to fully reflect the net market risk exposures since certain exposures would encompass events that are uncertain or could not be foreseen 
some of these events are outlined in our discussion above on risks and uncertainties affecting our business 
for example  with respect to metal prices  extended declines in prices  particularly nickel prices  due to unusual economic developments or other unforeseen events would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  unusual or irrational actions by competitors could  for example  change the nickel market supply demand relationship and other factors fundamental to our business causing declines in metal prices 
in addition  significant and prolonged increases in energy prices and or the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar would have a material adverse effect on our costs of production  results of operations and financial condition 
there are also a wide range of other uncertainties in the business environment that could result in material limitations with respect to the accuracy of the sensitivity analyses for net market risk exposures  including cost inflation  relations with our employees  avoidance of major accidents at our producing locations  and the average grades of ore mined and the certainty of estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves at our operations 
unanticipated changes in environmental laws and regulations could also result in limits on production and or significantly increased capital spending to meet such changes 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
critical accounting estimates are those that require us to make assumptions about matters a that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  b for which we could have reasonably used a different estimate in the current period and or c where changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and such changes would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
our estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we 
table of contents believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our ongoing evaluation of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates  is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting estimates and underlying judgments  estimates and assumptions have been reviewed with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
depreciation and depletion expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the declining balance or straight line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment 
these lives do not exceed the estimated operating mine life based upon estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves unless we believe the asset can be utilized in another facility after the mining operations have ended 
depletion of the deferred costs of mine development is calculated on a units of production basis over the estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves which relate to the particular category of development  either life of mine plan or estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves for which no further capital expenditures are required 
no future development costs are taken into account in calculating the amortization charge 
life of mine plan development comprises capital expenditures that will be utilized in the extraction of all the estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves in the current detailed mine plan 
these expenditures are predominantly incurred up front and in advance of any ore extraction or in advance of major expansions 
the types of development included in this category include ore haulage shafts  initial decline  ore passes and chutes and underground ore crusher cavities and are intended to be used for the extraction of all ore within the current mine plan 
these costs are depleted on a units of production basis over the total estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves in the current mine plan 
development costs  which are depleted over estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves for which no further capital is required  consist of capital expenditures to provide access to various areas within the mine to allow the extraction of ore to commence 
the types of development costs that are within this category include access and perimeter drives  ventilation drives and rises  and progressive declining subsequent to initial contact with the ore body 
these costs are depleted on a units of production basis over the estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves that can be currently accessed without future capital development costs being incurred 
the calculation of the units of production rate of depletion and  accordingly  the annual depletion charge to operations  could be materially affected to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves 
this would generally be the case where there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in estimating proven and probable ore mineral reserves 
these factors could include i an expansion of estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves through exploration activities  ii differences between estimated and actual cash costs of mining  due to differences in grade  metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates from those assumed  and iii differences between actual commodity prices and the commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of proven and probable ore mineral reserves 
such changes in estimated ore mineral reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight line basis  where those lives are limited to the life of the mine 
the accounting estimates related to depreciation and depletion are critical accounting estimates and are influenced by our estimates of proven and probable ore mineral reserves 
historically  the company has been successful in replacing a portion of the ore mineral reserves depleted through mining operations 
during the past six years  excluding major development projects  on average about per cent of the aggregate ore mined from our sulphide mineral deposits has been replaced through further exploration and development activities 
depreciation and depletion charges are adjusted prospectively based on annual year end assessments of company s proven and probable ore mineral reserves 
if our estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves were to be decreased by per cent  there would be an increase of million in our annual depletion expense 
impairment we review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted 
table of contents estimated future cash flows 
future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals  expected commodity prices considering current and historical prices  price trends and related factors  production levels  cash costs of production  capital and reclamation costs  all based on detailed life of mine plans 
the term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of nickel or other commodities that will be obtained from proven and probable ore mineral reserves and all related mineral interests  after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  which include inherent risks and uncertainties 
the assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions that influence these factors 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events  and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if other assumptions and estimates had been used in the current period  the balances for non current assets could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
in estimating future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups  taking into consideration movements of intermediate products to ensure the utilization of available capacity across our operations 
all assets at a particular operation are considered together for purposes of estimating future cash flows 
we periodically review our equity method investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the carrying amount is other than temporary 
in making this determination  we consider a number of factors related to the financial condition and prospects of the investee  including i a decline in the valuation of the equity investee for an extended period of time  ii an inability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the equity investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment  and iii the period of time over which we intend to hold the investment 
if the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  the carrying value is written down to fair value 
in situations where the fair value of an investment is not evident due to a lack of a public market price or other factors  we use our best estimates and assumptions to arrive at the estimated fair value of such investment  based on future cash flows of the equity investee and other relevant factors 
as significant judgment is required in assessing these factors  it is possible that changes in any of these factors in the future could result in an other than temporary decline in value of an equity investment and could require us to record an impairment charge to operations in future periods 
in  we recorded an impairment loss in respect of our goro project in the amount of million 
this loss was determined based on management s judgment regarding the net realizable value for supplies and equipment that no longer had any use for the project 
a per cent reduction in the assumed net recoverable value for these items would have increased the impairment charge by million 
there were no impairment losses on long lived assets recorded in in  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of  million relating to the voisey s bay project and certain other assets as set forth in the table below 
at the time these impairment charges were recorded  canadian gaap required the impairment loss to be measured as the difference between the net recoverable amount  versus the fair value  as compared to carrying value 
for further information  reference is made to note f to our consolidated financial statements 
such change was required to be applied prospectively 
asset impairment charge millions voisey s bay project victor deep project ontario write off of accounts and notes receivable write down of production assets other total the impairment loss with respect to the voisey s bay project was determined using the following assumptions a revenue assumptions for purposes of estimating future cash flows were based on the same commodity prices and exchange rates used to estimate proven and probable ore mineral reserves at the end of as follows nickel per pound lme 
table of contents cash nickel price  copper per pound  cobalt per pound reduced from per pound used to estimate proven and probable ore mineral reserves at the end of and a long term us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate of  b the estimated production of nickel and copper concentrates were based on a concentrator operation capable of producing concentrate sufficient to refine on average million pounds of nickel per year 
initial processing of the nickel concentrate has been assumed to be done at our ontario and manitoba operations for a period of years while hydrometallurgical processing facilities are developed and built in the province of newfoundland and labrador 
thereafter processing has been assumed to occur at these new hydrometallurgical facilities  c these production levels were based on initial production from currently established estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves followed by production from underground sources where it has been assumed that estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves would be established by the start of underground mining anticipated to occur in  estimates of the quantity of ore and grade that may be contained in such underground sources  the cost of mining such ore and the capital cost of mine development are subject to considerable uncertainty  and d the cost of operations were developed based on the definitive agreements entered into by us with the province of newfoundland and labrador that established the project scope  tax regime applicable to the project and the size and nature of the production facilities  among other things 
operating costs for mining and processing operations were developed based on our experience in mining and processing similar ores at our ontario and manitoba operations 
where production processes called for the use of new technology  cost estimates were developed by our technical personnel involved in the development of the process technologies 
estimated costs associated with the impacts and benefits agreements entered into between us and two aboriginal groups were also taken into consideration in developing the overall cost of operations 
the estimated proven and probable ore mineral reserves for the voisey s bay project were based on a feasibility study prepared in and have been supported by additional exploration work and evaluations since that time 
subsequent to the impairment evaluation  we completed a bankable feasibility study for the initial phase of the voisey s bay project that includes construction of an open pit mine and concentrator  a port and related infrastructure development 
construction of the initial phase of our voisey s bay project is well underway as described above 
asset retirement obligations our mining operations involve activities that have a significant effect on the area surrounding such operations 
we estimated our ultimate reclamation and closure costs on an undiscounted basis would total  million 
effective january   we adopted cica  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
cica requires that we record the fair value of our estimated asset retirement obligations when a legal obligation is incurred 
these liabilities are accreted to full value over time through charges to income 
the accounting estimates related to reclamation and closure costs are critical accounting estimates because i we will not incur most of these costs for a number of years  requiring us to make estimates over a relatively long period  ii reclamation and closure laws and regulations could change in the future or circumstances affecting our operations could change  either of which could result in significant changes to our current plans and future costs  iii calculating the fair value of our asset retirement obligations requires management to make long term assumptions about inflation rates  to determine our long term credit adjusted  risk free interest rates and to determine market risk premiums that are appropriate for our operations over long periods of time  and iv given the magnitude of our estimated reclamation and closure costs  changes in any or all of these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and or our financial condition 
to calculate the fair value of these obligations  we discounted the projected cash flows at our estimated credit adjusted  risk free interest rates which ranged from two per cent to eight per cent for the corresponding time periods over which these costs would be incurred 
the inflation rates and discount rates we used to calculate the fair value of our asset retirement obligations are critical factors in the calculation of future value and discounted present value costs 
we estimated the cash flows for asset retirement obligations assuming a single set of assumptions 
in general  given the nature of our business and specificity of our assets  there are very restrictive ways in which to retire our assets and conform to the applicable environmental regulations  including closure and related requirements 
therefore  in such instances  a range of likely outcomes was not used because multiple approaches to retire our assets were not appropriate 
we applied a market risk premium to the total obligations to reflect what a third party might demand to assume our asset retirement obligations 
the market risk premium was based on market based estimates of rates that a third party would have to pay to ensure its exposure to possible future increases in the value of these obligations 
the extent and timing of 
table of contents expenditures on closure and reclamation activities are critical estimates for the determination of our asset retirement obligations and the related annual charges to earnings 
these are also influenced by our estimates of our proven and probable ore mineral reserves 
as the closure period for a substantial portion of our mines is not for a number of years  we have no historical experience which would indicate that our current asset retirement obligations are either understated or overstated 
we continue to believe that our current closure cost estimates represent our best estimates 
in  we did update our closure plan for pt inco 
the update of this closure plan resulted in an increase of our asset retirement obligation of approximately million 
since our pt inco operations are not scheduled to close for many years  there was no significant impact of this increase on our results of operations 
if we were to advance the date of retirement of our assets by per cent from our current estimate  the impact would be an increase in our asset retirement obligations of million and the annual charge to earnings would have increased by million per year 
if our estimates of the cost of closure and reclamation activities were to change by per cent  our ultimate reclamation and closure costs would change by million 
in addition  there are certain environmental issues pertaining to former industrial sites that were retained by us relating to former businesses that had been sold by us 
in determining whether a liability exists in respect of these environmental issues  we apply the criteria for liability recognition set forth in applicable accounting standards 
we regularly review the status of environmental issues to determine whether a liability should be established or an additional liability recognized with the corresponding charge to our earnings 
future employee benefits and costs pension expense is determined separately for each of our pension plans and other post retirement arrangements based on the principles outlined in both canadian and united states accounting standards 
assets are valued using a market related value  determined based on the current market value and the market values in the previous four years that is  with an averaging of experience gains and losses over the five year period 
the expected return on assets assumption is based on current bond yields  an expected equity risk premium and an allowance for expected value added as a result of active management  where applicable 
as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements  we determine our return on plan assets using a formula approach 
each year we update our return on plan assets for the most recent historical benchmarks 
application of the respective historical benchmarks to our formula resulted in a decrease in the assumed rate of return on assets from per cent in to per cent in and to per cent for liabilities are determined as a present value of future anticipated cash flows using a discount rate based on corporate aa bond yields at the valuation date and an inflation expectation consistent with the corporate aa bond yield curve 
differences between the estimated future results and actual future results are amortized to the extent that the cumulative experience gain or loss is in excess of the permitted per cent corridor under canadian gaap over the expected average remaining service life of the active members earsl 
this per cent corridor  as defined by canadian gaap  represents per cent of the greater of the post retirement benefits obligations and the fair value of plan assets 
the return on assets assumption and the discount rate  salary and inflation assumptions used to value the liabilities are reviewed annually and are determined based on a consistent framework from year to year 
the most significant risk is that the assumptions will prove to be either too high or too low in the long term 
it is reasonable to assume that there will be a significant variation between the assumptions which are set within the framework of a long term commitment and actual experience in any one year 
over the long term  cumulative pension expense is expected to produce an appropriate reflection of the costs associated with the pension program 
the expense for other post retirement benefits or non pension benefits is based on a similar methodology and similar determination of the liability value 
the discount rate used is the same as that determined for the pension obligations 
the inflation rate assumed for medical costs is based on our history of healthcare spending 
the assumption for the ultimate health care trend rates relates to the overall economic trends 
with this reasoning  the ultimate trend rate is comprised of the assumed inflation rate  real gross domestic product growth of per cent to per cent and health care expenditure growth rate at a slightly higher rate over the long term 
we currently estimate that a per cent increase or decrease in the return on assets assumption would result in a corresponding million decrease or increase  in annual pension expense 
changes to the return on assets assumption would have no significant effect on required funding requirements  as our required contributions are primarily determined based on the applicable canadian regulatory solvency funding requirements that is  the windup valuation 
under this valuation methodology  liabilities for solvency valuation are based on market bond yields and the excess of liabilities over assets must be amortized over a five year period 
we estimate that a per cent increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a corresponding million decrease or increase in annual pension expense 
since we are currently contributing more than the minimum requirements under applicable 
table of contents pension standards legislation and we currently plan to continue to do so over at least the next few years  long term bond yields would need to decline by more than one per cent from current levels to require any increase in contributions 
income and mining taxes significant judgment  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the company s consolidated tax provision 
in addition  in evaluating the ability of the company to realize the deferred tax assets  significant judgment  estimates and assumptions are required in establishing deferred income tax asset valuation allowances 
the provision or relief for income and mining taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
the objectives of accounting for income and mining taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in determining both the current and future components of income and mining taxes  we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions  recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes would be payable as well as make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of future tax assets and liabilities 
if our interpretations differ from those of tax authorities or if the timing of reversals is not as anticipated  the provision or relief for income and mining taxes could increase or decrease in future periods 
in estimating deferred income and mining tax assets  a valuation allowance is determined to reduce the future income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
this valuation allowance for amounted to million  representing i million in respect of non capital losses available to goro nickel sa  ii million in respect of net capital losses available in the united kingdom  iii million in respect of reduction in the benefits of write downs of certain investments and iv million reduction in the benefit of alternative minimum tax relating to our subsidiaries in the united states 
this valuation allowance for amounted to million  representing i million in respect of non capital losses available to goro nickel sa  ii million in respect of net capital losses available in the united states and united kingdom  and iii million in respect of unrealized capital losses arising from the write down of certain investments and other assets 
in  the valuation allowance was million  representing i million in respect of non capital losses for goro nickel sa  ii million in respect of net capital losses in the united states and united kingdom  iii million in respect of unrealized capital losses arising from the write down of certain investments and other assets  and iv million in respect of accrued unrealized foreign exchange losses on foreign currency denominated long term debt 
these valuation allowances have been provided for as it is more likely than not that these non capital and net capital losses will not be realized for tax purposes in the future 
in each year  the amount of the valuation allowance reduces the future income tax assets and effectively increases the amount of the net deferred income tax liabilities and  accordingly  the provision for income and mining taxes on the earnings statement 
additional information regarding our accounting for income and mining taxes is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting changes in  we adopted three new accounting pronouncements for the purposes of our canadian gaap reporting 
these new pronouncements related to the accounting for variable interest entities  the application of canadian gaap and hedging relationships 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we adopted a substantially similar standard with respect to variable interest entities for united states gaap 
in  we also changed our methodology used to calculate depletion and depreciation expense 
a similar change was made for united states gaap reporting effective january   therefore  the adoption of this change for canadian gaap purposes eliminated a significant gaap difference between united states and canadian gaap 
for further information on these accounting changes and the impact on our consolidated financial statements  reference should be made to note a  b  c and d to our consolidated financial statements 
also  for united states reporting purposes  effective december  on a retroactive basis  we adopted eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
for further information on this change  reference should be made to note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  we have adopted two new accounting pronouncements for the purposes of canadian gaap reporting 
effective january   on a retroactive basis  we have adopted revisions to cica section  earnings per share 
the revisions relate primarily to the use of year to date weighted average rates when applying the treasury stock method and instruments where  if an instrument can be settled in cash or shares  an entity should assume that the instrument will be settled in shares if share settlement is more dilutive 
in and prior years  we presumed  with respect to our lyon convertible notes  cash settlement and  accordingly  this instrument was not considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
the impact of adopting these revisions will be a decrease in diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  of cents per share 
also  effective january   on 
table of contents a retroactive basis  we have adopted revisions to cica section  financial instruments disclosure and presentation 
the revisions relate to the accounting for instruments for which the issuer has the right to settle in cash or its own shares 
such an instrument should be bifurcated between debt and equity in accordance with the revised standard 
this change will impact the accounting treatment for our lyon convertible notes  convertible debentures due and subordinated convertible debentures due which are currently treated as equity in accordance with eic  financial instruments that may be settled at the issuer s option in cash or its own equity instruments 
consistent with this change  it will be necessary to record interest expense in lieu of accretion charges with respect to these convertible debt securities 
the impact on our balance sheet as at december  will be an increase in long term debt of million  an increase in deferred income and mining taxes of million  a decrease in convertible debt classified as equity of million  an increase in deferred charges of million and a reduction in retained earnings of million 
in addition  as these revisions will result in the retroactive restatement of our interest expense  there will also be an increase in the amount of interest capitalized to date in respect of our development projects in the amount of million 
for a complete discussion of current and future accounting changes as they relate to our united states gaap reporting  reference is made to note to our consolidated financial statements 
outlook we continue to pursue our goal of being the world s most profitable nickel producer through our three part strategy of maintaining low cost operations focused on high margin production  pursuing profitable growth and enhancing our strong global marketing position  including the development and sale of value added products 
our two major development projects  voisey s bay and goro  are currently expected to have a significant effect on our future results of operations  financial condition and cash flow from operations 
operations our nickel production is currently expected to be in the range of  to  tonnes to million pounds  down from the  tonnes million pounds level in we did not have a scheduled maintenance shutdown at our ontario operations in  but consistent with our current plan to have such a shutdown at these operations every eighteen months  we are planning a one month maintenance shutdown in the second quarter of such a shutdown would be expected to reduce our annual nickel production by about million pounds  our annual copper production by million pounds and our annual pgms production by about  troy ounces from levels at these operations if there were no shutdown 
an annual four week shutdown is also planned at our manitoba operations in and will also include a week furnace rebuild 
we expect our purchases of nickel intermediates to increase by per cent from levels to approximately  tonnes million pounds in this external feed source is expected to represent the source of about per cent of planned finished nickel production  up from  tonnes million pounds or per cent in we continue to use purchased nickel intermediates to increase the processing capacity utilization of our ontario and manitoba operations  as discussed under risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties above  and to maintain finished nickel production at the manitoba operations at or near its  tonne annual capacity 
while such use is profitable  it does increase our costs  particularly at higher nickel prices since the cost of purchased nickel intermediates is based on prevailing lme cash nickel or other benchmark prices 
with the expected significant volume of intermediate nickel product to be produced from voisey s bay in  these concentrates will replace such concentrate and are currently expected to enable our manitoba operations to maintain or exceed its current annual production capacity of  metric tonnes over the period 
copper production for is currently expected to be approximately  tonnes million pounds in  down nine per cent from  tonnes million pounds in total production of pgms is expected to decrease to  troy ounces in from the level of  troy ounces 
as discussed under labour relations above  the current collective agreement covering our manitoba unionized workforce expires in september if a new agreement cannot be successfully negotiated without a labour disruption  such an event could have a material adverse effect on our production for the fourth quarter of and our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
planned capital expenditures our capital expenditures are currently expected to total  million before any contributions that may be made by new shareholders in goro nickel sa and receipt of certain government assistance under programs relating to our development projects 

table of contents this estimate includes  as discussed above  approximately million for the voisey s bay project  including capitalized interest and million to be spent at the ontario and manitoba operations for facilities to handle voisey s bay concentrate  approximately million  including capitalized interest  for the goro project  million for the program to increase production at pt inco  approximately million in sustaining capital expenditures for existing operations and million for environmental measures 
total depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses are currently projected to be million in  including an estimated million in respect of the voisey s bay project given that it is expected to commence operation in the later part of depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses for the voisey s bay operations are currently expected to increase from the million level for to about million for  reflecting depreciation of the facilities and equipment  depletion and amortization of the acquisition cost of the voisey s bay deposits for the full year 
nickel market conditions the stainless steel industry  the principal end use market for nickel  has been making significant investments to increase production capacity to meet continued demand growth 
demand for stainless steel is currently expected to remain strong over at least the next few years based upon the expected strong growth in world demand  in particular continued strong demand growth in china and other parts of asia 
strong nickel demand  driven by china and such non stainless steel uses as the aerospace market  coupled with low inventories  tighter scrap conditions and limited production growth  are currently expected to result in relatively high and volatile nickel prices in with most nickel producers having operated at or near capacity in and taking into account that there currently exists  we believe  no shutdown capacity available to be restarted and with the latest round of expansions to existing production capacity having been completed in  we currently estimate that  as discussed above  there will be an insufficient amount of additional nickel supply prior to at least to meet the expected growth in underlying nickel demand 
as discussed under labour relations above  we cannot predict whether we will be able to enter into a new collective agreement covering our manitoba operations without a labour disruption when the current agreement expires in september nickel demand in is currently anticipated to be relatively strong for several reasons 
first  the production of nickel containing stainless steel in china is expected to continue to increase due to the ramp up in production of several large stainless production facilities in that country 
nickel demand growth in china is expected to be supported by the absence of large primary nickel and secondary stainless steel scrap inventories  which we believe adversely impacted primary nickel demand growth in china in for  the currently projected strong nickel demand in china is expected to be complemented by the continued economic strength in other asia regions as well as in the united states 
second  the recovery of the aerospace industry and strength in the oil and gas market are expected to generate an increase in demand for nickel based alloys and  in turn  nickel 
third  reported nickel inventories  both producer and lme  are at very low levels relative to prior nickel cycles 
we currently estimate that inventory levels at december  represented approximately four weeks of demand  which is considered very low 
fourth  the availability of nickel containing stainless steel scrap  as an alternative source of nickel for the stainless steel industry  is not expected to keep pace with demand growth in this expected supply demand imbalance is due to the strong growth experienced in the usage and liquidation of inventories of such scrap in  which we believe will not be sustainable 
non gaap financial measure we have referred to nickel unit cash cost of sales before and after by product credits because we understand that certain investors use this information to assess our performance and also determine our ability to generate cash flow for use in investing activities 
the inclusion of these two unit cost measurements  nickel unit cash cost of sales before and after by product credits  enables investors to better understand our year to year changes in production costs using metrics that reflect our key ongoing cash production costs which  in turn  affect our profitability and cash flows 
these measurements capture all of the important components of our production and related costs 
the reason for providing the nickel unit cash cost of sales on the basis of before as well as after by product credits is to allow investors to see the impact on these metrics of changes in copper  cobalt and precious metals contributions which have historically largely been driven by the prices for these metals 
in addition  as discussed above  management utilizes these metrics as an important management tool to monitor cost performance of each of our key operations relative to planned and prior period results
