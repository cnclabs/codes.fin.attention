item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide assistance in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information in this section should be read with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this form k 
our results of operations are primarily dependent on our net interest income 
net interest income is a function of the balances of loans and investments outstanding in any one period  the yields earned on those loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds that were outstanding in that same period 
to a lesser extent  the relative levels of our non interest income and operating expenses also affect our results of operations 
our other income consists primarily of fees and service charges  and to a lesser extent  gains losses on the sale of loans and investments 
the other expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing costs  marketing costs  professional fees  office supplies  telephone and postage costs 
our results of operations are significantly impacted by the amount of provisions for loan losses which  in turn  are dependent upon  among other things  the size and makeup of the loan portfolio  loan quality and loan trends 
our results of operations are affected by general economic  regulatory and competitive conditions  including changes in prevailing interest rates and the policies of regulatory agencies 
forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements that project our future operations  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in these forward looking statements 
forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies and expectations of the company  are generally identified by the use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar expressions 
the company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
the company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
business strategy our business strategy has been to operate as a well capitalized  independent financial institution  dedicated to providing convenient access and quality service at competitive prices 
generally  we have sought to implement this strategy by maintaining a substantial part of our assets in loans secured by one to four family residential real estate located in our market area  and home equity and consumer loans 
in recent years  we have sought to diversify our loan portfolio with emphasis on shorter maturities and adjustable rate products 
at the same time  we have sought to expand our deposit base  particularly core deposits 
to the extent that new deposits have exceeded loan originations  we have invested these funds primarily in investment securities 
we have also availed ourselves of leveraged borrowings for purposes of temporarily financing our growth 
we intend to continue to emphasize a variety of loan products consisting of one to four family mortgages  home equity loans  multi family non residential mortgages  commercial and consumer loans 
during recent years  we have significantly increased our origination of automobile loans  multi family non residential mortgage loans  and commercial loans within our market area 
we began to originate automobile loans through an internet source in late and multi family non residential mortgage loans in in the most recent fiscal year  we have expanded our activity in commercial lending 
as of december   we had total automobile loans of million  multi family non residential loans of million  and commercial loans of million 
we intend to grow our branch office network  which will expand our geographic reach  and will consider the acquisition of other financial institutions 
we do not  however  have any current understandings  agreements or arrangements for the expansion of our business  other than opening new branch office locations 
as of december   we operated eighteen branch offices including our main office in middlesex  monmouth  morris  and union counties  new jersey 
synergy has plans to open three new branches and relocate one branch office in we also intend to open three new branch offices in the following year 
we will continue to evaluate our business beyond traditional retail banking

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with the accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for credit losses 
the company recognizes that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic events and conditions and other pertinent factors  including management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
intangible assets 
intangible assets such as goodwill and the core deposit intangible associated with the first bank of central jersey acquisition in january  are subject to annual impairment tests and  in the case of the core deposit intangible  amortization of the asset through a charge to expense 
to the extent the outcome of the impairment tests differ from the carrying value  additional charges to expense could be required to reduce the carrying value to fair value  which would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
the realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance provided for that portion of the asset for which the allowance is more likely than not to be realized 
if management determines that the company may be unable to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  a direct charge to income tax expense may be required to reduce the recorded value of the net deferred tax assets to the expected realizable amount  thereby impacting earnings

liquidity and capital resources we maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet liquidity needs 
the liquidity of a savings institution reflects its ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  accommodate possible outflows in deposits  fund current and planned expenditures and take advantage of market opportunities in connection with asset and liability management objectives 
funding of loan requests  providing for liability outflows  and management of interest rate fluctuations require continuous analysis in order to match the maturities of earning assets with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
savings institution liquidity is normally considered in terms of the nature and mix of the savings institution s sources and uses of funds 
our primary sources of liquidity are deposits  and scheduled amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  we invest excess funds in overnight federal funds investments  which provide liquidity 
our cash and cash equivalents  defined as cash and deposits in other financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less  totaled million at december  to a lesser extent  the earnings and funds provided from our operating activities are a source of liquidity  as well 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  we have the ability to obtain advances from the fhlb  which provides an additional source of funds 
at december   our borrowing limit with the fhlb was million  excluding repurchase agreement advances 
at december   we had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding and million in repurchase agreement advances 
we are not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that will have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity  capital or operations nor are we aware of any current recommendation by regulatory authorities  which  if implemented  would have a material effect on liquidity  capital or operations 
the total amount of our commitments to extend credit for mortgage and consumer loans as of december  was million  excluding commitments on unused lines of credit  which totaled million 
we intend to grow the bank s branch network either through opening or acquiring branch offices 
three new branch offices and the relocation of one branch are planned for in addition  we currently plan to open three additional new branch locations in the subsequent year 
we also intend to actively consider the acquisition of local financial institutions as a means to expand our banking operations 
we do not  however  have any current understandings  agreements or arrangements for the expansion of our business other than opening new branch office locations 
the following table discloses our contractual obligations as of december less than after total year years years years fhlb advances      rentals under operating leases    total      at december   our borrowing limit with the fhlb was million  excluding repurchase agreement advances  consisting of an overnight line of credit of million  an adjustable rate line of credit of million and a regular advance limit of million

impact of inflation and changes prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations  primarily those at the bank 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are financial 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the bank s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk qualitative analysis 
because the majority of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  a significant form of market risk for the bank is interest rate risk  or changes in interest rates 
we are vulnerable to an increase in interest rates to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or re price more rapidly than interest earning assets 
our assets include long term  fixed rate loans and investments  while our primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowings with substantially shorter maturities 
although having interest bearing liabilities that re price more frequently than interest earning assets is generally beneficial to net interest income during a period of declining interest rates  this type of asset liability mismatch is generally detrimental during periods of rising interest rates 
the board of directors has established an asset and liability management and budget committee that consists of directors scott chairman  de perez  fiore  kasper and putvinski 
the committee meets quarterly with management to review current investments average lives  durations and re pricing frequencies of loans and securities  loan and deposit pricing and production volumes and alternative funding sources  interest rate risk analysis  liquidity and borrowing needs  and a variety of other assets and liability management topics 
the management session of the committee is held monthly with president fiore presiding and senior management in attendance 
the results of the quarterly and monthly meetings of the committee are reported to the full board at its regular meetings 
in addition  the committee generally meets during october and november each year with the goal of developing an annual business and operating plan for presentation to the full board 
to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income  the bank has adopted various strategies to enable it to improve the matching of interest earning asset maturities to interest bearing liability maturities 
the main elements of these strategies include seeking to o originate loans with adjustable rate features or fixed rate loans with short maturities  such as home equity and consumer loans  o lengthen the maturities of time deposits and borrowings when it would be cost effective through the aggressive pricing and promotion of certificates of deposits and utilization of fhlb advances  o increase core deposits ie  checking and savings accounts which tend to be less interest rate sensitive  and o purchase intermediate and adjustable rate investment securities that provide a stable cash flow  thereby providing investable funds in varying interest rate cycles 
quantitative analysis 
management actively monitors its interest rate risk exposure 
the bank s objective is to maintain a consistent level of profitability within acceptable risk tolerances across a broad range of potential interest rate environments 
the bank uses the ots net portfolio value npv model to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk  which calculates changes in net portfolio value 
reports generated from assumptions provided and modified by management are reviewed by the asset and liability management committee and reported to the board of directors quarterly 
the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value report shows the degree to which balance sheet line items and the net portfolio value are potentially affected by a to basis point th of a percentage point upward and downward shift shock in the treasury yield curve 
the following table presents the bank s interest rate risk exposure as measured by the ots npv model as of december  the net portfolio value is calculated by the ots  based on information provided by synergy bank 
at december   the bank was in compliance with the interest rate risk limits established by the board of directors  with the exception of a ten basis points  or  variance in npv levels in a plus basis points rate shock scenario 
npv as of net portfolio value npv present value of assets basis changes in rates amount change change npv ratio point change dollars in thousands basis points   basis points basis points   basis points basis points   basis points basis points  basis points   basis points the basis points and basis points scenarios are not shown due to the prevailing low interest rate environment 
future interest rates  or their effect on npv or net interest income  are not predictable 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  prepayments and deposit run offs  and should not be relied on as indicative of actual results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in this type of computation 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of re pricing  they may react at different times and in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawals could deviate significantly from those assumed in making calculations set forth above 
additionally  an increased credit risk may result as the ability of many borrowers to service their debts may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase
