actual events  transactions and results may materially differ from the anticipated events  transactions or results described in such statements 
our ability to consummate such transactions and achieve such events or results is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the existence of demand for and acceptance of our products and services  regulatory approvals and developments  economic conditions  the impact of competition and pricing  results of financing efforts and other factors affecting our business that are beyond our control 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  we can give no assurance that our expectations will materialize 
many factors including those contained in business investment considerations could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements 
we are under no obligation to and do not intend to update  revise or otherwise publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of any unanticipated events 
general we specialize in the development and commercialization of autologous cellular technology that has specific applications in cosmetic dermatology and are exploring applications for periodontal disease  reconstructive dentistry and other health related markets 
our ability to operate profitably under our current business plan is largely contingent upon our success in obtaining regulatory approval to sell our products and upon our successful development of markets for our products and profitable manufacturing processes 
we may be required to obtain additional capital in the future to support these efforts or expand our operations 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain such regulatory approvals  successfully develop the markets for our products or profitable manufacturing methods  or obtain such additional capital as we might need  either through equity or debt financing  on satisfactory terms or at all 
additionally  no assurance can be given that any such financing  if obtained  will be adequate to meet our ultimate capital needs and to support our growth 
if adequate capital cannot be obtained on satisfactory terms  our operations could be negatively impacted 
if we achieve growth in our operations in the next few years  such growth could place a strain on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our ability to manage operations and growth requires the continued improvement of operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
in addition  we may find it necessary to hire additional management  financial and sales and marketing personnel to manage our expanding operations 
if we are unable to manage this growth effectively and successfully  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
although the focus of our efforts has been and will continue to be the development  testing and approval of the aesthetic and dental applications of our process  and research into other applications of our process  as a result of which our company is still considered to be a development stage enterprise  we have  since  made isolagen process injections available to physicians in the united kingdom and australia as a means of developing our marketing  sales and manufacturing processes 
revenues from the sale of these treatments were approximately million for fiscal these revenues partially offset the costs we are incurring in our developing marketing  sales and manufacturing 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
as of february   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
we believe our existing capital resources are adequate to finance our operations until june   however our long term viability is dependent upon successful operation of our business  our ability to automate our manufacturing process  the approval of our products and the ability to raise additional debt and equity to meet our business objectives 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of the our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside the control of management 
as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical operations  our future business plans and projected financial results  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the following discusses our significant accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue over the period the service is performed in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
in general  sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
currently the isolagen process is administered by an attending physician to each patient using our recommended regimen of up to three injections 
due to the short shelf life  each injection is cultured on an as needed bases and shipped prior to the individual injection being administered by the physician 
we believe each injection has stand alone value to the patient 
we invoice the attending physician upon that physician submitting his or her patient s tissue sample to us  as a result of which the contractual arrangement is between us and the medical professional 
the amount invoiced varies directly with the number of injections requested 
generally  orders are paid in advance by the physician prior to the first injection and are not refundable and there is no performance provision under any arrangement with any doctor  and there is no right to refund  or returns for unused injections 
as a result  we believe that the requirements of sab are met as each injection is shipped  as the risk of loss transfers to the customer at that time  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
advance payments are deferred until shipment 
the amount of the revenue deferred represents the fair value of the remaining undelivered injections measured in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services 
should the physician discontinue the regimen prematurely all remaining deferred revenue is recognized 
revenue from licenses and other upfront fees are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the respective agreement 
we also offer a service whereby we store a patient s cells for later use in the preparation of injections  and a service whereby we process a patient s cells to expand the cells to the mass necessary to prepare an injection  but then store the expanded cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
in accordance with eitf  the fees charged for both of these services are recognized as revenue rateably over the length of the storage agreement 
no separate revenue is recognized for the initial cell expansion service  as we do not offer this service separately and the process of cell expansion has no value without either the subsequent preparation of an injection or the storage of the expanded cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
this service did not result in significant revenue in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal we changed the manner by which we classify the costs incurred in our london and australia facilities as either costs of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses or research and development expenses 
we believe that the new classifications better reflect the primary purpose and functions of each of these facilities  as described below 
the new manner of classifying these costs is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented  as well as in the unaudited summarized quarterly financial data presented in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the reclassifications did not have any effect on net loss or net loss per share 
as described under business overview  the primary purpose of our houston  texas facility is to conduct research on the development  testing and approval of the aesthetic and dental applications of our process  including the required clinical trials  and research into other applications of our process  while our london and australia being closed in the first quarter of fiscal facilities were engaged in the commercialization of our process for which they earned revenues from the sale of isolagen process injections in these markets as a means of improving manufacturing technologies that are more automated and therefore can be used to produce commercial quantities of injections on a profitable basis 
therefore  we have classified as cost of sales the costs except for costs related to marketing  sales and general corporate administration incurred in operating our london and australia facilities as cost of sales  while the costs incurred in operating our houston  texas facility except for costs related to general corporate administration have been classified as research and development expenses 
previously some of the costs of operating our london and australia facilities now included in cost of sales had been included in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
costs of sales includes salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and a portion of facilities cost 
those costs  except for the costs of raw materials that have not been used  are expensed as incurred 
as discussed under business our solution  historically  autologous cell companies have been hampered by manufacturing technologies that use traditional methodology for culturing cells through the utilization of plastic flasks 
this methodology is labor intensive  slow  involves many sterile interventions and is costly 
the use of this process to produce isolagen process injections in commercial quantities would not  over time  be profitable 
we have been using the commercialization of our process in these markets as a means of researching and developing manufacturing technologies that are more automated and therefore can be used to produce commercial quantities of injections on a profitable basis 
through the end of fiscal our cost of sales has exceeded our revenues 
this reflects the fact that the level of our sales from our commercialization efforts in the united kingdom and australia  while increasing  have not yet reached the levels necessary for profitable operations  and the development and implementation of our automated processes has not yet achieved all of the cost efficiencies we hope to achieve 
if  in the future  the purposes for which we operate our houston  texas  or london facilities  or any new facilities we open  changes  the allocation of the costs incurred in operating that facility between cost of sales and research and development expenses could change to reflect such operational changes 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and a portion of facilities cost 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
intangible assets our intangible assets represent patent applications which are recorded at cost 
we have filed applications for patents in connection with technologies being developed 
the patent applications and any patents issued as a result of these applications are important to the protection of our technologies that may result from our research and development efforts 
costs associated with patent applications and maintaining patents are capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the patents 
we review the value recorded for intangibles to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows 
impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
the projection of future cash flows requires us to make estimates about the when product approvals may be obtained  and the amount of future revenues 
the actual future results could differ significantly from these estimates  and resulting changes in the estimates of future cash flows could be significant and could affect the recoverability of intangible assets 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under sfas no 
 we are permitted to either record expenses for stock options and other employee compensation plans based on their fair value at the date of grant or to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
 and recognize compensation expense  if any  based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument at the measurement date 
we have elected to continue following the provisions of apb no 
stock options issued to other than employees or directors are recorded on the basis of their fair value as required by sfas no 
beginning in the quarter beginning july   we will be required to adopt sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which eliminates the use of apb opinion no 
and we will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the reward the requisite service period 
no compensation cost will be recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
sfas no 
revised must be applied to all options granted or modified after its effective date and also to recognize the cost associated with the portion of any option awards made before its effective date for with the associated service has not been rendered as of its effective date 
we are still studying the requirements of sfas no 
revised and have not yet determined what impact it will have on our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ending december  and revenues 
revenues increased or  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to the continuation of operations in the united kingdom 
the isolagen process involves a patient s physician obtaining an approximately three millimeter punch skin sample from the patient 
the skin sample is packed in a container provided by us and shipped overnight to our laboratory 
we invoice the physician upon receipt of the skin sample 
the specimen is then cultured utilizing our isolagen process 
approximately six weeks later  the patient s cells are sent to the doctor for treatment 
additional amounts are available for re injection every two to three weeks 
we recognize one third of the revenue associated with each treatment upon the shipment of the first injection to the patient s physician  an additional one third of revenue associated with each treatment is recognized upon shipment of the second injection to the patient s physician  and the remaining one third is recognized upon the shipment of the last injection to the patient s physician 
the revenues which we did recognize during fiscal and fiscal from our united kingdom operations were in part reduced by the effects of promotional incentives provided to doctors utilizing the isolagen process 
we expect to continue providing such promotional incentives to doctors during the introduction phase of the isolagen process in the united kingdom 
we also offers a service whereby we store a patient s cells for later use in the preparation of injections  and a service whereby we processes a patient s cells to expand the cells to the mass necessary to prepare an injection  but then store the expanded cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
the fees charged for both of these services are recognized as revenue rateably over the length of the storage agreement 
revenues from these services were approximately  in fiscal and in fiscal cost of sales 
costs of sales increased  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal the increase in cost of sales is primarily related to the increase in activities of our london and australia facilities 
the increase resulted from increases in essentially all categories of costs as these facilities increased their commercialization of our process 
cost of sales exceeded revenues as the development and implementation of our automated processes has not yet achieved all of the cost efficiencies we hope to achieve 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the major components of the approximate million increase in selling  general and administrative expense are as follows a consulting expense increased by approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase included million of stock based expenses related to options and warrants issued under consulting and distribution agreements  and million of stock compensation related to stock options issued to directors and officers 
there was an million stock based expense for fiscal the level of the expense recorded for the warrants issued under consulting and distribution contracts can vary from quarter to quarter based on changes in the market price of our common stock 
b salaries increased by approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due to an increase in our number of employees 
the expense for fiscal included million related to employee severances 
of this million  million results from the severance of two employees who are entitled  under their contracts  to receive salary payments through july and million results from our decision to close our facility in australia and serve the australian market through our existing facility in europe see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal expense included an imputed expense of  for the fair market value of services provided by certain officers for which they will not be compensated 
c travel expense increased by approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal d legal expense increased by approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal e promotional expense increased by approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due to increased marketing and promotional efforts related to the expansion of our operations in the united kingdom

g office and other costs increased by approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  which increase is primarily related to the commencement of our operations in the united kingdom and the completion of our us laboratory 
there was an million loss on disposal of an asset  primarily consisting of assets in australia for fiscal there was an million loss on disposal of an asset  primarily consisting of the write off of software for fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million during fiscal to  from  for fiscal research and development costs are composed primarily of costs related to our efforts to gain fda approval for our products in the united states 
these costs include those personnel and laboratory costs related to the current fda trials and certain consulting costs 
this project is still under development 
the total cumulative cost of research and development incurred through december  is million 
as of december   we believe a minimum of million of additional expenditures will be required to complete this project 
that estimate assumes that no further testing requirements for the initial dermal applications are imposed by the fda  that we file our bla during the second half of the fda approval process is extremely complicated and is dependent upon our study protocols and the results of our studies 
in the event that the fda requires additional studies for dermal applications or requires changes in our study protocols or in the event that the results of the studies are not consistent with our expectations the process will be more expensive and time consuming 
due to the vagaries of the fda approval process we are unable to predict what the cost of obtaining approval for the initial dermal applications will be if the bla is not filed during the second half of we have other research projects currently underway 
however  research and development costs related to these projects were not material during the or periods 
the major components of the approximately million increase in research and development expense are as follows a consulting expense increased by approximately million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  b salaries and payroll taxes increased by approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  and c laboratory expense decreased by approximately million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal interest income 
interest income increased  or  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal the increase in interest income resulted principally from an increase in the amount of cash held in interest bearing accounts  and our investment in marketable debt securities  as the result of our receipt of the proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in the second quarter of fiscal and the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest expense

net loss for fiscal was  as compared to a net loss of  for fiscal this increase in net loss is attributed primarily to the increases in our selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses discussed above 
we compute our net loss per share on the basis of net loss attributable to common stockholders  which included the effects of certain items not included in the determination of net income 
net loss attributable to common stockholders for fiscal was  as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  for fiscal these amounts include million of deemed dividend associated with beneficial conversion of preferred stock for fiscal these amounts include million of preferred stock dividends for fiscal contractual obligations the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations  excluding interest  capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations     purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap  total     off balance sheet transactions we do not engage in material off balance sheet transactions

interest income decreased  or  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal the decrease in interest income resulted from  among other things  a decrease in our average cash balances in fiscal  and a decrease in interest rates paid on our deposits 
net loss 
net loss for fiscal was  as compared to a net loss of  for fiscal this increase in net loss is attributed primarily to salaries  travel  consulting  legal and promotional expenses 
net loss attributable to common stockholders for fiscal was  as compared to a net loss of  for fiscal these amounts include million and million of deemed dividend associated with beneficial conversion of preferred stock for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these amounts include million and million of preferred stock dividends for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
cash used in operating activities during fiscal amounted to  as compared to the  of cash used in operating activities during fiscal the increase is attributed primarily to salaries  travel  consulting  legal  and promotional expenses 
the negative operating cash flows in fiscal were financed from our cash balances as of december  and the proceeds of debt and equity placements  as discussed below 
investing activities 
cash used by investing activities during fiscal amounted to  as compared to cash used by investing activities of  during fiscal this increase in cash used is due to the purchase of property and equipment for the houston  texas  london  england  and sydney  australia laboratories of  in fiscal and the net purchase of short term investments of  in fiscal financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was  during fiscal  which consisted substantially of a the proceeds from the sale of  shares of common stock in a public offering in june for cash totaling  after deducting the costs and expenses associated with the sale and b the proceeds from the sale of million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due november   netting  after deducting the costs and expenses associated with the sale and the  share purchase of treasury stock 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal amounted to  consisting primarily of a  raised from the issuance of preferred stock  b  raised from the issuance of common stock  and c  in cash dividends paid on preferred stock 
in may  we sold in a private offering  shares of series b convertible preferred stock at an offering price of per share 
each share of series b preferred stock was convertible into shares of our common stock at any time after issuance and accrued dividends at per annum payable in cash or additional shares of series b preferred stock 
after deducting the costs and expenses associated with the sale  we received cash totaling  in conjunction with the private offering  we issued to the placement agent warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable immediately after grant and expire five years thereafter 
the fair value of the warrants granted to the placement agent  based on the black scholes valuation model is estimated to be per warrant 
the value of the warrants granted was offset from the proceeds received from the sale of the series b preferred stock and recorded as additional paid in capital 
as stated above  the price of the series b preferred stock sold was per share 
the market value of our common stock sold on the dates that the preferred stock was sold had a range of per common share 
in accordance with eitf this created a beneficial conversion to the holders of the preferred stock and a deemed dividend to the preferred stockholders totaling  was recorded with a corresponding amount recorded as additional paid in capital 
the deemed dividend associated with the beneficial conversion was calculated as the difference between the fair value of the underlying common stock less the proceeds that were received for the series b preferred stock limited to the value of the proceeds received 
in august  the company sold in a private offering  shares of common stock  par value per share  at an offering price of per share 
after deducting the costs and expenses associated with the sale  the company received cash totaling  in november  we issued million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due november  the convertible subordinated notes are convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at an initial conversion rate subject to adjustment of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  at any time prior to the stated maturity 
in the event of certain fundamental changes that occur prior to november   we are required to pay a make whole premium to the holders of the convertible subordinated notes that convert their convertible subordinated notes into our common stock on or after the date on which notice of such fundamental change is given 
the net proceeds from the convertible subordinated notes were approximately million 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to repurchase  shares of common stock  and intend to use the remainder for general corporate purposes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
working capital 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
as of february   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
we believe our existing capital resources are adequate to finance our operations until june   however our long term viability is dependent upon successful operation of our business  our ability to automate our manufacturing process  the approval of our products and the ability to raise additional debt and equity to meet our business objectives 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
retains the general principle of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  that inventories are presumed to be stated at cost  however  it amends arb no 
to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facilities  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period expenses 
also  sfas no 
requires fixed overhead costs be allocated to inventories based on normal production capacity 
the guidance of sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we believe that implementing sfas no 
should not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which eliminates the use of apb opinion no 
and will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the reward the requisite service period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
sfas no 
revised is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the quarter beginning july  for us and must be applied to all options granted or modified after its effective date and also to recognize the cost associated with the portion of any option awards made before its effective date for with the associated service has not been rendered as of its effective date 
we are still studying the requirements of sfas no 
revised and have not yet determined what impact it will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
apb opinion no 
provided an exception to the basic measurement principle fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets 
that exception required that some nonmonetary exchanges  although commercially substantive  be recorded on a carryover basis 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance  which are defined as transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect that sfas no 
will have a material affect on our financial statements 
other inflation 
inflation did not have a significant impact on our results during fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the form of foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
substantially all of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from operations in the united kingdom 
we commenced operations in australia in the fourth quarter of the results of operations and financial position of our foreign operations were principally measured in their respective functional currencies and translated into us dollars 
the effect of us dollar currency fluctuations against the foreign currency in these countries is somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currencies in which the revenue is generated 
our income will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
additionally  approximately of our assets at december  were based in our foreign operations and translated into us dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect as of the end of each accounting period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of consolidated stockholders equity 
accordingly  our consolidated stockholders equity will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
at december  we had approximately million invested in short term investment  comprised of marketable debt securities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these investments subject us to interest rate risk  in that increases in interest rates would cause the market value of the investments to decline and decreases in interest rates would cause the market value of the investments to increase 
additionally  approximately million of such investments are in the form of auction rate securities ars  for which the interest rate is reset periodically through a dutch auction process 
as a result  the interest rate we earn on those investments in future periods could decline if market interest rates decline  and could increase if market interest rates increase 
however  it should be noted that these investments represent the temporary investment of the proceeds of our fiscal equity and debt placements until these funds are needed for operating purposes 
accordingly  it is not anticipated that the december  level of investments will be held throughout fiscal and beyond  and as a result our exposure to interest rate risk must be judged accordingly 
our principle interest bearing debt  our convertible subordinated notes  pay interest at a fixed rate  and accordingly we are not exposed to interest rate risk as a result of this debt 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
