item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the m f worldwide consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the company is the world s largest producer of licorice products 
the company produces a variety of licorice products from licorice root  intermediar y licorice extracts produced by others and certain other ingredients at its facilities in the united states  france and the people s republic of china 
approximately of the company s licorice sales are to the worldwide tobacco industry for use as tobacco flavor enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of american blend cigarettes  moist snuff  chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco 
while licorice represents a small percentage of the total cost of manufacturing american blend cigarettes and other tobacco products  the particular formulation and quality used by each brand is an important element i n the brand s quality 
in addition  the company manufactures and sells cocoa and carob products for use in the tobacco industry 
over the last several years  th e rate of consumption of tobacco products has declined in the united states 
although the company has experienced recent sales declines to the domestic tobacco industry  the company s increased sales to the international tobacco industry have been aided by stable to slightly growing consumption of tobacco products outside of the united states along with a shift of production to facilities overseas by several large customers 
the company also sells licorice worldwide to confectioners  food processors  cosmetic companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers for use as flavoring and masking agents  including its magnasweet brand flavor enhancer  which is used in various brands of chewing gum  lip balm  energy bars  non carbonated beverages  chewable vitamins  aspirin and other products 
although the company s licorice sales to its confectionary customers have experienced some decline in recent years  licorice sales to food  cosmetic and pharmaceutical customers  who use magnasweet as a flavoring or masking agent  have experienced some growth and added to the company s overall sales stability for its licorice products 
one important facet of the company s business strategy is to focus on growing its business through sales of licorice derived products for use in non tobacco related applications 
the company is devoting a substantial portion of its research and development efforts to magnasweet and its potential food and beverage applications as well as to finding additional uses for components of licorice extract in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products the company also sells licorice root residue as garden mulch under the nam e right dress 
other non licorice product sales have decreased due to our decisio n to discontinue selling these products 
the company considers revenue from international business to be that revenue which is generated outside the united states 
the reorganization on october   the company completed an internal reorganization the reorganization with certain of its subsidiaries to separate the assets and liabilities related to its licorice products business from the assets and liabilities not related to its licorice products business 
prior to the reorganization  pneumo abex corporation held all the assets and liabilities associated with the licorice products business  as well as other assets and liabilities unrelated to the licorice products business 
in connection with the reorganization  mafco worldwide was formed  and pneumo abex corporation transferred all of the assets and liabilities related to that licorice products business to mafco worldwide 
following the transfer of the licorice products business to mafco worldwide  pneumo abex corporation merged with pneumo abex llc  a newly formed  wholly owned limited liability company subsidiary of mafco worldwide 
mafco worldwide then transferred all of the membership interests in pneumo abex llc to another subsidiary of the company  which resulted in pneumo abex llc no longer being a subsidiary of mafco worldwide 
the reorganization had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the bases of management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operation are the company s consolidated financial statements  which it prepares in accordance with accounting principle s generally accepted in the united states 
the company reviews its accounting policies on a regular basis 
the company makes estimates and judgments as part of its financial reporting that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates du e to actual outcomes being different from the assumed outcomes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates 
inventory licorice raw materials have an infinite life as long as they are kept dry  therefore the company has not been required to establish an obsolescence reserve for licorice 
a reserve for the value of the products has not been necessary based on the company s lower of cost or market analysis 
the company also ensures that storage facilities where the raw materials are inventoried are properly safeguarded and maintained to preserve its characteristics 
income taxes the company estimates actual current tax liability together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as net operating losses and depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will recover deferred tax assets from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
the balance of the valuation allowance at december   was million 
to the extent it establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include and expense the allowance within th e tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  the company is required to calculate the amount of income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
on a regular basis  the amount of taxable income is reviewed by various federal  state and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  the company routinely provides reserves for items that it believes could be challenged by these taxing authorities 
in addition  the company routinely provides valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that it believes may not be realized  eg  capital losses 
long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of property  plant and equipment and investments in joint ventures whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of use of these assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  and o significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  it measures the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
goodwill and intangible assets upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in  the company discontinued amortization of goodwill resulting from business acquisitions 
a reassessment of the useful life of other intangible assets  consisting of product formulations  determined th e useful life of these formulations to be indefinite  therefore  the company also discontinued amortization of the formulations in the company performs impairment tests on goodwill and product formulations annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
the company has elected to test these assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of the company based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing the estimated fair value with the carrying value  which includes the goodwill 
if the estimated fair value i s less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the company s implied fair value of goodwill requires the company to allocate the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the company 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value 
the company measures impairment of the product formulations based on a projected discounted cash flow 
the company also reevaluates the useful life of the product formulations annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
contingencies and indemnification agreements the company records the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are contingencies  and the accounting for such events follows sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment by management 
the company uses internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers and tax specialists  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that the company has incurred a loss and the amount or range of the loss 
whe n evaluating the need for an accrual or a change in an existing accrual  the company considers whether it is reasonably probable to estimate an outcome for the contingency based on its experience  any experience of others facing similar contingencies of which the company is aware and the particulars of the circumstances creating the contingency 
the company has not recognized any liability in its financial statements for matters covered by indemnification agreements 
the company considers these obligations to be those of third party indemnitors and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their ability to satisfy their obligations 
based upon the indemnitors active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery related to those liabilities  the company believes that the likelihood of failing to obtain reimbursement of amounts covered by indemnification is remote 
see item business the tobacco industry and corporate indemnification matters  item legal proceedings  and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
pensions the company sponsors defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  which cover certain current and former employees of the company who meet eligibility requirements 
the company s actuarial consultants use several statistical and other factors that attempt to estimate future events to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases a s determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant difference with the amount of pension expense liability that the company recorded 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any or participate in any off balance sheet arrangements

other liquidity risks licorice raw material supply in addition to the liquidity risks noted above  the company may encounter liquidity risks arising from its supply of licorice root raw material 
the company tries to maintain a sufficient licorice root raw material inventory and open purchase contracts to meet normal production needs for three years 
at december   the company had on hand a supply of licorice root raw material approaching three years 
licorice root has an indefinite retention period as long as it is kept dry  and therefore has experienced little  if any  material spoilage 
although the company has been able to obtain licorice root raw materials without interruption since world war ii  since there has been periodic instability in the areas of the world where licorice root raw material s are obtained  the company may in the future experience a short supply of licorice root raw materials due to these or other instabilities 
if the company is unable to obtain licorice root raw materials  or is unable to obtain them in a cost effective manner  the company s business will be severely hampered and the company will experience severe liquidity difficulties 
customers in  the company s ten largest customers  eight of which are manufacturers of tobacco products  accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues and one customer  altria group inc accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues 
if altria group inc were to stop purchasing licorice from the company  it would have a significant adverse effect on the financial results of the company  which would also create severe liquidity problems for the company 
corporate indemnification matters prior to  a former subsidiary of pneumo abex manufactured certain asbestos containing friction products 
pneumo abex has been named  typically along with to as many as or more other companies  as a defendant in various personal injury lawsuits claiming damages relating to exposure to asbestos 
pursuant to indemnification agreements  the original indemnitor has ultimate responsibility for all the remaining asbestos related claims asserted against pneumo abex through august and for certain asbestos related claims asserted thereafter 
in connection with the sale by pneumo abex in december of its friction products division  the second indemnitor assumed responsibility for substantially all asbestos related claims asserted against pneumo abex afte r august and not indemnified by the original indemnitor 
federal mogul corporation purchased the second indemnitor in october in october  the second indemnitor filed a petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and stopped performing its indemnity obligations to the company 
performance of the second indemnitor s indemnity obligation is guaranteed by th e indemnity guarantor 
following the bankruptcy filing of the second indemnitor  the company confirmed that the indemnity guarantor would fulfill the second indemnitor s indemnity obligations to the extent that they are no longer being performed by the second indemnitor 
pneumo abex s former subsidiary maintained product liability insurance covering substantially all of the period during which asbestos containing products were manufactured 
the subsidiary commenced litigation in against a portion of these insurers in order to confirm the availability of this coverage 
as a result of settlements in that litigation  other coverage agreements with other carriers and payments by the original indemnitor  the second indemnitor and the indemnity guarantor pursuant to their indemnities  pneumo abex is receiving reimbursement each month for substantially all of its monthly expenditures for asbestos related claims 
as of december   the company incurred or expected to incur approximately  of unindemnified costs  as to which it either has received or expects to receive approximately  in insurance reimbursements 
management does not expect these unindemnified matters to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  but pneumo abex is unable to forecast either the number of future asbestos related claimants or the amount o f future defense and settlement costs associated with present or future asbestos related claims 
the transfer agreement further provides that mcg will indemnify pneumo abe x with respect to all environmental matters associated with pneumo abex s and its predecessor s operations to the extent not paid by third party indemnitors or insurers  other than the operations relating to pneumo abex s aerospace business  which pneumo abex sold to parker hannifin corporation in april accordingly  environmental liabilities arising after the transaction with the original indemnitor that relate to the company s former aerospace facilities are the responsibility of pneumo abex 
the original indemnitor is obligated to indemnify pneumo abex for costs  expenses and liabilities relating to environmental and natural resource matters to the extent attributable to the pre operation of the businesses acquired from the original indemnitor  subject to certain conditions and limitations principally relating to complianc e with notice  cooperation and other procedural requirements 
the original indemnitor is generally discharging its environmental indemnification liabilities in the ordinary course 
it is generally not possible to predict the ultimate total costs relating to any remediation that may be demanded at any environmental site due to  among other factors  uncertainty regarding the extent of prior pollution  the complexity of applicable environmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  uncertainty regarding future changes to such laws and regulations or their enforcement  the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies and methods  and the questionable and varying degrees of responsibility and or involvement by pneumo abex 
however  the aggregate cost of cleanup and related expenses with respect to matters for whic h pneumo abex  together with numerous other third parties  have been named potentially responsible parties should be substantially less than million 
on february   the company  through pneumo abex  entered into the reimbursement agreement 
the reimbursement agreement provides for letters of credit totaling million covering certain environmental issues relating to one site and not related to the current business of pneumo abex 
during  the environmental protection agency reduced the letter of credit requirements t o million 
the cost of the letters of credit is being funded by mcg and or the original indemnitor 
pneumo abex had million of letters of credit outstanding at both december  and  respectively  in connection wit h the reimbursement agreement 
the company has not recognized any liability in its financial statements for matters covered by indemnification agreements 
the company considers these obligations to be those of third party indemnitors and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their ability t o satisfy their obligations 
based upon the indemnitors active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  an d financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery set forth above  the company believes that th e likelihood of failing to obtain reimbursement of amounts covered by insurance and indemnification is remote 
the former aerospace business of the company formerly sold certain of its aerospace products to the us government or to private contractors for the u 
s government 
certain claims for allegedly defective pricing that the government made with respect to certain of these aerospace product sales were retained by pneumo abex in the aerospace sale 
during  pneumo abex resolved one of these matters at a cost of million 
in the remaining matter  pneumo abex contests the government s allegations and has been attempting to resolve the matter without litigation 
various legal proceedings  claims and investigations are pending against the company  including those relating to commercial transactions  product liability  safety and health matters and other matters 
most of these matters are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and maximum limits  and by third party indemnities 
the company believes that the outcome of these matters in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  which could affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
as of december  and  the company s net foreign currency marke t exposures of million and million  respectively  are primarily the euro 
most of the company s export sales and purchases of licorice raw material s are made in us dollars 
the company s french subsidiary sells in several foreign currencies as well as the us dollar and purchases raw materials principally in us dollars 
since the exposures are not material  the company does not generally hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in foreign currency exposure in the near future 
a appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase to the related net unrealized gain for december  and a negligible increase for december conversely  a depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million decrease to the related net unrealized gain for december  and a negligible decrease for december at december   the company had no outstanding debt  and therefore was not subject to changes in interest rates 
neither the company nor its subsidiaries had any interest rate swap agreements in effect at december  management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed
