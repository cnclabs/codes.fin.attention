item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a self managed real estate investment trust that owns and manages a portfolio of mortgage backed securities and agency debentures 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from the spread between the interest income on our investment securities and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of investment securities 
we are primarily engaged in the business of investing  on a leveraged basis  in mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage backed securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans collectively  mortgage backed securities 
we also invest in federal home loan bank fhlb  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  and federal national mortgage association fnma debentures 
the mortgage backed securities and agency debentures are collectively referred to herein as investment securities 
under our capital investment policy  at least of our total assets must be comprised of high quality mortgage backed securities and short term investments 
high quality securities means securities that are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the nationally recognized rating agencies  are unrated but are guaranteed by the united states government or an agency of the united states government  or are unrated but we determine them to be of comparable quality to rated high quality mortgage backed securities 
the remainder of our assets  comprising not more than of our total assets  may consist of other qualified reit real estate assets which are unrated or rated less than high quality  but which are at least investment grade rated bbb or better by standard poor s corporation s p or the equivalent by another nationally recognized rating agency or  if not rated  we determine them to be of comparable credit quality to an investment which is rated bbb or better 
we may acquire mortgage backed securities backed by single family residential mortgage loans as well as securities backed by loans on multi family  commercial or other real estate related properties 
to date  all of the mortgage backed securities that we have acquired have been backed by single family residential mortgage loans 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to the current federal tax regulations  one of the requirements of maintaining its status as a reit is that we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
the results of our operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations primarily depend on  among other things  the level of our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
our net interest income  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums  varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our mortgage backed securities portfolio increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
the cpr on our mortgage backed securities portfolio averaged and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks while maintaining our status as a reit 
the following table presents the cpr experienced on our mortgage backed securities portfolio  on an annualized basis  for the quarterly periods presented 
quarter ended cpr december  september  june  march  december  we believe that the cpr in future periods will depend  in part  on changes in and the level of market interest rates across the yield curve  with higher cprs expected during periods of declining interest rates and lower cprs expected during periods of rising interest rates 
we have extended contractual maturities on borrowings  such that our weighted average contractual maturity on our repurchase agreements was days at december   as compared to days at december  the table below provides quarterly information regarding our average balances  interest income  interest expense  yield on assets  cost of funds and net interest income for the quarterly periods presented

we continue to explore alternative business strategies  alternative investments and other strategic initiatives to complement our core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality investment securities 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiative will or will not be implemented in the future 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the amounts reported in our financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our policies most affected by management s judgments  estimates and assumptions 
these policies have not changed during market valuation of investment securities all assets classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  based on market prices 
although we generally intend to hold most of our investment securities until maturity  we may  from time to time  sell any of our investment securities as part our overall management of our portfolio 
accordingly  we are required to classify all of our investment securities as available for sale 
our policy is to obtain market values from at least three independent sources and record the market value of the securities based on the average of the three 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the investments with unrealized losses are not considered other than temporarily impaired since the company has the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time  to maturity if necessary  sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments 
unrealized losses on investment securities that are considered other than temporary  as measured by the amount of decline in fair value attributable to factors other than temporary  are recognized in income and the cost basis of the investment securities is adjusted 
there were no such adjustments for the years ended december   or if in the future  management determines an impairment to be other than temporary we may need to realize a loss that would have an impact on future income 
interest income interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the investment securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities using the interest method 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  street consensus prepayment speeds  and current market conditions 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
repurchase agreements we finance the acquisition of our investment securities through the use of repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at their contractual amounts  including accrued interest  as specified in the respective agreements 
accrued interest is recorded as a separate line item on the statements of financial condition 
income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit and intend to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  with respect thereto 
accordingly  the company will not be subjected to federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to shareholders and as long as certain asset  income and stock ownership tests are met 
the company and fidac have made a joint election to treat fidac as a taxable reit subsidiary 
as such  fidac will be taxable as a domestic c corporation and subject to federal and state and local income taxes based upon its taxable income 
results of operations net income summary for the year ended december   our net income was million or basic earnings per average share available for common shareholders  as compared to million or basic earnings per average share for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our net income was million  or basic earnings per average share available for common shareholders 
net income per average share increased by and total net income increased million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  we attribute the increase in total net income for the year ended december  over the year ended december  as being due to the increased asset base and the interest rate spread 
the increased asset base was the result of deploying additional capital of approximately million from december  to december  into our strategy 
also  the addition of million advisory fee income from fidac for seven months of the year aided the increased revenue of the combined companies 
the interest rate spread increased from to 
the total amortization for the year ended december  was million and for the year ended december  was million 
for the year ended december   gain on sale of mortgage backed securities was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  even with the substantial decline in gain on sale of mortgage backed securities  the increase in spread income resulted in an increase in earnings per share year over year 
net income per average share decreased by and total net income decreased million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  the reason for the decline in net income was due to the interest rate spread decreasing to in from for the prior year 
the primary reason for the decline in interest rate spread is the amortization of premium paid on the mortgage backed securities 
the total amortization for the year ended december  was million and for the year ended december  was million 
the trend of record prepayment levels began to decline in the fourth quarter of the year this was evidenced by the amortization for the fourth quarter of million  in comparison to the third quarter of of million dividends per share for the year ended december  were per share  or million in total dividends per share for the year ended december  were per share  or million in total 

dividends per share for the year ended december  were per share  or million in total 
our return on average equity was for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the table below presents the net income summary for the years ended december      and net income summary dollars in the thousands  except for per share data year ended year ended year ended year ended year ended december december  december  december  december interest income      interest expense      net interest income      investment advisory and service fees  gain on sale of mortgage backed securities      distribution fees  general and administrative expenses      income before income taxes      income taxes  net income      dividend on preferred stock  net income available to common shareholders      weighted average number of basic common shares outstanding      weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding      basic net income per share available to common shareholders diluted net income per share available to common shareholders average total assets      average equity      return on average total assets return on average equity interest income and average earning asset yield we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  our primary source of income is interest income 
a portion of our income was generated by gains on the sales of our mortgage backed securities of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our interest income was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the yield on average investment securities was   and for the same respective periods 
our average earning asset balance increased by billion for the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year 
the increase was the direct result of the increased asset base and the increase in the interest rate yields 
the weighted average coupon rate at december  was  as compared to at december  the prepayment speeds decreased to cpr for the year ended december   from cpr for the year ended december  the increase in coupon  in conjunction with lower prepayment speeds  resulted in an increase in yield of basis points for the year  when compared to the declining yield of for the year ended december   as compared to the yield of for the year ended december  were the direct result of increased amortization on our assets due to the rise in prepayments speeds to cpr for the year ended december   from cpr for the year ended december   especially in the third quarter of the homeowners prepayment option makes the average term  yield and performance of a mortgage backed security uncertain because of the uncertainty in timing the return of principal 
in general  prepayments decrease the total yield on a bond purchased at a premium  because over the life of the bond that premium has to be amortized 
the faster prepayments  the shorter the life of the security  which results in increased amortization 
the table below shows our average balance of cash equivalents and investment securities  the yields we earned on each type of earning assets  our yield on average earning assets and our interest income for the years ended december      and  and the four quarters in average earning asset yield ratios for the four quarters in are annualized  dollars in thousands yield on average average average constant investment investment prepayment interest securities securities rate income for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the quarter ended december    for the quarter ended september    for the quarter ended june    for the quarter ended march    the constant prepayment rate decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the total amortization for the year ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
for the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  amortization was million  million  million  and million  respectively 
the second quarter experienced the highest level of prepayments and the third and fourth quarters were materially unchanged  providing evidence that the trend of higher prepayments is continuing 
interest expense and the cost of funds we anticipate that our largest expense will be the cost of borrowed funds 
we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of million for the year ended december  we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of million for the year ended december  we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of million for the year ended december  our average cost of funds was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  and for the year december  the cost of funds rate increased by basis points and the average borrowed funds increased by billion for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  interest expense for the year increased by million  due to the substantial increase in the average repurchase balance and the increase in the cost of funds rate 
the increase in the average repurchase balance was the result of our implementing our leveraged strategy after the completion of the equity offerings in the first quarter  in addition to equity acquired through the equity shelf program  the direct purchase and dividend reinvestment plan  and options exercised 
the cost of funds rate decreased by basis points and the average borrowed funds increased by billion for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  declined million over the previous year  even with the increase in the average borrowed funds for the year 
since a substantial portion of our repurchase agreements are short term  changes in market rates are directly reflected in our interest expense 
our average cost of funds was above average one month libor and below average six month libor for the year ended december  our average cost of funds was above average one month libor and above average six month libor for the year ended december  the table below shows our average borrowed funds and average cost of funds as compared to average one month and average six month libor for the years ended december      and and the four quarters in average cost of funds ratios for the four quarters in have been annualized  dollars in thousands average average one month average cost cost of libor of funds funds relative to relative to relative to average average average average average average average borrowed interest cost of one month six month six month one month six month funds expense funds libor libor libor libor libor for the year ended december   for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the year ended december    for the quarter ended december    for the quarter ended september    for the quarter ended june    for the quarter ended march    net interest income our net interest income which equals interest income less interest expense  totaled million for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  our net interest income increased because of the increase in our assets that resulted from the common stock and preferred stock offerings during as well as the increase in our spread income 
our net interest spread  which equals the yield on our average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period  was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this basis point increase was a result of the increase of the weighted average coupon at december  of from at december   and the improvement in cpr discussed above 
the increase in yield was only partially offset by the basis point increase in the cost of funds 
our net interest income decreased million for the year ended december  over the prior year 
this was the direct result of the cpr  which increased from in in the prior year to in the table below shows our interest income by earning asset type  average earning assets by type  total interest income  interest expense  average repurchase agreements  average cost of funds  and net interest income for the years ended december      and and the four quarters in net interest income ratios for the four quarters in have been annualized  dollars in thousands average average net investment total yield average balance of average net interest securities interest interest repurchase interest cost of interest rate held income earning assets agreements expense funds income spread for the year ended december       for the year ended december       for the year ended december       for the year ended december       for the year ended december       for the quarter ended december       for the quarter ended september       for the quarter ended june       for the quarter ended march       investment advisory and service fees fidac is a registered investment advisor that generally receives annual net investment advisory fees of approximately to basis points of the gross assets it manages  assists in managing or supervises 
at december   fidac had under management approximately billion in net assets and billion in gross assets  compared to billion in net assets and billion in gross assets at december  investment advisory and service fees for the year ended december  totaled million  net of fees paid to third parties pursuant to distribution service agreements for facilitating and promoting distribution of shares of fidac s clients 
fidac s net advisory fees were included in the consolidated statements post the merger dated june  gains and losses on sales of mortgage backed securities for the year ended december   we sold mortgage backed securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of million for an aggregate gain of million 
for the year ended december   we sold mortgage backed securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of billion for an aggregate gain of million 
for the year ended december   we sold mortgage backed securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of billion for an aggregate gain of million the gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  declined by million 
during the year ended december  the amount of sale was higher than historically  with a bulk of the liquidations in the second quarter 
due to declining rates  fixed rate securities had significantly appreciated and it was determined by the company s management to take advantage of the appreciation 
the gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  increased by million over the prior year 
the difference between the sale price and the historical amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities is a realized gain and increases income accordingly 
we do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis  but may from time to time sell existing assets to move into new assets  which our management believes might have higher risk adjusted returns  or to manage our balance sheet as part of our asset liability management strategy 
there have been insignificant losses from the sale of securities during the periods 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  g a expenses as a percentage of average total assets was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in g a expenses of million for the year december   was primarily the result of increased salaries  directors and officers insurance and additional costs related to the fidac merger

the increased asset base was the result of deploying additional capital of approximately million from december  to december  into our strategy 
to a lesser extent  the seven months of advisory fee income from fidac aided in the income growth 
even though total net income increased  the return on average equity remained unchanged at 
net income decreased by million in the year over the previous year  due to the declining interest rate spread in addition to spread income  we were able to take advantage of appreciation in asset value in   and the table below shows our net interest income  net investment advisory and service fees  gain on sale of mortgage backed securities  g a expenses  and income taxes each as a percentage of average equity  and the return on average equity for the years ended december      and  and for the four quarters in components of return on average equity ratios for the four quarters in have been annualized net investment advisory and gain on sale of net interest service mortgage backed g a income return on income average fees average securities expenses average taxes average average equity equity average equity equity equity equity for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended september  for the quarter ended june  for the quarter ended march  financial condition investment securities all of our mortgage backed securities at december    and were adjustable rate or fixed rate mortgage backed securities backed by single family mortgage loans 
all of the mortgage assets underlying these mortgage backed securities were secured with a first lien position on the underlying single family properties

we mark to market all of our earning assets to fair value 
all of our agency debentures are callable and carry an implied aaa rating 
we mark to market all of our agency debentures to fair value 
we accrete discount balances as an increase in interest income over the life of discount investment securities and we amortize premium balances as a decrease in interest income over the life of premium investment securities 
at december    and we had on our balance sheet a total of million  million and  respectively  of unamortized discount which is the difference between the remaining principal value and current historical amortized cost of our investment securities acquired at a price below principal value and a total of million  million and million respectively  of unamortized premium which is the difference between the remaining principal value and the current historical amortized cost of our investment securities acquired at a price above principal value 
we received mortgage principal repayments of billion for the year ended december   billion for the year ended december   and billion for the year ended december  the overall prepayment speed for the year ended december    and was   and respectively 
during the year ended december   the cpr declined to  from  due to a decline in refinancing activity 
during the year ended december   the annual prepayment speed was the highest in our history at 
the result was record returns of principal for the year  relative to the asset size 
given our current portfolio composition  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to increase over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would decrease during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would be required to amortize our net premium balance into income over a shorter time period 
similarly  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to decrease over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would increase during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would amortize our net premium balance over a longer time period

weighted average annual period cap none none none weighted average lifetime cap at december  investment principal value as percentage of investment securities at december  borrowings to date  our debt has consisted entirely of borrowings collateralized by a pledge of our investment securities 
these borrowings appear on our balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
at december   we had established uncommitted borrowing facilities in this market with lenders in amounts which we believe are in excess of our needs 
all of our investment securities are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings 
however  we limit our borrowings  and thus our potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days

at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
liquidity liquidity  which is our ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows us to purchase additional investment securities and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of our pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for us include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our investment securities varies 
our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should our needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  we believe that in most circumstances our investment securities could be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of our capital investment policy 
under this policy  we limit asset growth in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
borrowings under our repurchase agreements increased by million to billion at december   from billion at december  this increase in leverage was facilitated by the increase in our equity capital as a result of the issuance of common stock primarily through public offerings during we anticipate that  upon repayment of each borrowing under a repurchase agreement  we will use the collateral immediately for borrowing under a new repurchase agreement 
we have not at the present time entered into any commitment agreements under which the lender would be required to enter into new repurchase agreements during a specified period of time  nor do we presently plan to have liquidity facilities with commercial banks 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of the our mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements  prepayments on the mortgages securing such mortgage backed securities and to changes in the estimated fair value of such mortgage backed securities generally due to principal reduction of such mortgage backed securities from scheduled amortization and resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors 
through december   we did not have any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities and or market interest rates suddenly increase  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position

during the year ended december   options were exercised under the long term compensation plan at  also   common shares were sold through the dividend reinvestment and direct purchase program for million during the year ended december  the fidac acquisition was completed on june  we issued  common shares to the shareholders of fidac  based on the december  closing price of 
we continue to operate as a self managed and self advised real estate investment trust  with fidac operating as our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary 
fidac s shareholders may also receive additional shares of our common stock as an earn out in and worth up to  if fidac meets specific performance goals under the merger agreement 
we cannot calculate how many shares we will issue under the earn out provisions since that will vary depending upon whether and the extent to which fidac achieves specific performance goals 
even if fidac achieves specific performance goals for a fiscal year  the number of additional shares to be issued to the fidac shareholders will vary depending on our average share price for the first trading days of the following fiscal year 
with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our gaap or taxable income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
by accounting for our assets in this manner  we hope to provide useful information to stockholders and creditors and to preserve flexibility to sell assets in the future without having to change accounting methods 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful

the company s agency debentures are adjustable rate and fixed rate with a weighted average lifetime cap of at december  and at december  the reason for the decline in value of these securities is solely due to increases in interest rates 
all of the mortgage backed securities are aaa rated or carry an implied aaa rating 
these investments are not considered other than temporarily impaired since the company has the ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time  to maturity  if necessary  sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments

we generally expect to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of between and  although the ratio may vary from this range from time to time based upon various factors  including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity and over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings 
our target debt to equity ratio is determined under our capital investment policy 
should our actual debt to equity ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets  we will cease to acquire new assets 
our management will  at that time  present a plan to our board of directors to bring us back to our target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished over time by the monthly reduction of the balance of our mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates we continually review our asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
our goal is to provide attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining what we believe is a strong balance sheet 
we seek to manage the extent to which our net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  although we have not done so to date  we may seek to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in our portfolio of investment securities by entering into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps and interest rate swaps 
changes in interest rates may also affect the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
we will seek to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets we purchase at a premium with assets we purchase at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on our mortgage backed securities 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the expensing of unamortized premium  will reduce our net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters we calculate that our qualified reit assets  as defined in the internal revenue code  are of our total assets at december  and as compared to the internal revenue code requirement that at least of our total assets be qualified reit assets 
we also calculate that and  respectively  of our revenue qualifies for the source of income test  and of our revenue qualifies for the source of income test  under the reit rules for the years ended december  and we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income 
therefore  as of december     and we believe that we qualified as a reit under the internal revenue code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  we must maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying interests 
in addition  unless certain mortgage securitites represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the mortgage backed securities may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december     and we were in compliance with this requirement 
item a quantitative and qualitiative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our investment securities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on our operations 
if we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
to date  we have not purchased any hedging instruments 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value should interest rates go up or down by basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december   and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in projected percentage change in change in interest rate net interest income portfolio value basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature

these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly form the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this report 
these analyses contain certain forward looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor statement set forth under the heading  special note regarding forward looking statements
