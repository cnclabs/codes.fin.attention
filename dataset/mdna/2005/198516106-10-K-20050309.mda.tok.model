all references to years relate to the calendar year ended december of the particular year 
overview since our initial public offering in  our net sales have steadily increased from million in to  million in  which equates to a compound annual growth rate of for this period 
although we cannot predict future results with certainty  our long term goal is to capitalize on global market opportunities for each of our key product categories 
we are committed to our growth strategies of enhancing the retail productivity of our customers  leveraging our brands in international markets  further developing our product categories  selectively broadening our retail distribution channels and expanding the global awareness of our brands through license agreements 
with our well developed sourcing and distribution infrastructure and proven design and product development team  we believe that we are well positioned for future long term growth 
highlights for the year ended december  are as follows for the first time in company history  annual sales exceeded billion  increasing to  million compared to excluding changes in currency exchange rates  net sales increased 
as a percentage of net sales  our sales growth is largely attributable to our international businesses  particularly europe and our international distributor based markets 
however  in absolute dollar terms  nearly of our sales growth was the result of increased sales in the united states 
from a product category perspective  sales of sportswear and footwear represented over of sales growth for the year 
although our sales product mix continues to shift due to increased sales of sportswear and footwear  outerwear remains our largest product category representing million or of global net sales 
our backlog for the spring selling season as of september  increased million  or  to million from million as of september  excluding changes in currency exchange rates  spring backlog increased 
although we cannot predict with certainty any future results  our reported backlog is one indicator of our anticipated growth rates for the spring selling season 
many factors  however  could cause actual sales to differ materially from reported future order backlog 
moreover  the reported increase in our spring backlog is not indicative of  and should not be utilized in estimating growth for our fall selling season or any seasons beyond spring we will report our backlog for the fall selling season as of march  with our first quarter earnings release in april 
table of contents for the year  gross profit decreased basis points to in from in the decrease was primarily the result of a shift in sales product mix both between and within our product categories 
partially offsetting the unfavorable effects of the shift in sales product mix was the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as foreign currencies in our direct international markets strengthened in relation to the us dollar 
selling  general and administrative expenses were flat as a percentage of net sales at in both and in  we anticipate sg a expense will increase as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the operating costs associated with our new distribution center in kentucky as well as incremental personnel costs needed to support our growth strategies

net sales in the united states increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in net sales in the united states was the result of increased sales from sportswear  footwear and equipment partially offset by decreases in the outerwear and accessories categories 
increased shipments of sportswear in the united states were the most significant factor contributing to our consolidated sales growth for the year 
sportswear sales increased in all key product classes and within each major distribution channel 
footwear sales increased in all key product classes led by boots and sandals 
from a distribution channel perspective  footwear sales increased in all sales channels in the united states except the department store channel 
sales of outerwear decreased as a result of several factors  including the continued consumer trend toward purchasing lighter weight products generally selling at lower prices  unseasonable winter weather conditions during the fourth quarter of  and a challenging competitive environment 
the weakness in our youth outerwear category also affected outerwear sales during the year

net sales grew across all product categories  led by outerwear  followed by sportswear  accessories  equipment and footwear 
outerwear and sportswear sales growth was particularly strong in our international distributor based markets  while our business in korea contributed to the increase in sales of accessories 
footwear sales increased less in other international than in other geographic regions primarily due to the poor sell through of cold weather footwear in russia in as a result of mild weather conditions 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of the continued shift in our sales product mix both between and within product categories 
the unfavorable gross profit effect of shifts in our sales product mix was partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as foreign currencies in our direct markets appreciated against the us dollar 
a shift in our sales product mix from our traditional outerwear products to sportswear and footwear continued to have an unfavorable impact on our gross profit throughout this shift in sales product mix was anticipated due to our growth strategy to further develop and expand our product categories 
moreover  as a result of our growth strategies  increases in sales of sportswear and footwear outpaced sales growth from outerwear 
sales product mix affects our gross profits because our outerwear products generally carry higher gross profits than other product categories 
in  outerwear sales represented of net sales compared to of net sales 
sportswear and footwear sales represented and of net sales in  respectively  compared to and of net sales in  respectively 
in the future  we anticipate the shift in sales product mix will continue to exert pressure on our gross profits 
our gross profit also decreased due to shifts in sales product mix within our product categories 
shifts in sales product mix is a factor within each of our product categories especially the outerwear category where there has been a general consumer trend to purchase lighter weight  lower margin outerwear products and heavier sportswear products  such as fleece sweaters  vests and pullovers 
the unfavorable impacts on gross profit from product mix shifts were partially offset by the appreciation of many foreign currencies against the us dollar 
since our global supply of inventory is generally purchased with us dollars  our foreign businesses have benefited from the decreasing value of the us dollar 
this favorable gross profit impact has been most noticeable in our european  canadian and japanese businesses 
our gross profits may not be comparable to those of other companies in our industry because some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales 
some companies such as ours  however  have chosen to include these expenses as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a includes all costs associated with our design  marketing  distribution and corporate functions including depreciation and amortization 

table of contents sg a expense increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  sg a expense was flat at for each of and selling expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales due to a decrease in relative advertising expense 
the decrease was primarily attributable to incremental advertising and promotional spending during the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased personnel  travel and other operating expenses  including professional fees  which were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense 
the increase in personnel costs was partially attributable to increased headcount and contract labor to support increased unit sales volume and our new distribution center in kentucky 
increased headcount at our corporate and subsidiary offices to support the higher levels of sales also resulted in increased personnel spending 
the increase in travel expense was a function of increased headcount as well as increased international travel as our business matures outside the united states 
professional fees increased due to increased legal  audit and consulting fees  many of which were associated with requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
depreciation and amortization totaled million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily related to some assets in the united states becoming fully depreciated 
sg a expense is expected to increase as percentage of net sales in  compared to  primarily due to the operating costs associated with our new distribution center in kentucky as well as incremental personnel costs needed to support our growth strategies 
we expect that depreciation and amortization will increase to approximately million in as we place new distribution capital investments in service 
net licensing income as our licensees have continued to gain momentum in the market place with the sale of our branded products  our licensing arrangements have produced highly profitable income for the company 
we derive net licensing income from income that we earn through licensing our trademarks across a range of categories that complement our current product offerings 
for  we recognized licensing income from fourteen licensees 
products distributed by the licensees included socks  bags  packs  leather  eyewear  watches  camping gear  home furnishings and other accessories 
net licensing income increased million  or  to million in from million in licensing income in was led by columbia licensed socks  followed by bags  eyewear  leather accessories and camping gear 
interest income expense  net interest income was million in compared to million in the increase in interest income was due to the higher cash balance and higher interest rate environment compared to the same period in interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense was attributable to an increase in capitalized interest of million primarily related to the construction of the distribution center in kentucky and repayments of notes payable and long term debt 
income tax expense the provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in the reduction in the effective tax rate from to was due to several factors  including changes in the geographic mix of taxable income as some of our international subsidiary growth rates exceeded our united states growth rates coupled with reductions in our overall state income tax expense

net sales from outerwear increased million  or  to million in from million in sales of outerwear decelerated in the united states due to the relative maturity of the outerwear product category 
our outerwear business was more successful internationally where we experienced sales growth in europe  canada and in our other international geographic locations

in  outerwear sales represented of net sales compared to of net sales 
conversely  sportswear and footwear sales represented and of net sales in compared to and of net sales in  respectively 
in the future  we anticipate the shift in product sales mix will continue to exert pressure on our gross profits 
in  our improved gross profits were largely attributable to favorable sourcing costs 
although we continue to benefit from our sourcing efforts  in relative terms  sourcing costs did not materially impact our gross profits in the results of recording the mountain hardwear inventory at fair value in purchase accounting had an unfavorable impact on our gross profits of approximately percentage point 
most of the inventory that mountain hardwear had on hand as of the acquisition date  march   was sold during accordingly  the remaining mark to market adjustments will not have a material impact on our consolidated gross profit in the future 
our gross profits may not be comparable to those of other entities  because some entities include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales 
some companies such as ours  however  have chosen to include these expenses as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a increased million  or  to million in from million in excluding changes in currency exchange rates  sg a increased million  or 
the increase in sg a expense was primarily the result of an increase in variable selling expenses  including commissions and advertising expense  and operating expenses to support the higher level of sales 
the increase in advertising expense was primarily the result of our key growth initiatives to enhance channel productivity through the expansion of in store concept shops and brand enhancement systems 
during  we made significant investments installing these point of purchase displays at many of our retailers globally 
the increase in selling expenses was also partially attributable to a promotional agreement we entered into with jeep for the introduction of new limited production columbia edition jeep vehicles  to provide broad brand exposure for columbia in the united states and canada 
through the program  we received national media exposure expanding columbia brand awareness 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in personnel related costs and depreciation expense 
the increase in personnel costs was due to an expansion of our product offerings and to support the higher level of sales and anticipated sales growth 
depreciation and amortization totaled million for compared to million for the increase was primarily related to our european distribution center  which was placed in service in january as a percentage of net sales  sg a was in each of and net licensing income as our licensees have gained momentum in the market place with the sale of our branded products  our licensing arrangements have produced highly profitable income for the company 
although net licensing income is not a significant income driver as mentioned above  beginning in net licensing income was presented as a separate line item in our consolidated statement of operations for all years presented  whereas it historically had been presented as an offset to sg a expense 
net licensing income is derived from income that we earn through licensing our trademark across a range of categories that complement our current product offerings 
at december   we had signed thirteen 
table of contents licensing agreements for products that include socks  bags  packs  leather outerwear  eyewear  watches and other accessories 
net licensing income increased million  or  to million in from million in interest income expense  net interest income was million in compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in interest income was due to the lower interest rate environment and the relative mix of taxable and tax exempt investment securities compared to the same period in interest expense was million in compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in interest expense was attributable to the repayment of short term notes payable and long term debt 
income tax expense the provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in the reduction in the effective tax rate from to is primarily due to a reduction in accrued income taxes related to favorable outcomes of various federal  state and international income tax audits during the year 
liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing funding requirements are to finance working capital and the continued growth of the business 
we financed our operations for the year ended december  primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales in the latter part of  an increase in inventories primarily attributable to the higher speculative inventory position that we took for fall  an unplanned increase in net cancellations of us orders primarily due to unfavorable winter weather conditions  an increase in raw materials and work in process inventory in china for and our current outlook for spring growth 
the appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro and canadian dollar against the us dollar also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increase in net income partially offset the increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
our primary capital requirements are for working capital  investing activities associated with the expansion of our global operations and general corporate needs 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in in  our investing activities primarily consisted of million used for capital expenditures  including approximately related to the construction of our distribution center in kentucky 
in  our investing activities included million related to net purchases of short term investments  million for the acquisition of mountain hardwear  net of cash acquired  and million for capital expenditures including approximately million related to the initial phase of construction of our kentucky distribution center 
cash used in financing activities was million in and million in in  net cash used in financing activities was for the repurchase of common stock of million and the repayment of long term debt of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of stock under employee stock plans of million 
in  net cash used in financing activities was primarily for the net repayment of notes payable of million  the repayment of mountain hardwear s debt of million  and the repayment of long term debt of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of stock under employee stock plans of million 
to fund our domestic working capital requirements  we have available unsecured revolving lines of credit with aggregate seasonal limits ranging from million to million  of which million to million is committed 
at december   no domestic balance was outstanding under these lines of credit 
internationally  our subsidiaries have local currency operating lines in place guaranteed by us with a combined 
table of contents limit of approximately million at december  there were no balances outstanding under these lines of credit at december  additionally  we maintain unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit with a combined limit of million at december   available for issuing letters of credit 
at december   the balance outstanding under these letters of credit was million 
as we continue our investment in global infrastructure to support our growth  we anticipate that capital expenditures for will total approximately million  consisting of maintenance capital requirements and information technology and distribution projects 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures with existing cash and cash provided by operations 
if the need arises for additional expenditures  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional credit facilities will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
we do not assure you that financing will be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our operations are affected by seasonal trends typical in the outdoor apparel industry  and have historically resulted in higher sales and profits in the third calendar quarter 
this pattern has resulted primarily from the timing of shipments to wholesale customers for the fall outerwear season 
we believe that our liquidity requirements for at least the next months will be adequately covered by existing cash  cash provided by operations and existing short term borrowing arrangements 
the following table presents our estimated contractual commitments in thousands year ending december  thereafter total debt repayments other operating leases non related parties related party other amounts primarily include installment payments on purchase obligations made in the ordinary course of business for non product purchases 
the amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements 
these operating lease commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as a result of our international sales  production and funding requirements 
our policy is to use financial instruments to reduce market risk where internal netting and other strategies cannot be effectively employed 
foreign currency and interest rate transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect cash flows resulting from production purchases  intercompany transactions and other costs from exchange rate movements 
we manage this risk primarily by using forward exchange contracts and options to hedge various firm as well as anticipated commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
anticipated  but not yet firmly committed  transactions that we hedge carry a high level of certainty and are expected to be recognized within one year 
we use cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated 
table of contents payments related to intercompany loan agreements 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollars 
the fair value of our hedging contracts was unfavorable by million and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollar exchange rates would have resulted in the fair value fluctuating approximately million at december  and million at december  changes in fair value  resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  would be substantially offset by the change in value of the underlying hedged transactions 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we have no exposure due to interest rate changes on our million and million of long term debt at december  and  respectively 
we do  however  have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit because interest on those lines floats and is based on libor and other interest rate indices 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policy for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  the provision for potential excess  close out and slow moving inventory  product warranty and income taxes 
management and our independent auditors regularly discuss with our audit committee each of our critical accounting estimates and the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the disclosure about each estimate in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
revenue recognition we record wholesale and licensed product revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title generally passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some countries outside of the united states  predominantly where we sell directly in western europe  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based on historical and expected delivery times by geographic location 
we periodically test the accuracy of these estimates based on actual transactions 
delivery times vary by geographic location  generally from one to four days 
to date  we have found these estimates to be materially accurate 
upon shipment  we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues 
the estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and claims that have ranged 
table of contents from approximately one to two percent of sales 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves that had been established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such a determination 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates for the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we analyze specific customer accounts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance could be required 
if we determine a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to sg a expense in the period in which we made the determination 
inventory obsolescence and product warranty we make ongoing estimates of potential future excess  close out or slow moving inventory and product warranty costs 
we identify our excess inventory  a component of which is planned  and evaluate our purchase commitments  sales forecasts  and historical experience and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value 
when evaluating our reserve for warranty costs  we consider our historical returns rates by season  product mix  current economic trends  and the historical cost to repair  replace  or refund the original sale 
if we determine smaller or larger reserves were appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period we made the determination 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially affecting our financial position and results of operations 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated effective rate 
as the calendar year progresses  we periodically refine our estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual effective tax rate

is effective for the fiscal years beginning after june  management believes that the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
forward looking statements this annual report  including item of part i and items and a of part ii  contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include any statements related to our expectations regarding future performance or conditions  including any statements regarding anticipated sales growth across markets  distribution channels  and product categories  access to raw materials and factory capacity  and financing and working capital requirements and resources 
these forward looking statements  and others we make from time to time  are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements  including the risks described below under the 
table of contents heading factors that may affect our business and the price of our common stock 
we do not undertake any duty to update forward looking statements after the date they are made or to conform them to actual results or to changes in circumstances or expectations 
factors that may affect our business and the price of our common stock we may be adversely affected by weather conditions our business is adversely affected by unseasonal weather conditions 
sales of our outerwear and cold weather footwear are dependent in part on the weather and may decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products 
for example  in  unseasonably warm weather in the united states caused customers to delay  and in some cases reduce or cancel  orders for our outerwear  which had an adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter or unseasonably cold or wet weather in the spring could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by an economic downturn or economic uncertainty sales of our products are subject to substantial cyclical fluctuation 
consumer demand for our products may not reach our growth targets  or may decline  when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets  particularly markets in north america and europe 
weakness in the japanese economy  for example  has limited growth opportunities in recent years  and a slower economy in the united states in and created additional uncertainties for our customers and our business 
in addition  continued volatility in the global oil markets has resulted in rising fuel prices  which many shipping companies are passing on to their customers 
our shipping costs have continued to increase over the past several years  and we expect these increases to continue 
because we price our products to our customers in advance  we may not be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers 
our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand and rising shipping costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our international operations involve many risks we are subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad 
these risks include foreign governmental laws and regulations  foreign consumer preferences  political unrest  disruptions or delays in shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products 
in addition  disease outbreaks  terrorist acts and us military operations have increased the risks of doing business abroad 
these factors  among others  could affect our ability to sell products in international markets  our ability to manufacture products or procure materials  and our cost of doing business 
if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states or into our other sales markets 
the countries in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate  adjust or impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by the financial health of retailers we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer s financial circumstances  generally without requiring collateral 
to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products  we offer customers discounts for placing pre season orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before the peak shipping season 
these extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectible receivables 
in addition  we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty 
some of our significant customers 
table of contents have experienced financial difficulties in the past  which in turn have had an adverse effect on our business  and we believe that retailers are being more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy 
a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in very competitive markets the markets for outerwear  sportswear  rugged footwear  tents and sleeping bags are highly competitive  as are the markets for our licensed products 
in each of our geographic markets  we face significant competition from global and regional branded apparel and footwear companies 
in many instances  retailers who are our customers pose our most significant competitive threat by marketing apparel  footwear and equipment under their own labels 
we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 
many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources and have achieved greater recognition for their products than we have 
increased competition could result in reductions in display areas in retail locations  reductions in sales  or reductions in our profit margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks associated with consumer preferences and fashion trends changes in consumer preferences or consumer interest in outdoor activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  although we believe that our products have not been significantly affected by past fashion trends  changes in fashion trends could have a greater impact as we expand our offerings to include more product categories in more geographic areas 
we also face risks because our business requires us to anticipate consumer preferences 
our decisions about product designs often are made far in advance of consumer acceptance 
although we try to manage our inventory risk through early order commitments by retailers  we must generally place production orders with manufacturers before we have received all of a season s orders  and orders may be cancelled by retailers before shipment 
if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to consumer preferences  we could experience lower sales  excess inventories and lower profit margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on our use of proprietary rights our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products 
we also place significant value on our trade dress  the overall appearance and image of our products 
from time to time  we discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products  design knock offs  or otherwise infringe on our proprietary rights 
counterfeiting activities typically increase as brand recognition increases  especially in markets outside the united states 
if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party s products on the basis of trademark or design infringement  continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products 
the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
additionally  in markets outside of the united states  it may be more difficult for us to establish our proprietary rights and to successfully challenge use of those rights by other parties 
actions or decisions in the management of our intellectual property portfolio may affect the strength of the brand  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with trademark and trade dress disputes  as we extend our brand into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  we could become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties 
future litigation also may be necessary to defend us against such claims or to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
any intellectual property litigation 
table of contents could be costly and could divert management s attention from the operation of our business 
adverse determinations in any litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on our distribution facilities our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory  complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our existing distribution facilities  the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities 
in the united states  we rely primarily on our distribution centers in portland  oregon and robards  kentucky  in canada  we rely primarily on our distribution center in strathroy  ontario  and in europe we rely primarily on our distribution center in cambrai  france 
the implementation and performance of our kentucky distribution facility is subject to many risks generally associated with transition and startup activities  including the risk that the new distribution facility may not successfully handle distribution activities and the risk that the transition may be disruptive to our business 
our distribution facilities in the united states and france are highly automated  which means that their operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to computer viruses  the proper operation of software and hardware  electronic or power interruptions  or other system failures 
risks associated with upgrading or expanding these facilities may significantly disrupt our operations 
our distribution facilities could also be interrupted by disasters  such as earthquakes which are known to occur in the northwestern united states or fires 
we maintain business interruption insurance  but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effect that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 
our success depends on our information systems our business is increasingly reliant on information technology 
information systems are used in all stages of our production cycle  from design to distribution  and are used as a method of communication between employees  our subsidiaries overseas  as well as our customers 
we also rely on our information systems to allocate resources and forecast operating results 
system failures or service interruptions may occur as the result of a number of factors  including computer viruses  hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties  disasters  or failure to properly protect  repair or maintain systems 
any interruption of critical business information systems may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on our growth strategies we face many challenges in implementing our growth strategies 
for example  our expansion into international markets involves countries where we have little sales or distribution experience and where our brand is not yet widely known 
expanding our product categories involves  among other things  gaining experience with new products  gaining consumer acceptance  and establishing and protecting intellectual property rights 
increasing sales to department stores  and improving the sales productivity of our customers  will each depend on various factors  including strength of our brand name  competitive conditions  our ability to manage increased sales and future expansion  the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of terms with retailers 
future terms with customers may be less favorable to us than those under which we now operate 
large retailers in particular increasingly seek to transfer various costs of business to their vendors  such as the cost of lost profits from product price markdowns 

table of contents to implement our business strategy  we must manage growth effectively 
we need to continue to change various aspects of our business  to maintain and enhance our information systems and operations to respond to increased demand and to attract  retain and manage qualified personnel 
growth could place an increasing strain on management  financial  product design  marketing  distribution and other resources  and we could experience operating difficulties 
for example  in recent years  we have undertaken a number of new initiatives that require significant management attention and corporate resources  including the development or expansion of distribution facilities on two continents  the acquisition  rejuvenation and expansion of the sorel brand  and the acquisition  integration and expansion of mountain hardwear  inc this growth involves many risks and uncertainties that  if not managed effectively  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations we generally purchase products in us dollars 
however  the cost of these products sourced overseas may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies 
price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations could make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins 
our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies  and these revenues and expenses could be materially affected by currency fluctuations  including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 
foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by labor disruptions our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner 
labor disputes at factories  shipping ports  transportation carriers  or distribution centers create significant risks for our business  particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns  lockouts  strikes  or other disruptions during our peak manufacturing and importing seasons  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 
we depend on independent manufacturers our products are produced by independent manufacturers worldwide 
we do not operate or own any production facilities 
although we enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season  we do not have long term contracts with some manufacturers 
we therefore face risks that manufacturing operations will fail to perform as expected or that our competitors will gain production or quota capacities that we need for our business 
if a manufacturer fails to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our standards  we could miss delivery deadlines  which could result in cancellation of orders  refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
reliance on independent manufacturers also creates quality control risks 
a failure in our quality control program could result in diminished product quality  which may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in an effort to ensure that our independent manufacturers operate with safe  ethical and humane working conditions  we regularly monitor factories and we enforce our requirements that each manufacturer agree to comply with our standards of manufacturing practices and applicable laws and regulations  but we do not control these vendors or their labor practices 
if a manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or engages in practices that are not generally accepted as ethical in our key markets  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we depend on key suppliers some of the materials that we use may be available  in the short term  from only one source or a very limited number of sources 
for example  some specialty fabrics are manufactured to our specification by one source or a few sources 
from time to time  we have experienced difficulty satisfying our raw material and finished goods requirements 
although we believe that we could identify and qualify additional factories to produce these materials  the unavailability of some existing manufacturers for supply of these materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our advance purchases of products may result in excess inventories to minimize our purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery  we place orders for our products with manufacturers prior to receiving all of our customers orders and maintain an inventory of various products that we anticipate will be in greater demand 
we may not be able to sell the products we have ordered from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory 
customers are allowed to cancel an order prior to shipment with sufficient notice 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on key personnel our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel  particularly timothy boyle  our president and chief executive officer  and gertrude boyle  our chairman and widely recognized advertising spokesperson 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers  designers  sales people and others 
we face intense competition for these individuals worldwide  and there is a significant concentration of well funded apparel and footwear competitors in and around portland  oregon including nike and adidas salomon 
we may not be able to attract or retain these employees  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our business is affected by seasonality our results of operations have fluctuated and are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
our products are marketed on a seasonal basis  with a product sales mix now weighted substantially toward the fall season 
our results of operations for the quarter ended september in the past have been much stronger than the results for the other quarters 
this seasonality  along with other factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions  changes in consumer preferences  weather conditions  availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations  could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate 
our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control  including shifts in product sales mix  geographic sales trends  and currency exchange rate fluctuations  all of which we expect to continue as we expand our product offerings and geographic penetration 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
we face risks of product liability and warranty claims our products are used in outdoor activities  sometimes in severe conditions 
although we have not experienced any significant expense as the result of product recalls or product liability claims  recalls or these types of claims could occur in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business 
some of our products carry limited warranties for defects in quality and workmanship 
we maintain a warranty reserve for future warranty claims  but the actual costs of servicing future warranty claims could exceed the reserve and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our common stock price may be volatile the price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market  which has experienced and is likely to continue to experience 
table of contents significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
we also believe factors such as fluctuations in financial results  variances from financial market expectations  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or announcements by us or competitors may cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
insiders control a majority of our common stock and could sell shares three shareholders timothy boyle  gertrude boyle and sarah bany beneficially own a majority of our common stock 
as a result  if acting together  they can effectively control matters requiring shareholder approval without the cooperation of other shareholders 
shares held by these three insiders are available for resale  subject to the requirements of  and the rules under  the securities act of the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock
