page of off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business  the company enters into financial instruments  such as commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  to meet the financing needs of its customers 
such instruments are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contract amounts of these instruments reflect the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party on whose behalf the instrument has been issued 
the company undertakes the same credit evaluation in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments and may require collateral or other credit support for off balance sheet financial instruments 
at december  the company had million in unused loan commitments outstanding  of which approximately million were at variable rates and the remainder was at fixed rates 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as the conditions established in the agreement have been satisfied 
a commitment to extend credit generally has a fixed expiration date or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower 
since commitments often expire without being fully drawn  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the company 
the company continually evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
occasionally  a credit evaluation of a customer requesting a commitment to extend credit results in the company obtaining collateral to support the obligation 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing a letter of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending a loan 
at december  the company had million in letters of credit issued and outstanding
