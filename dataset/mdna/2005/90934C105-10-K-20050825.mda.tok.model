industry in an effort to control costs while assuring the delivery of quality health care services  the public and private sectors have increasingly turned to managed care solutions 
as a result  the managed care industry  which includes health maintenance organization hmo  preferred provider organization ppo and prepaid health service plans  has grown substantially 
while the trend toward managed care solutions has traditionally been pursued most aggressively by the private sector  the public sector has embraced the trend in an effort to control the costs of health care provided to medicaid recipients

fees paid to the company were changed  however  to a cost based fee  by amendment dated december  and effective august  managed plan owned by the company uahc tn 
uahc tn was organized as a tennessee corporation in october  and is headquartered in memphis  tennessee 
the company was active in the development of uahc tn  and through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  united american of tennessee  inc  wholly owns uahc tn 
uahc tn began as a ppo contractor with the bureau of tenncare  a state of tennessee program that provides medical benefits to medicaid and working uninsured and uninsurable recipients  and operated as a full risk prepaid health services plan until it obtained its tenncare hmo license in march uahc tn s tenncare hmo contract was executed in october  retroactive to the date of licensure 
in november  uahc tn contracted with the state of tennessee  doing business as tenncare tenncare  as a medicaid ppo to arrange for the financing and delivery of health care services on a capitated basis to eligible medicaid beneficiaries and the working uninsured and uninsurable non medicaid individuals who lack access to private or employer sponsored health insurance or to another government health plan 
tenncare placed an indefinite moratorium on working uninsured enrollment in december  however  such action did not affect persons enrolled in a plan prior to the moratorium 
in april  enrollment was expanded to include the children of the working uninsured up to age the contract between uahc tn and tenncare was renewed july  for a month term  expiring december  the new contract provided for increased capitation rates  but eliminated the practice of providing retroactive payments to managed care organizations for high cost chronic conditions of their members adverse selection and payments earmarked as adjustments for covered benefits 
uahc tn was assigned approximately  members by tenncare in the second half of fiscal as a result of three other managed care organizations  which had contracts with tenncare  ceasing to serve their enrollees or being unable to take on new enrollees 
medical services expenses for such new uahc tn members disproportionately exceeded uahc tn s normal per member per month pmpm experience and adversely affected its earnings for and since that period 
uahc tn received from tenncare in fiscal an adverse selection payment of million for such fiscal expenses 
in june  tenncare developed new risk sharing options for its participating managed care organizations mcos  including uahc tn 
uahc tn entered into its changed contract with tenncare effective july  at june   uahc tn was licensed in and served shelby and davidson counties in tennessee which include the cities of memphis and nashville  respectively 
effective july   uahc tn received approval from tenncare to expand its service area to western tennessee and to withdraw from davidson county 
additionally  a significant competitor of uahc tn ceased doing business in october  and tenncare assigned approximately  of that plan s members to uahc tn on february  beginning july   tenncare implemented an month stabilization program which entailed changes to tenncare s contracts with mcos  including uahc tn 
during that period  mcos were generally compensated for administrative services only commonly called aso  earned fixed administrative fees  were not at risk for medical costs in excess of targets established based on various factors  were subject to increased oversight  and could incur financial penalties for not achieving certain performance requirements 
through successive contractual amendments  tenncare extended the aso reimbursement system applicable to uahc tn  first through june   then through december   and then through june  uahc tn sought reimbursement from tenncare for exceptionally high medical expenses incurred by new uahc tn enrollees in fiscal year  including for actuarially estimated claims incurred but not yet reported to uahc tn 
in response  tenncare amended its contract with uahc tn in september  retroactive to july  in some respects and to may  in other respects 
the amendment stated that uahc tn s outside actuary certified the plan required million to meet its statutory net worth requirement for the year ended june  and that uahc tn is a viable hmo under contract with tenncare on the same basis as other comparable hmos in the program effective july  pursuant to such contractual amendment uahc tn retroactively elected an available risk option for the ten months from july  through april   tenncare retroactively agreed to reimburse uahc tn on a no risk aso basis for medical services effective beginning may   and tenncare agreed to pay uahc tn up to million as necessary to meet its statutory net worth requirement as of june  pursuant to an agreement between tenncare and uahc tn in october  tenncare further agreed to pay additional funds to uahc tn if future certified actuarial data confirmed they were needed by uahc tn to meet that requirement 
uahc tn received a permitted practice letter from the state of tennessee to include such million receivable in its statutory net worth at june  under generally accepted accounting principles  the million receivable and additional funds were not recorded in fiscal financial statements but have been recorded in subsequent fiscal years as fiscal claims are processed 
for the year ended june   an additional million of such medical claims were processed  and the same amount was recognized as revenue by uahc tn 
uahc tn s application for a commercial hmo license was approved on september  management is not yet actively pursuing that commercial business  however  due to uahc tn s substantially increased enrollment from members tenncare assigned to it from defunct other plans 
through an amendment with an effective date of july   tenncare has implemented a modified risk arrangement with all its contracted mcos  including uahc tn  which are at risk for losing up to of administrative fee revenue and may receive up to incentive bonus revenue based on performance relative to benchmarks 
tenncare has also announced plans to disenroll non medically needy adults who are not eligible for medicaid from tenncare coverage statewide  and to impose benefit limits on the  adults left in the program who are eligible for medicaid 
the announced plans would preserve full coverage for the  children on the program 
as a result  uahc tn expects to lose only approximately  of its present  members over a month period beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  being its only working uninsured and uninsurable adult members 
as of august   uahc tn s total enrollment was  members  of whom were medicaid enrollees and were non medicaid enrollees 
managed plan previously operated by the company omnicare mi 
as further described below  omnicare mi ceased to be a managed plan operated by the company effective november  while managed by the company  omnicare mi was a not for profit  tax exempt corporation headquartered in detroit  michigan and serving southeastern michigan  operating in wayne  oakland  macomb  monroe and washtenaw counties 
its history included a number of innovations that were adopted and proved successful for the industry 
while managed by the company  it was the first network model hmo in the country and the first to capitate physician services in an ipa model hmo an independent practice association model hmo does not employ physicians as staff  but instead contracts with associations or groups of independent physicians to provide services to hmo members 
omnicare mi also created and implemented the first known mental health capitation carve out in while managed by the company  omnicare mi s enrollment was through companies that offered the health plan coverage to employees and their family members  through individual enrollment and through the state of michigan s medicaid program pursuant to an agreement with the michigan department of community health  which made hmo coverage available to eligible medicaid beneficiaries in certain counties and mandatory in others 
as a michigan hmo  omnicare mi was subject to oversight by the state of michigan s commissioner of the office of financial and insurance services the commissioner 
on july   pursuant to a motion by the commissioner  a state circuit court judge entered an order of rehabilitation of omnicare mi the order and appointed the commissioner as rehabilitator of omnicare mi 
the order directed the rehabilitator to administer all of omnicare mi s assets and business while attempting to effectuate its rehabilitation  preserve its provider network and maintain uninterrupted health care services to the greatest extent possible 
the order required the company to continue performing all services under its omnicare mi management agreement  which the company did until that agreement s termination on november   pursuant to omnicare mi s court approved rehabilitation plan 
government regulation the company is and or has been subject to extensive federal and state health care and insurance regulations designed primarily to protect enrollees in the managed plans  particularly with respect to government sponsored enrollees 
such regulations govern many aspects of the company s business affairs and typically empower state agencies to review management agreements with health care plans for  among other things  reasonableness of charges 
among the other areas regulated by federal and state law are licensure requirements  premium rate increases  new product offerings  procedures for quality assurance  enrollment requirements  covered benefits  service area expansion  provider relationships and the financial condition of the managed plans  including cash reserve requirements and dividend restrictions 
there can be no assurances that the company or uahc tn will be granted the necessary approvals for new products or will maintain federal qualifications or state licensure 
the licensing and operation of uahc tn are governed by the tennessee statutes and regulations applicable to health maintenance organizations 
the licenses are subject to denial  limitation  suspension or revocation if there is a determination that the plan is operating out of compliance with the state s hmo statute  failing to provide quality health services  establishing rates that are unfair or unreasonable  failing to fulfill obligations under outstanding agreements or operating on an unsound fiscal basis 
uahc tn is not a federally qualified hmo and  therefore  is not subject to the federal hmo act 
federal and state regulation of health care plans and managed care products is subject to frequent change  varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and generally gives responsible administrative agencies broad discretion 
laws and regulations relating to the company s business are subject to amendment and or interpretation in each jurisdiction 
in particular  legislation mandating managed care for medicaid recipients is often subject to change and may not initially be accompanied by administrative rules and guidelines 
changes in federal or state governmental regulation could affect the company s operations  profitability and business prospects 
while the company is unable to predict what additional government regulations  if any  affecting its business may be enacted in the future or how existing or future regulations may be interpreted  regulatory revisions may have a material adverse effect on the company 
insurance the company presently carries comprehensive general liability  directors and officers liability  property  business automobile  and workers compensation insurance 
management believes that coverage levels under these policies are adequate in view of the risks associated with the company s business 
in addition  uahc tn has and omnicare mi while managed by the company had professional liability insurance that covers liability claims arising from medical malpractice 
uahc tn is required to pay the professional liability insurance premiums under the terms of the company s management agreement 
there can be no assurance as to the future availability or cost of such insurance  or that the company s business risks will be maintained within the limits of such insurance coverage 
competition the managed care industry is highly competitive 
the company directly competes with other entities that provide health care plan management services  some of which are nonprofit corporations and others  which have significantly greater financial and administrative resources 
the company primarily competes on the basis of fee arrangements  cost effectiveness and the range and quality of services offered to prospective health care clients 
while the company believes that its experience gives it certain competitive advantages over existing and potential new competitors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively in the future 
the company competes with other hmos  ppos and insurance companies 
the level of this competition may affect  among other things  the operating revenues of uahc tn and  therefore  the revenues of the company 
uahc tn s primary market competitors in western tennessee are tlc  better health plans and tenncare select 
uahc tn primarily competes on the basis of enrollment  provider networks and other related plan features and criteria 
management believes that uahc tn is able to compete effectively with its primary market competitors 
employees the company s ability to maintain its competitive position and expand its business into new markets depends  in significant part  upon the maintenance of its relationships with various existing senior officers  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified health care management professionals 
the company neither has nor intends to pursue any long term employment agreement with any of its key personnel 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such relationships or attract such professionals 
the total number of employees at august  was compared to at august  the company s employees do not belong to a collective bargaining unit and management considers its relations with employees to be good

omnicare health plan  in michigan omnicare mi  an hmo then administered by the company under a management agreement  was placed in court ordered rehabilitation proceedings on july   which relieved the company from further funding omnicare mi s capital deficiencies and which continued its omnicare mi management agreement  with substantially reduced management fee revenues from omnicare mi beginning august  in march  upon the court appointed rehabilitator s filing a proposed rehabilitation plan for omnicare mi  the company announced it anticipated eventual termination of the management agreement 
such termination occurred november   after which the company s only managed plan has been uahc health plan  inc formerly called omnicare health plan  inc uahc tn  an hmo  which is owned by the company s wholly owned subsidiary 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements in this annual report have been restated to present the operations related to managing omnicare mi as a discontinued operation 
beginning july   tenncare implemented an month stabilization program which entailed changes to tenncare s contracts with mcos  including uahc tn 
during that period  mcos were generally compensated for administrative services only commonly called aso  earned fixed administrative fees  were not at risk for medical costs in excess of targets established based on various factors  were subject to increased oversight  and could incur financial penalties for not achieving certain performance requirements 
through successive contractual amendments  tenncare extended the aso reimbursement system applicable to uahc tn first through june   then through december   and then through june  these matters are more fully discussed and analyzed below under the heading review of consolidated results of operations compared to review of consolidated results of operations compared to uahc tn developments uahc tn s results of operations for fiscal and are best understood in the context of certain earlier events involving several of tenncare s major contracted mcos  which ceased doing business in fiscal beginning in february  march and april  uahc tn unexpectedly noticed increases in its claims payments  investigated  and found that approximately  new members added in september december represented children with special needs with medical costs over of the premiums received  and that many members transferred to uahc tn from failed mcos also had medical costs in excess of uahc tn s premiums received 
beginning in april  uahc tn wrote to tenncare seeking risk adjustments and reimbursements to compensate uahc tn for such medical expenses  including for actuarially estimated claims incurred but not yet reported to uahc tn 
tenncare responded to its mcos situation generally and in some instances individually 
for all its contracted mcos generally  tenncare changed its reimbursement system to an administrative services only aso program for an month stabilization period july  through december   during which the mcos including uahc tn have no medical cost risk ie  no risk for medical losses  earn fixed administrative fees and are subject to increased oversight 
through successive contractual amendments  tenncare extended the aso reimbursement system applicable to uahc tn  first through june   then through december   and then through june  through an amendment with an effective date of july   tenncare has implemented a modified risk arrangement with all its contracted mcos  including uahc tn  which are at risk for losing up to of administrative fee revenue and may receive up to incentive bonus revenue based on performance relative to benchmarks 
tenncare has also announced plans to disenroll non medically needy adults who are not eligible for medicaid from tenncare coverage statewide  and to impose benefit limits on the  adults left in the program who are eligible for medicaid 
the announced plans would preserve full coverage for the  children on the program 
as a result  uahc tn expects to lose only approximately  of its present  members over a month period beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  being its only working uninsured and uninsurable adult members 
pursuant to a notice of administrative supervision issued by the commissioner of the state of tennessee s department of commerce and insurance on april   to our subsidiary  uahc tn was placed under administrative supervision of the commissioner and has until december  to demonstrate to the commissioner s satisfaction that its continued operation and business  absent the supervision or other oversight by the commissioner  is not hazardous  financially or operationally  to its enrollees  its creditors or the public 
uahc tn received no prior notice of the notice and order of administrative supervision and had no opportunity to respond to its factual assertions 
uahc tn and the company are fully cooperating with the state of tennessee in accordance with the terms of the order  and we do not currently anticipate any material developments during the supervision period 
the administrative supervision order prohibits uahc tn from taking certain actions  including making any payments  without the approval of the commissioner s appointed administrative supervisor during the supervision 
it is important to recognize that administrative supervision is significantly different than receivership and that uahc tn is not in receivership 
the administrative supervision notice asserted a number of findings of fact  which the commissioner stated formed the basis for her order 
uahc tn and the company do not agree with many of those findings 
the notice also asserted that its findings of fact described potential grounds for termination of uahc tn s tenncare contract 
although we acknowledge that any such termination would have a material adverse effect on uahc tn and the company  we do not agree that those findings are accurate 
moreover  the state of tennessee in august extended uahc tn s tenncare contract through june   by an amendment to the contract effective as of july  on may   and effective as of january   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  united american of tennessee  inc ua tn  which already owned of the outstanding stock of uahc tn  purchased the remaining of the outstanding common stock of uahc tn 
uahc tn thereby became a wholly owned subsidiary of ua tn and a wholly owned second tier subsidiary of the company 
the minority interest was purchased under a longstanding option agreement for  evidenced by a company promissory note that was paid by december  as of june   uahc tn s total enrollment was  members  compared to  at june  omnicare mi developments it should be noted initially in this discussion that the company s longstanding management agreement with omnicare mi ended effective november  the consolidated financial statements have been restated to present the operations related to managing omnicare mi as a discontinued operation 
as a michigan hmo  omnicare mi is subject to oversight by the state of michigan s commissioner of the office of financial and insurance services the commissioner 
on july   pursuant to a motion by the commissioner  a state circuit court judge entered an order of rehabilitation of omnicare mi the order and appointed the commissioner as rehabilitator of omnicare mi 
the order directed the rehabilitator to administer all of omnicare mi s assets and business while attempting to effectuate its rehabilitation  preserve its provider network and maintain uninterrupted health care services to the greatest extent possible 
pursuant to and since the order  through the management agreement s termination date  the rehabilitator s appointed special deputy served as the chief executive officer of omnicare mi 
the order beneficially relieved the company from further funding omnicare mi s capital deficiencies through unsecured loans and forgiving earned management fees 
the order required the company to continue performing all services under its omnicare mi management agreement  which continued through october  that agreement terminated november  pursuant to notice received from omnicare mi in accordance with its amended rehabilitation plan  which a state circuit court judge approved on july  because of its resulting workforce reduction  the company made plans to sublease all of its then principal office premises in detroit  michigan  to omnicare mi  retroactive to november   and expiring at the lease end in may  and to sell to omnicare mi furniture  a telephone system and certain computer hardware and software that the company chose to leave there 
omnicare mi commenced its occupancy of the premises on november  and the company remained in a portion of the premises until it moved its principal offices to new leased premises in detroit on february  management had expected both parties to finalize and sign the sublease  and close the sale of such assets  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  but was delayed as a result of the appointment by the governor of michigan of linda a 
watters as the new commissioner of the office of financial and insurance services on april  ms 
watters had served on the company s board of directors continually since and resigned that office on the same date she became the new commissioner as required to avoid any possible appearance of a conflict of interest and not as the result of any disagreement with the company 
because of the new commissioner s prior association with the company  the state circuit court judge who retained jurisdiction over omnicare mi s rehabilitation proceedings then required that a designated independent person replace the rehabilitator s ie  commissioner s special deputy who had been dealing with the sublease and assets purchase 
meanwhile  due to the subsequent sale of omnicare mi members to coventry of michigan approved on may  and effective october   the sale of assets did not occur and the company accordingly recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company renegotiated sublease terms with michigan hmo formerly doing business as omnicare health plan in michigan  which continued to occupy and pay rent for reduced space in such premises 
michigan hmo s occupancy and rent obligation for the subleased premises ceased on february  sooner than the primary lease end in may the company recorded a liability in the first quarter of fiscal year as it relates to the sublease obligation 
specific comparisons of to total revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   practically unchanged year over year 
medical premiums revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million from medical premiums revenues of million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease came from uahc tn as the result of tenncare s changing its reimbursement system to an aso program for an initially declared month stabilization period beginning july   subsequently extended through june  fixed administrative fees related to the aso program were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million from fixed administrative fees of million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in fixed administrative fees is principally due to a slight increase in members of uahc tn 
total expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase was principally due to an increase in costs associated with the administrative supervision order for uahc tn discussed above  and an increase in claims processing costs 
because of tenncare s aso reimbursement system  medical services expenses were million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million  as compared with medical services expenses of million in the fiscal year ended june  the million of medical services expenses represent fiscal claims processed and reimbursed by tenncare in fiscal as explained in item under the heading managed plans managed plan owned by the company 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared with marketing  general and administrative expenses of million for the comparable period a year earlier  a increase of million 
the increase was principally due to an increase in costs associated with the administrative supervision order for uahc tn discussed above  and an increase in claims processing costs 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  interest expense decreased million  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june   principally due to debt reduction 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
such decrease in earnings from continuing operations of million  or per basic share  is principally due to an increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses 
income tax expense increased million  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the company s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june  is and differs from the statutory rate of

medical claims payable decreased by million at june  compared to june   which is directly related to the payment of outstanding medical claims 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary  uahc tn  had a required minimum net worth requirement using statutory accounting practices of million at june  uahc tn had excess statutory net worth of million at june  uahc tn s application for a commercial hmo license was approved on september  management is not yet actively pursuing that commercial business  however  due to uahc tn s substantially increased enrollment from members tenncare assigned from defunct other plans  together with adapting to tenncare s stabilization program 
beginning july   tenncare implemented an month stabilization program  which entailed changes to tenncare s contracts with mcos  including uahc tn 
during that period  mcos are generally compensated for administrative services only commonly called aso  earned fixed administrative fees  were not at risk for medical costs in excess of targets established based on various factors  were subject to increased oversight  and could incur financial penalties for not achieving certain performance requirements 
through successive contractual amendments  tenncare extended the aso reimbursement system applicable to uahc tn  first through june   then through december   and then through june  through an amendment with an effective date of july   tenncare has implemented a modified risk arrangement with all its contracted mcos  including uahc tn  which are at risk for losing up to of administrative fee revenue and may receive up to incentive bonus revenue based on performance relative to benchmarks 
tenncare has also announced plans to disenroll non medically needy adults who are not eligible for medicaid from tenncare coverage statewide  and to impose benefit limits on the  adults left in the program who are eligible for medicaid 
the announced plans would preserve full coverage for the  children on the program 
as a result  uahc tn expects to lose only approximately  of its present  members over a month period beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  being its only working uninsured and uninsurable adult members 
the company and the department of finance and administration of the state of tennessee  bureau of tenncare tenncare are parties to two escrow agreements under which the company has funded  on august   two escrow accounts held by tenncare at the state treasury 
one  in the amount of  is security for repayment to tenncare of any overpayments to uahc tn that may be determined by a pending audit of all uahc tn process claims since  and the other  in the amount of  is security for any money damages that may be awarded to tenncare in the event of any future litigation between the parties in connection with certain pending investigations by state and federal authorities 
the escrow accounts bear interest at a rate no lower than the prevailing commercial interest rates for savings accounts at financial institutions in nashville  tennessee 
the escrow accounts will terminate august  or sooner in certain events  except if litigation is pursued by either party  in which event the escrow accounts will continue until the end of such litigation 
all amounts including interest earnings credited to the escrow accounts will belong to the company  except to the extent  if any  they are paid to tenncare to satisfy amounts determined to be owed to tenncare as provided in the escrow agreements 
both escrow agreements recite that tenncare does not at this time assert there has been any breach of uahc tn s tenncare contract and that the company has funded the escrow accounts as a show of goodwill and good faith in working with tenncare 
pursuant to a notice of administrative supervision issued by the commissioner of the state of tennessee s department of commerce and insurance on april   to our subsidiary  uahc tn was placed under administrative supervision of the commissioner and has until december  to demonstrate to the commissioner s satisfaction that its continued operation and business  absent the supervision or other oversight by the commissioner  is not hazardous  financially or operationally  to its enrollees  its creditors or the public 
uahc tn received no prior notice of the notice and order of administrative supervision and had no opportunity to respond to its factual assertions 
uahc tn and the company are fully cooperating with the state of tennessee in accordance with the terms of the order  and we do not currently anticipate any material developments during the supervision period 
the administrative supervision order prohibits uahc tn from taking certain actions  including making any payments  without the approval of the commissioner s appointed administrative supervisor during the supervision 
it is important to recognize that administrative supervision is significantly different than receivership and that uahc tn is not in receivership 
the administrative supervision notice asserted a number of findings of fact which the commissioner stated formed the basis for her order 
uahc tn and the company do not agree with many of those findings 
the notice also asserted that its findings of fact described potential grounds for termination of uahc tn s tenncare contract 
although we acknowledge that any such termination would have a material adverse effect on uahc tn and the company  we do not agree that those findings are accurate 
moreover  the state of tennessee in august extended uahc tn s tenncare contract through june   by an amendment to the contract effective as of july  the company s de facto sublease to omnicare mi of the company s leased premises in detroit  michigan  from november  to the end of the lease in may cost the company approximately  per month through november due to the subsequent sale of omnicare mi members to coventry of michigan approved on may  and effective october   the sale of assets did not occur and the company accordingly recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company renegotiated sublease terms with michigan hmo formerly doing business as omnicare health plan in michigan  which continued to occupy and pay rent for reduced space in such premises 
michigan hmo s occupancy and rent obligation for the subleased premises ceased on february  sooner than the primary lease end in may the company recorded a liability in the first quarter of fiscal year as it relates to the sublease obligation 
those events would increase the company s rent expense under that lease  but management cannot currently predict the timing and amount thereof 
the company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its future cash needs depends on a number of factors  particularly including its ability to control administrative costs  related to the new modified risk arrangement for the tenncare program beginning july  and controlling corporate overhead costs 
on the basis of the matters discussed above  management believes at this time that the company has the ability to generate sufficient cash to adequately support its financial requirements through the next twelve months  and maintain minimum statutory net worth requirements of uahc tn 
recently enacted pronouncements the following are new accounting standards and interpretations that may be applicable in the future to the company sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a replacement to sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  was issued in december the revisions are intended to provide investors and other users of financial statements with more complete and neutral financial information by requiring that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
 as originally issued in  established a preferable fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb opinion no 
 as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
publicly traded entities other than those filing as small business issuers will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  the company is currently evaluating the financial statement impact of the adoption of sfas no

sfas no 
 inventory costs  which amends arb no 
chapter  inventory pricing  was issued in november the amendments made by sfas no 
provide clarity relating to abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage  which should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is expected to have no effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
