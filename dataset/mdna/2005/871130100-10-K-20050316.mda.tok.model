item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business we are a global enterprise software company that derives revenues primarily from the sale and support of enterprise and mobile software solutions to business and government users 
our value proposition involves enabling the unwired enterprise through integrated applications and solutions designed to manage information across the enterprise  allowing customers to extract more value from their information technology it investments 
our solutions unlock  integrate  and seamlessly deliver nearly all types of data  whether in a database  a transaction  or an application  anywhere  anytime and on any platform 
we deliver a full range of mobile enterprise solutions that includes mobile databases  middleware  synchronization  and management software 
our business is organized into three business segments ipg  which principally focuses on enterprise class database servers  integration and development products  ias  which provides mobile database and mobile enterprise solutions  and ffi  which delivers integrated banking  payment and trade messaging solutions to large financial institutions 
during  approximately percent of our revenues were generated from the us with the balance generated from our non us operations 
for further discussion of our business segments and principal products  see business  part i  item on april  we acquired xcellenet  inc xcellenet a privately held provider of frontline device management software 
this acquisition was made to strengthen the company s position in the mobile middleware market and bring important enhancements to our unwired enterprise offerings 
see note eleven to consolidated financial statements business combinations  part ii  item 
table of contents our results total revenues were million for  compared to million for  and million for the increase in total revenues from to was primarily due to a million percent increase in ias revenues offset by a million percent decline in ipg revenues 
without consideration of xcellenet the ias revenue growth would have been million percent for we believe our ias revenues will remain strong as we continue to integrate and leverage our xcellenet acquisition  and as our unwired enterprise initiative gains momentum 
the decline in the revenue of our ipg segment was attributable to a percent decline in license revenues primarily those derived from our core database products 
while we expect the market for our core database products to remain challenging  we are encouraged that ipg license revenues increased during both the third and fourth quarters of when compared to the same periods in  as well as the sales and interest generated by several products that became generally available during the third quarter of  including our real time database ase and mirror activator 
we reported net income of million for  compared to net income of million for  and net income of million in before the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
our operating margin was percent compared to percent in the decrease was partially attributable a million increase in restructuring costs incurred in compared to see note thirteen to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  and partially attributable to the inclusion of operating losses of xcellenet 
the acquisition of xcellenet had an adverse impact of approximately million on our operating margin 
the loss generated by xcellenet was largely attributable to the purchase accounting write down of approximately million in xcellenet s deferred revenues associated with technical support services which otherwise would have been recognized in our overall financial position remains strong 
during we generated net cash from operating activities of million  and had million in cash  cash equivalents and cash investments including restricted stock at december  our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days for the quarter ended december  compared to days for the quarter ended december   the largest factor contributing to this increase was our increase in license revenues 
for a discussion of certain factors that may impact our business and financial results  see future operating results  below 
business trends the market for new sales of enterprise infrastructure software continues to be challenging due to various factors  including a maturing enterprise infrastructure software market  and changing patterns in information technology spending 
as was the case in  the majority of our license fee revenues during came from sales to our existing customers 
in recent years  fewer of our customers have undertaken large scale infrastructure investments requiring significant investment in our core enterprise database products and related services this also contributed to a decline in our consulting and education revenues 
we believe this is partly due to market saturation in some of our target markets including financial services  insurance and telecommunications where large enterprises have invested heavily in their core database infrastructures during the past years 
in the future  we believe that much of the industry s growth will be generated by sales to middle market companies 
we believe we are positioned to exploit this growth opportunity with various initiatives including our strategic partnership with sap focused on providing enterprise level software to small and medium sized businesses 
we continue to observe a changing trend in historical it spending patterns 
specifically  while we continue to see an overall increase in our transaction volume for license revenues  the average dollar value of these transactions is lower than historical amounts 
this pattern supports our view that fiscally cautious customers generally are continuing to purchase products and services based more 
table of contents on present need and less on fulfilling anticipated future needs 
overall  mixed signs of a strong and sustained us and global economic recovery make it difficult to project whether and to what extent the overall market for enterprise infrastructure software will materially improve 
we do note  however  that while our results in the first two quarters of were disappointing  we reported revenue growth and strong operating results in the third and fourth quarters  both of which exceeded analyst expectations 
moving forward  we will continue to manage our operating expenses as we aggressively pursue our unwired enterprise initiative and strategic alliances with our key partners including sap  intel  and others 
for further discussion of the effect of current business trends on our results of operations  see future operation results  below 
we also believe that we are well positioned to compete within several growing market segments including mobility solutions  data analytic tools  and linux based enterprise software 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we also are required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  restructuring  income taxes  stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances 
our management has reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
further  changes in accounting and legal standards could adversely affect our future operating results see future operating results  below 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  restructuring  income taxes  stock based compensation  and contingencies and liabilities  each of which are discussed below 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue  although certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
these judgments would include  for example  the determination of a customer s creditworthiness  whether two separate transactions with a customer should be accounted for as a single transaction  or whether included services are essential to the functionality of a product thereby requiring percentage of completion accounting rather than software accounting 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements 
license fee revenues are recognized when a a non cancelable license agreement is in force  b the product has been delivered  c the license fee is fixed or determinable  and d collection is reasonably assured 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
residual method accounting 
in software arrangements that include multiple elements eg  license rights and technical support services  we allocate the total fees among each of the elements using the residual method of accounting 
under this method  revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements  and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
vendor specific objective evidence of 
table of contents fair value for such undelivered elements is based upon the price we charge for such product or service when it is sold separately 
we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which would result in changes to our vendor specific objective evidence 
as a result  future revenue associated with multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results 
percentage of completion accounting 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment of the licenses  provided i the criteria described in subparagraphs a through d above are met  ii payment of the license fee is not dependent upon performance of the consulting services  and iii the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or performance of services is a condition to payment of license fees  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
under this method  we are required to estimate the number of total hours needed to complete a project  and revenues and profits are recognized based on the percentage of total contract hours as they are completed 
due to the complexity involved in the estimating process  revenues and profits recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting are subject to revision as contract phases are actually completed 
historically  these revisions have not been material 
sublicense revenues 
we recognize sublicense fees as reported to us by our licensees 
license fees for certain application development and data access tools are recognized upon direct shipment by us to the end user or upon direct shipment to the reseller for resale to the end user 
if collection is not reasonably assured in advance  revenue is recognized only when sublicense fees are actually collected 
service revenues 
technical support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related support agreement  which in most cases is one year 
revenues from consulting services under time and materials contracts  and for education  are recognized as services are performed 
revenues from other contract services are generally recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting described above 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets have generally resulted from our business combinations accounted for as purchases 
we are required to test amounts recorded as goodwill or recorded as intangible assets with indeterminate lives  at least annually for impairment 
the review of goodwill and indeterminate lived intangibles for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires us to make numerous estimates to determine both the fair values and the carrying values of our reporting units to which goodwill is assigned 
for these purposes  our reporting units equate to our reported segments 
see note ten to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value  we are required to perform an analysis similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
this analysis requires a valuation of certain other intangible assets including in process research and development  and developed technology 
our impairment testing resulted in the first quarter of  in a cumulative effect of an accounting change of million and in the fourth quarter of  a goodwill impairment of million 
as of december   our goodwill balance totaled million 
we performed our annual impairment analysis as of december  for each of our reporting units and for each indeterminate lived intangible 
this analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit or indeterminate lived intangible exceeded its carrying value 
therefore  we were not required to recognize an impairment loss in however  changes in our internal business structure  changes in our future revenue and expense forecasts  and certain other factors that directly impact the valuation of our reporting units could result in a future impairment charge 
a goodwill impairment charge is based on the value of a reporting unit at the testing date 
accordingly  reporting units that previously reported an impairment charge as was the case with ffi in are particularly prone to additional impairment charges if future revenue and expense forecasts or market conditions 
table of contents worsen after the testing date 
this is because any subsequent reduction of fair value after a testing date would have a strong likelihood of triggering an additional impairment charge 
we continue to review our other intangible assets eg  purchased technology  trade names and customer lists for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
for these purposes  recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing their carrying values to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
this methodology requires us to estimate future cash flows associated with certain assets or groups of assets 
changes in these estimates could result in impairment losses associated with other intangible assets 
see note one to consolidated financial statements goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  part ii  item allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
additional allowances might be required if deteriorating economic conditions or other factors affect our customers ability to make timely payments 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs after a product becomes technologically feasible and before its general release to customers 
significant judgment is required in determining when a product becomes technologically feasible 
capitalized development costs are then amortized over the product s estimated life beginning upon general release of the product 
quarterly  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and selling the product the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products and the future costs of completing and selling certain products 
changes in these estimates could result in write offs of capitalized software costs 
restructuring we have recorded significant accruals in connection with various restructuring activities 
these accruals include estimated net costs to settle certain lease obligations based on analysis of independent real estate consultants 
while we do not anticipate significant changes to these estimates in the future  the actual costs may differ from estimates 
for example  if we are able to negotiate more affordable termination fees  if rental rates increase in the markets where the properties are located  or if we are able to locate suitable sublease tenants more quickly than expected  the actual costs could be lower than our estimates 
in that case  we would reduce our restructuring accrual with a corresponding credit to cost of restructuring 
alternatively  if we are unable to negotiate affordable termination fees  if rental rates decrease in the markets where the properties are located  or if it takes us longer than expected to find suitable sublease tenants  the actual costs could exceed our estimates 
for example  in the fourth quarter of we added approximately million to our facility related restructuring accruals due to revisions to expected sublease income provided by our real estate consultants with respect to a property located in colorado 
see note thirteen to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that likely will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the 
table of contents valuation allowance 
if we determine during any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset and record a corresponding reduction to our income tax expense for the period 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset and record a charge to income tax expense for the period 
our gross deferred tax asset at december  was million upon which we have recorded a corresponding valuation allowance of million 
significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences e 
g  the income we earn within the united states could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
see note eight to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item stock based compensation sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  currently encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we have continued to account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method 
under that method  compensation cost for stock options granted to employees is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
however  as of july   we will be required to apply fasb statement r  share based payment  which will require us to measure compensation cost for all share based payments at fair value 
see note one to consolidated financial statements stock based compensation  and other recent accounting pronouncements  part ii  item 
table of contents contingencies and liabilities we are involved from time to time in various proceedings  lawsuits and claims involving our customers  products  intellectual property  stockholders and employees  among other things 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
when we reasonably determine that a loss associated with any of these matters is probable  and can reasonably estimate the loss  we record a reserve to provide for such loss contingencies 
if we are unable to record a reserve because we are not able to estimate the amount of a potential loss in a matter  or if we determine that a loss is not probable  we are nevertheless required to disclose certain information regarding such matter if we determine that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
because of the inherent uncertainties related to these types of matters  we base our loss reserves on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reevaluate our assessment regarding the probability of a matter or its expected loss 
our financial position or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by such revisions in our estimates

results of operations revenues dollars in millions change change license fees by segment ipg ias ffi eliminations total license fees percentage of total revenues services by segment ipg ias ffi eliminations total services percentage of total revenues total revenues not meaningful total license fees for increased slightly from total license fees in which had decreased percent from 
the increase in license fees revenues during was primarily attributable to million in ias license revenues generated by products acquired in the xcellenet acquisition along with a million increase in license revenues from the ias segment s sql anywhere product 
this increase was partially offset by a million decline in ipg license revenues from our adaptive server enterprise product 
reasons for the decline in ipg license revenues for are discussed above in overview  above  and future operating results below 
as noted above  a decline in license revenues relating to our adaptive server enterprise product was the biggest contributer to the overall decline in ipg license fees 
partially offsetting this decline was increased license revenues from our replication server and adaptive server iq products 

table of contents the increase in ias license revenues was primarily attributable to products discussed above 
before consideration of license revenues from products acquired in the xcellenet acquisition  the license revenues of the ias segment would have increased percent for ffi license revenues are largely dependent upon closing large multi million dollar transactions 
as a result  the year over year results for ffi tend to fluctuate greatly 
the increase in ffi license revenues for was primarily attributable to increased sales of the segment s core banking application in north america 
in  the most significant decline in license fees revenues resulted from a decline the sales of certain ipg integration and access products largely due a major shift in the business of one of our largest north american resellers that significantly lowered the reseller s need to use our technology as part of its offering 
our revenues from this reseller continued to decline in and are no longer significant 
segment revenues includes transactions between the segments  and in the most common instance relates to the sale of ias and ffi products and services by the ipg segment 
in the case of such a transaction  the segment recording the sale also records an intercompany expense on the transaction  with a corresponding intercompany revenue amount recorded by the segment whose product was sold 
the net amount retained by the segment that recorded the sale is intended to reflect the costs incurred by such transferring segment 
the total transfers between the segments are captured in eliminations 
total service revenues for which include revenues from technical support  education  and professional services increased percent from total service revenues in this increase was primarily due to million in technical support revenues associated with the xcellenet business  and a percent increase million in ffi professional services revenues that primarily resulted from several large consulting engagements in north america 
xcellenet contributed million to the ias segment s service revenues primarily technical support in technical support revenue for increased percent million from the total and the deferred revenue related to technical support contracts at december  was up percent from the deferred revenue related to such contracts at december  approximately percent of services revenues in each of and related to technical support revenues 
other services revenues declined percent in from the increase in ffi s professional services revenues discussed above was largely offset by a percent decline million in ipg professional services revenues and a percent million decline in education services 
the slight decline in services revenues was due to a drop in ipg and ffi consulting and education revenues  partially offset by an increase in ipg and ias technical support revenues 
the decrease in consulting and education revenues was primarily attributable to the reasons discussed in the business trends section in overview  above 
the technical support revenues were driven by new license revenues combined with a steady level of support renewals by existing customers

this decrease was largely offset by a million increase in license fees revenues from products included in the ias segment and a million increase in consulting revenues 
in  the decline in north america revenues was primarily due to the decline in license fees from ipg integration products 
as discussed in revenues  above  we believe a major shift in the business of one of our largest north american resellers during resulted in significantly lower sales of certain integration products during as well as a continued decline in such revenues for emea europe  middle east and africa revenues for increased percent from the increase was due to a million increase in license fees revenues from products included in the ias segment and a million increase in technical support services revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a million drop in license fees revenues from products included in the ipg segment and a million decline in professional services revenues 
increased revenues in the uk contributed most to the overall increase for in  the slight decline in emea revenues was attributable to lower revenues from integration and access products  largely offset by an increase in revenues from our enterprise database products 
the increase in intercontinental asia pacific and latin america revenues for was primarily due to a million increase in license fees revenues from enterprise database products and a million increase in technical support and professional services revenues 
the results of our operations in china  australia  india  korea  and new zealand contributed most significantly to the increased revenue  offsetting lower revenues in japan and hong kong 
the percent decrease in intercontinental revenues compared to was due a drop in license fees and services revenues from our enterprise database products 
the results of our operations in brazil  china  korea  and taiwan contributed most significantly to the decline in revenues  offset by increased revenues in japan 
in emea and the intercontinental region  most revenues and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
the cumulative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from to resulted in a percent increase in our revenues and a percent increase in our operating expenses 
the cumulative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from to resulted in a percent increase in our revenues and a percent increase in our operating expenses 
the change for both comparable periods was primarily due to the weakness of the us dollar against certain european currencies 

table of contents our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  even though we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the strength of local economies  and the general volatility of worldwide software markets could result in a higher or lower proportion of international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the future

we believe that much of the decrease in our spending on marketing resulted from a more effective use of our marketing dollars including the utilization of coordinated market programs with our strategic partners and a more focused internal coordination of marketing programs and messages 
we allocate various common costs  primarily certain telecommunications and facilities related expenses  to sales and marketing  product development and engineering  and general and administrative expenses 
the percent decrease in sales and marketing expense in compared to was primarily due to a substantial decrease in spending on marketing programs  a decrease in sales and marketing personnel as a result of our and restructuring activities  and a reduction in sales commissions principally due to lower license fees revenues  and a decrease in certain allocated common costs

provision for income taxes dollars in millions change change provision for income taxes in a provision for income taxes was recorded at a rate of approximately percent on income before taxes 
our effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate of percent primarily due to adjustments for the difference between estimated amounts recorded and actual liabilities resulting from the filing of prior years tax returns  the utilization of japanese net operating losses  additional tax reserves relating primarily to foreign transfer pricing exposures and the release of tax reserves upon the completion of various tax audits 
without the benefit of the japanese net operating losses  adjustments for the difference resulting from the filing of the prior years tax returns and for tax reserves  our effective tax rate for the year would have been approximately percent 

table of contents in a provision for income taxes was recorded at a rate of approximately percent on income before taxes 
our effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate of percent primarily due to the utilization of certain foreign tax credits upon which a full valuation allowance was provided  the release of certain deferred tax liabilities which were made unnecessary when we were able to restructure certain earnings of a foreign subsidiaries in a manner to allow for their repatriation free from the withholding taxes we provided for with the deferred tax liability  and the release of certain tax reserves upon the completion of various tax audits 
in a provision for income taxes was recorded at a rate of approximately percent on income before taxes and the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
our effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate of percent primarily due to non deductible charges associated with the impairment loss on certain goodwill  and the impact of state taxes 
we had a net deferred tax asset of million at december  this deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance of million 
as of december   the gross deferred tax asset included a research and development tax credit of million  foreign tax credits of million and an asset for certain net operating losses of million 
the research and development tax credits expire from through  the foreign tax credits expire from through  and the net operating losses expire from through in order to realize our net deferred tax assets we must generate sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain the recorded benefit from the reversal of temporary differences ie  between book and tax basis  and from tax credit carryforwards 
specifically  realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately million of future taxable income  largely in the us based on the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
any such adjustments to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such adjustment was made 
the valuation allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets associated with acquired net operating losses  net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards  tax assets associated with stock option activity  and foreign tax credits 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses and capital losses acquired in  or attributable to  the nen and avantgo acquisitions 
if the associated deferred tax assets are realized  the benefit from their realization will reduce goodwill carried on our books associated with these acquisitions 
the valuation allowance also includes approximately million associated with stock option activity for which any recognized tax benefits will be credited directly to shareholders equity

the related foreign currency translation gains and losses from translating these amounts into us dollars for subsidiaries that conduct their business in a currency other than the us dollar  are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss under stockholders equity on the balance sheet 
as of december   we had identifiable net assets totaling million associated with our emea operations and million associated with our intercontinental operations 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have material adverse or beneficial impacts on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposures have related sales and expenses in emea  asia pacific  and latin america which are denominated in a 
table of contents currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary recording the transaction 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
specifically  we enter into forward contracts with a maturity of approximately days to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure created by certain balances that are denominated in a currency other than the principal reporting currency of the entity recording the transaction 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts are meant to mitigate the gains and losses on these outstanding foreign currency transactions 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in interest expense and other  net

table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  which consists of taxable  short term money market instruments and debt securities with maturities between days and three years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our investment portfolio  since all investments are made in securities with fixed interest rates 
default risk we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe  high investment grade securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers

we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our investment portfolio  since all investments are made in securities with fixed interest rates 
future operating results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period due to a variety of significant risks  some of which are discussed below and elsewhere in this report on form k 
we strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risks contained in this report including those regarding forward looking statements described on page significant variation in the timing and amount of our revenues may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and accurate estimation of our revenues is difficult 
our operating results have varied from quarter to quarter in the past and may vary in the future depending upon a number of factors described below  including many that are beyond our control 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results should not be relied on to indicate our future performance 
we operate with little or no backlog  and our quarterly license revenues depend largely on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  we have recorded a majority of our quarterly license revenues in the last month of each quarter  particularly during the final two weeks 
in recent periods  we have experienced fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our customers 
for example  during and the first half of  we experienced an overall increase in the volume of license revenue transactions but an overall decrease in the average dollar value of these transactions 
during the fourth quarter of  our average dollar value for these transactions increased significantly over the fourth quarter of  but the total number of orders declined 
although many of our customers are larger enterprises  an apparent trend toward more conservative it spending could result in fewer of these customers making substantial investments in our products and services in any given period 
therefore  if one or more significant orders do not close in a particular quarter  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  as was the case in the first and second quarters of our operating expenses are based on projected annual and quarterly revenue levels  and are generally incurred ratably throughout each quarter 
since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  failure to realize projected revenues for a specified period could adversely impact operating results  reducing net income or causing an operating loss for that period 
the deferral or non occurrence of such revenues would materially adversely affect our operating results for that quarter and could impair our business in future periods 
because we do not know when  or if  our potential customers will place orders and finalize contracts  we cannot accurately predict our revenue and operating results for future quarters 
in addition to the above factors  the timing and amount of our revenues are subject to a number of factors that make it difficult to accurately estimate revenues and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
for example  in the first and second quarters of fiscal  our results fell short of our previously announced forecasts for those periods 
in our experience revenues in the fourth quarter benefit from large enterprise customers placing orders before the expiration of budgets tied to the calendar year 
as a result  revenues from license fees tend to decline from the fourth quarter of one year to the first quarter of the 
table of contents next year 
in the past  this seasonality has contributed to lower total revenues and earnings in the first quarter compared to the prior fourth quarter 
we cannot assure you that estimates of our revenues and operating results can be made with certain accuracy or predictability 
fluctuations in our operating results may contribute to volatility in our stock price 
economic conditions in the us and worldwide could adversely affect our revenues 
our revenues and operating results depend on the overall demand for our products and services 
general weakening of the us and worldwide economy in recent years contributed to a decrease in our revenues from to economic uncertainty caused many of our customers to delay or significantly reduce discretionary spending for larger infrastructure it projects  which contributed to the decline in our revenues from to in part due to improvements in the worldwide economy  our revenues exceeded revenues by 
if the us and worldwide economies do not continue to stabilize and improve  or if these economies weaken  either alone or in tandem with other factors beyond our control including war  political unrest  shifts in market demand for our products  etc  we may not be able to maintain or expand our recent revenue growth 
if we fail to maintain or expand our relationships with strategic partners and indirect distribution channels our license revenues could decline 
we currently derive a significant portion of our license revenues from sales of our products and services through non exclusive distribution channels  including strategic partners  systems integrators sis  original equipment manufacturers oems and value added resellers vars 
we generally anticipate that sales of our products through these channels will account for a substantial portion of our license revenues in the foreseeable future 
because most of our channel relationships are non exclusive  there is a risk that some or all of them could promote or sell our competitors products instead of ours  or that they will be unable to effectively sell new products that we may introduce 
additionally  if we are unable to expand our indirect channels  or these indirect channels fail to generate significant revenues in the future  our business could be harmed 
our development  marketing and distribution strategies also depend in part on our ability to form strategic relationships with other technology companies 
if these companies change their business focus  enter into strategic alliances with other companies or are acquired by our competitors or others  support for our products could be reduced or eliminated  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
industry consolidation and other competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for our products and services  and our business may be adversely affected 
the it industry and the market for our core database infrastructure products and services is becoming increasingly competitive due to a variety of factors including a maturing enterprise infrastructure software market  changes in customer it spending habits  and mixed economic recovery in the us there also appears to be a growing trend toward consolidation in the software industry  as evidenced by oracle s recent acquisition of peoplesoft  symantec s announcement that it will acquire veritas  peoplesoft s acquisition of jd edwards  and ibm s acquisition of the informix database business 
continued consolidation within the software industry could create opportunities for larger software companies  such as ibm  microsoft and oracle  to increase their market share through the acquisition of companies that dominate certain lucrative market niches or that have loyal installed customer bases 
because of oracle s acquisition of peoplesoft  we anticipate that a limited number of our customers that use peoplesoft products will choose to run these applications on oracle products rather than on our products 
continued consolidation activity could pose a significant competitive disadvantage to us 
the significant purchasing and market power of larger companies may also subject us to increased pricing pressures 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources  and a larger installed customer base than us 
in addition  our competitors advertising and marketing efforts could overshadow our own and or adversely influence customer perception of our 
table of contents products and services  and harm our business and prospects as a result 
to remain competitive  we must develop and promote new products and solutions  enhance existing products and retain competitive pricing policies  all in a timely manner 
our failure to compete successfully with new or existing competitors in these and other areas could have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate new revenues or sustain existing revenue levels 
the ability to rapidly develop and bring to market advanced products and services that are successful is crucial to maintaining our competitive position 
widespread use of the internet and fast growing market demand for mobile and wireless solutions may significantly alter the manner in which business is conducted in the future 
in light of these developments  our ability to timely meet the demand for new or enhanced products and services to support wireless and mobile business operations at competitive prices could significantly impact our ability to generate future revenues 
we acquired avantgo in  as well as xcellenet and certain assets of dejima in april  to enhance our mobile  wireless and embedded solutions that form the foundation of our unwired enterprise initiative 
in we introduced more new and enhanced products than in any previous year 
if the market for unwired solutions does not continue to develop as we anticipate  if our solutions and services do not successfully compete in the relevant markets  or our new products are not widely adopted and successful  our competitive position and our operating results could be adversely affected 
if our existing customers cancel or fail to renew their technical support agreements  or if customers do not license new or additional products on terms favorable to us  our technical support revenues could be adversely affected 
we currently derive a significant portion of our overall revenues from technical support services  which are included in service revenues 
the terms of our standard software license arrangements provide for the payment of license fees and prepayment of first year technical support fees 
support is renewable annually at the option of the end user 
we have recently been experiencing increasing pricing pressure from customers when purchasing or renewing technical support agreements and this pressure may result in our reducing support fees or in lost support fees if we refuse to reduce our pricing  either of which could result in reduced revenue 
if our existing customers cancel or fail to renew their technical support agreements  or if we are unable to generate additional support fees through the license of new products to existing or new customers  our business and future operating results could be adversely affected 
unanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
the length of our sales cycles varies significantly from product to product 
the sales cycle for some of our products can take up to months to complete 
any delay or unanticipated acceleration in the closing of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
for example  in the second quarter of  the license revenue in ipg declined from the prior year period  in part due to larger sales being delayed and a lengthening sales cycle 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control  including the size and complexity of a potential transaction  the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities and our potential customers internal budgeting process 
our sales cycle can be further extended for product sales made through third party distributors 
as a result of the lengthy sales cycle  we may expend significant efforts over a long period of time in an attempt to obtain an order  but ultimately not complete the sale  or the order ultimately received may be smaller than anticipated 
we may encounter difficulties completing or integrating our acquisitions and strategic relationships and may incur acquisition related charges that could adversely affect our operating results 
we regularly explore possible acquisitions and other strategic ventures to expand and enhance our business 
additionally  we have in the past and may in the future make strategic investments in other companies 
we have recently acquired a number of companies and formed certain strategic relationships 

table of contents for example  we acquired avantgo in and xcellenet and certain assets of dejima in april we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of complimentary or strategic business product lines  assets and technologies 
we may not achieve the desired benefits of our acquisitions and investments 
for example  we may be unable to successfully assimilate an acquired company s management team  employees or business infrastructure 
also  dedication of additional resources to execute acquisitions and handle integration tasks could temporarily divert attention from other important business 
such acquisitions could also result in costs  liabilities  or additional expenses that could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain customer  supplier or other favorable business relationships of ours  or of our acquired operations  or be able to terminate or restructure unfavorable relationships 
under statement of financial accounting standard no 
we no longer amortize goodwill but evaluate goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions at least annually for impairment 
as of december   we had approximately million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet  none of which was determined to be impaired as of that date 
goodwill impairments are based on the value of our reporting units and reporting units that previously recognized impairment charges as was the case with ffi in are prone to additional impairment charges if future revenue and expense forecasts or market conditions worsen after an impairment is recognized 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired in the future we will be required to take a non cash charge to earnings to write off impaired goodwill  which could significantly impact our net income 
with respect to our investments in other companies  we may not realize a return on our investments  or the value of our investments may decline if the businesses in which we invest are not successful 
future acquisitions may also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  restructuring charges relating to the consolidation of operations and the creation of other intangible assets that could result in amortization expense or impairment charges  any of which could adversely affect our operating results 
restructuring activities and reorganizations in our sales model may not succeed in increasing revenues and operating results 
since  we have implemented several restructuring plans in an effort to align our expense structure to our expected revenue 
as a result of these restructuring activities  we have recorded restructuring charges totaling approximately million through december  our ability to significantly reduce our current cost structure in any material respects through future restructurings may be difficult without fundamentally changing elements of our current business 
if we are unable to generate increased revenues or control our operating expenses going forward  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
our sales model has evolved significantly during the past few years to keep pace with new and developing markets and changing business environments 
if we have overestimated demand for our products and services in our target markets  or if we are unable to coordinate our sales efforts in a focused and efficient way  our business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
for example  in january  we reorganized our sales focus with the creation of the ipg  which was designed to integrate and provide synergies among our different products lines and to focus on increasing our market presence and revenue through indirect channels such as sis  oems and vars and other resellers 
in the process of this reorganization  we brought three of our former divisions  esd  ebd and bid  under a single umbrella  and reduced the number of our business divisions from five to three 
in early the ipg sales organization was restructured into two organizations  north america and international 
other organizational changes in our sales or divisional model could have a direct effect on our results of operations depending on whether and how quickly and effectively our employees and management are able to adapt to and maximize the advantages these changes are intended to create 
we cannot assure that these or other organizational changes in our sales or divisional model will result in any increase in revenues or profitability  and they could adversely affect our business 

table of contents our results of operations may depend on the compatibility of our products with other software developed by third parties 
our future results may be affected if our products cannot interoperate and perform well with software products of other companies 
certain leading applications currently are not  and may never be  interoperable with our products 
in addition  many of our principal products are designed for use with products offered by competitors 
in the future  vendors of non sybase products may become less willing to provide us with access to their products  technical information  and marketing and sales support  which could harm our business and prospects 
we are subject to risks arising from our international operations 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future 
in  revenues outside north america represented percent of our total revenues 
as a result of our international operations  we are affected by economic  regulatory and political conditions in foreign countries  including changes in it spending generally  the imposition of government controls  changes or limitations in trade protection laws  unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws  natural disasters  labor unrest  earnings expatriation restrictions  misappropriation of intellectual property  acts of terrorism and continued unrest and war in the middle east and other factors  which could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations 
our revenues outside north america could also fluctuate due to the relative immaturity of some markets  rapid growth in other markets  and organizational changes we have made to accommodate these conditions 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we experience foreign exchange translation exposure on our net assets and transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in  our net income and revenues benefited from the decline in the value of the us dollar against a number of foreign currencies  including the euro and the japanese yen 
we do not utilize foreign currency hedging contracts to smooth the impact of converting non us dollar denominated revenues into us dollars for financial reporting 
because we do not anticipate entering into currency hedges for non us dollar revenues  our future results will fluctuate based on the appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against major foreign currencies 
as of december   we had identified net assets totaling million associated with our emea operations  and million associated with our asia pacific and latin america operations 
accordingly  we may experience fluctuations in operating results as a result of translation gains and losses associated with these asset and liability values 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our and certain of our subsidiaries balance sheets  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
specifically  we enter into forward contracts with a maturity of approximately days to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure created by certain balances that are denominated in a currency other than the principal reporting currency of the entity recording the transaction 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts are intended to mitigate the gains and losses on these outstanding foreign currency transactions and we do not enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
however  our efforts to manage these risks may not be successful 
failure to adequately manage our currency exchange rate exposure could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
growing market acceptance of open source software could cause a decline in our revenues and operating margins 
growing market acceptance of open source software has presented both benefits and challenges to the commercial software industry in recent years 
open source software is made widely available by its authors and is licensed as is for a nominal fee or  in some cases  at no charge 
for example  linux is a free unix type operating system  and the source code for linux is freely available 
we have developed certain products to operate on the linux platform  which has created additional sources of revenues 

table of contents additionally  we have incorporated other types of open source software into our products  allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs 
thus far  we have encountered no unanticipated material problems arising from our use of open source software 
however  as the use of open source software becomes more widespread  certain open source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology  which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products  which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and operating margins 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  or if we infringe or are alleged to infringe a third party s intellectual property  our operating results may be adversely affected 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology 
our inability to obtain adequate copyright  patent or trade secret protection for our products in certain countries could diminish the competitive advantages we derive from our proprietary technology and may have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
in addition  as the number of software products and associated patents increase  it is possible that software developers will become subject to more frequent infringement claims 
we have in the past received claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their patents or other proprietary rights 
it is likely that such claims will be asserted in the future 
in addition  to the extent we acquire other intellectual property rights  whether directly from third parties or through acquisitions of other companies  we face the possibility that such intellectual property will be found to infringe or violate the proprietary rights of others 
for example  a trademark infringement and dilution case filed in against nen  which we acquired in april  resulted in a multi million dollar judgment against nen and an injunction against nen s use of the trade name neon 
the action was settled in september for a lesser amount as well as certain other concessions 
regardless of whether these claims have merit  they can be time consuming and expensive to defend or settle  and can harm our business and reputation 
we do not believe our products infringe any third party patents or proprietary rights  but there is no guarantee that we can avoid claims or findings of infringement in the future 
we currently license our software products to end users directly  or through a number of reseller channels including oems  vars and sis 
under our standard software license agreements  we contractually agree to indemnify our licensees against claims that our software infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
some of our products  including our core enterprise database product  incorporate intellectual property licensed from third parties or open source software 
we attempt to exclude open source software and other products for which no ip indemnity is provided by the licensor from the scope of our indemnification obligations 
however  if we fail to successfully exclude such technology from our indemnification obligations  claims that such open source or third party technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
our key personnel are critical to our business  and we cannot assure that they will remain with us 
our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel 
in recent years  we have made additions and changes to our executive management team 
for example  in august  martin j 
healy  vice president and corporate controller  retired and was replaced by jeffrey g 
ross  formerly group director of tax and accounting 
further changes involving executives and managers resulting from acquisitions  mergers and other events could increase the current rate of employee turnover  particularly in consulting  engineering and sales 
we cannot be certain that we will retain our officers and key employees 
in particular  if we are unable to hire and retain qualified technical  managerial  sales and other employees it could adversely affect our product development and sales efforts  other aspects of our operations  and our financial results 
competition for highly skilled personnel in the software industry is intense 
our financial and stock price performance relative to the companies with whom we compete for employees  and the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located  could also impact the degree of future employee turnover 

table of contents changes in accounting and legal standards could adversely affect our future operating results 
during the past several years  various accounting guidance has been issued with respect to revenue recognition rules in the software industry 
however  much of this guidance addresses software revenue recognition primarily from a conceptual level  and is silent as to specific implementation requirements 
as a consequence  we have been required to make assumptions and judgments  in certain circumstances  regarding application of the rules to transactions not addressed by the existing rules 
we believe our current business arrangements and contract terms have been properly reported under the current rules 
however  if final interpretations of  or changes to  these rules necessitate a change in our current revenue recognition practices  our results of operations  financial condition and business could be materially and adversely affected 
in october  the fasb concluded that statement r  share based payment statement r requiring companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments at fair value  will be effective for most public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  we currently account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
however  we will be required to measure and recognize the cumulative effect  if any  from the adoption of statement r beginning july  statement r likely will affect the accounting for our current employee stock option and stock purchase plans  and could have an adverse effect on our accounting for compensation expenses if we are unable to modify our plans in an appropriate or timely manner 
in addition to the changes discussed above  the us congress enacted the sarbanes oxley act of  or the soa  in july  providing for or mandating the implementation of extensive corporate governance reforms relating to public company financial reporting  internal controls  corporate ethics  and oversight of the accounting profession  among other areas 
these sec mandated rules and procedures became effective starting in the latter half of  and new rules are expected to evolve and become implemented over the next several years 
we are also subject to additional rules and regulations  including those enacted by the new york stock exchange where our common stock is traded 
compliance with existing or new rules that influence significant adjustments to our business practices and procedures could result in significant expense and may adversely affect our results of operations 
failure to comply with these rules could result in delayed financial statements and might adversely impact the price of our common stock 
the unfavorable outcome of litigation and other claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits from time to time  some of which arise in the ordinary course of our business 
adverse outcomes in some or all of such pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 
while management currently believes that resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations  the ultimate outcome of litigation and other claims noted are subject to inherent uncertainties  and management s view of these matters may change in the future 
it is possible that our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
our operations and financial results could be severely harmed by certain natural disasters 
our headquarters and some of our major customers facilities are located near major earthquake faults 
we have not been able to maintain earthquake insurance coverage at reasonable costs 
instead  we rely on self insurance and preventative safety measures 
we currently ship most of our products from our dublin  california facility near the site of our corporate headquarters 
if a major earthquake or other natural disaster occurs  disruption of operations at that facility could directly harm our ability to record revenues for such quarter 
this could  in turn  have an adverse impact on operating results 

table of contents provisions of our corporate documents have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change in control 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  stockholder rights plan and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  prohibiting the stockholders from calling stockholders meetings and prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent
