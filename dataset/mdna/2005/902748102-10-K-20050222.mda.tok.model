overview and strategy uil holdings corporation uil holdings operates in two principal lines of business utility and non utility 
the utility business consists of the electric transmission and distribution operations of the united illuminating company ui 
the non utility business consists of the operations of xcelecom  inc xcelecom and two entities  united capital investments  inc uci and united bridgeport energy  inc ube  which hold minority ownership interests in their respective investments 
the non utility businesses also included the operations of american payment systems  inc aps until the completion of its sale to checkfree corporation checkfree on june  as a result of connecticut s electric industry restructuring legislation  ui divested its ownership interests in generation facilities 
subsequently  uil holdings invested the proceeds of the sale of ui s generation facilities in non utility businesses to offset the expected reduction in utility earnings resulting from this restructuring 
some of these investments have not generated expected results due to a number of factors including the following a slow economy resulting in less construction business with lower margins for xcelecom  poor investment market conditions offsetting the value of uci s passive investments and high natural gas prices affecting the value of ube 
uil holdings overall corporate strategy is to create shareholder value by actively managing the ui and xcelecom operating businesses to maximize earnings and cash flow 
uil holdings plans to improve the value of both the utility and non utility businesses and investments through operating and strategic initiatives designed to improve results and increase value 
in particular  uil holdings plans to actively manage its costs  capitalize on synergies within the xcelecom operating segment to improve performance  and evaluate the possible restructuring or refinancing of certain of the passive investments 
the united illuminating company ui  the utility operating unit of uil holdings  is a transmission and distribution electric utility whose primary objective is to provide high quality customer service  including the reliable  cost effective delivery of electricity to its customers in the towns or cities in which it operates 
to provide reliable service  management will prudently invest in  and maintain  its transmission and distribution infrastructure 
as such  ui  together with the connecticut light and power company which also provides electric transmission and distribution service in connecticut has applied for siting approval to construct a major transmission upgrade in southwest connecticut 
ui plans to manage operating and maintenance costs to optimize return on equity  earnings and cash flow 
while revenues are expected to remain level  earnings from ui s cta component are expected to decline over time due to the planned amortization of  and resulting reduction in  ui s stranded cost rate base 
ui s investment in its transmission and distribution infrastructure may not offset the decline of the stranded cost rate base 
xcelecom  inc 
xcelecom  the non utility operating unit of uil holdings  is an electrical and mechanical contractor and voice data video design company that operates in the eastern portion of the united states 
xcelecom was built through a series of acquisitions from to xcelecom s primary objective is to continue to improve its operating performance in the markets that it serves 
xcelecom expects to improve performance  in part  by capitalizing on synergies throughout its network of subsidiaries  including best practices for safety and risk management  project management and estimation  information systems  cross sales development and cash management and banking 
through these and other initiatives  xcelecom plans to manage operating costs to maximize earnings and cash flow that will be used to meet substantially all of the operating and most contractual commitments of its business 
xcelecom has expanded its business by pursuing an aggressive acquisition program 
due to the effects of the economic downturn on xcelecom s business and a lack of desirable acquisition prospects  xcelecom has curtailed its acquisition program 
xcelecom currently does not intend to grow materially through acquisitions in the foreseeable future  however  it will continually evaluate acquisition prospects that could complement and expand its existing business platforms 
united capital investments  inc 
as a minority owner in cross sound cable company  llc cross sound  uci will continue to work to maximize the value of its investment in cross sound 
to achieve this objective  uci will support the majority owner and project developer  transenergieus ltd  in efforts to achieve permanent commercial operation of the cross sound cable 
uci is a limited partner in three investment funds  its equity participation in such funds ranges from 
two funds are venture capital funds that invest in emerging growth companies  of which one is also licensed by the us small business administration sba as a small business investment company sbic 
the third fund is also an sbic that focuses on mezzanine financing while also investing a portion of its capital in women and minority owned small businesses and businesses located in low and moderate income areas 
as a mezzanine fund  it provides growth and acquisition capital to privately held businesses committed to sustainable long term growth  its focus on more mature companies means that uci s investment is subject to somewhat less risk  and also smaller potential returns  in comparison to the venture capital funds 
united bridgeport energy  inc 
within the constraints applicable to being a minority owner of bridgeport energy  llc be  ube will continue to work to maximize the commercial value of the plant by promoting efficient operations  working to increase the installed capacity revenues  and reviewing financial data to ensure the accuracy and integrity of such information 
major influences on financial condition uil holdings corporation uil holdings financial condition and financing capability will be dependent on many factors  including the level of income and cash flow of uil holdings subsidiaries  conditions in the securities markets  economic conditions  interest rates  legislative and regulatory developments  and the ability to retain key personnel 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees could have an adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations for uil holdings and its operating subsidiaries  ui and xcelecom 
these operations depend on the continued efforts of their respective current and future executive officers  senior management and management personnel 
uil holdings cannot guarantee that any member of management at the corporate or subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time 
in an effort to enhance uil holdings ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  uil holdings continually evaluates the overall compensation packages offered to all levels of employees 
in the fourth quarter of  uil holdings board of directors approved a plan to reorganize uil holdings finance organization to reduce costs  improve process flow and better support its core utility operations 
following the sale of aps earlier in  the strategic core of uil holdings has returned to its utility operations  along with the non utility operations of xcelecom 
as a result  the accounting  treasury and corporate planning functions of ui and the holding company will be combined in an effort to gain operating efficiencies 
in connection with this reorganization  uil holdings recorded employee termination costs in the fourth quarter of amounting to million  which equated to approximately per share  after tax 
these costs are expected to be paid within the first half of on an annualized basis  this reorganization is expected to yield consolidated after tax cost savings of approximately per share  although the impact to will be somewhat lower due to the timing of employee departures 
the united illuminating company ui is an electric transmission and distribution utility whose structure and operations are significantly affected by legislation and regulation 
ui s rates and authorized return on equity are regulated by the federal energy regulation commission ferc and the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc 
legislation and regulatory decisions implementing legislation establish a framework for ui s operations 
primary factors affecting ui s financial results  in addition to legislation and regulation  are operational matters such as sales volume  major weather disturbances  ability to control expenses  and capital expenditures 
ui expects significant growth in its capital investment in transmission  and has applied for siting approval to construct a major transmission line in southwest connecticut 
legislation state legislation has significantly restructured the electric utility industry in connecticut 
the primary restructuring legislation includes public act the restructuring legislation and public act  as amended in part by public act collectively  the restructuring legislation 
since  ui s retail customers have been able to choose their electricity suppliers 
the restructuring legislation requires that ui offer a transitional standard offer rate during the period january  december  to retail customers who do not choose an alternate electric supplier 
the restructuring legislation provides for ui to recover its costs of acquiring and providing generation services  and directed the dpuc to establish each electric distribution company s transitional standard offer rates 
as part of the restructuring pursuant to the restructuring legislation  ui s distribution and transmission rates were unbundled on customers bills  which also included separate charges as of january  for a competitive transition assessment cta  generation services charge gsc  conservation and load management c lm charge  renewable energy investment rei charge  and systems benefits charge sbc 
as of january   federally mandated congestion costs  defined by the restructuring legislation to include the costs of regional standard market design  are also identified separately on customers bills 
the restructuring legislation makes other changes to the restructuring legislation  such as the imposition of renewable portfolio standards  the support of the development of renewable energy resources  and supplier of last resort service after the transitional standard offer period ends  and a requirement that any new rate case filings include a four year rate plan proposal 
the restructuring legislation provides for ui to collect a fee of kilowatt hour from transitional standard offer service customers  beginning january   as compensation for providing transitional standard offer service 
this fee is included in the amounts charged to transitional standard offer customers  and is excluded by the legislation from determinations of whether ui s rates are just and reasonable 
for  this generated approximately million in revenue 
the restructuring legislation also provides for the dpuc to establish an incentive plan for the procurement of long term contracts for transitional standard offer service that compares ui s actual average contract price to a regional average price for electricity  making adjustments as deemed appropriate by the dpuc 
if ui s price is lower than the average  the legislation provides for the plan to allocate kilowatt hour of transitional standard offer service to the distribution company 
the dpuc has not yet established an incentive plan or made any determination with respect to the incentive fee 
regulation in december  the dpuc established ui s transitional standard offer rates that became effective january   in accordance with the restructuring legislation 
during  the dpuc has continued its implementation of other provisions of the restructuring legislation 
the dpuc s decision establishing the transitional standard offer rates determined that ui s rates complied in all respects with the restructuring legislation 
the transitional standard offer rates increased the gsc charged to customers for generation services compared to the previous standard offer gsc  modified the cta for some retail rates  and provided for the collection of federally mandated congestion costs 
the gsc rate changes reflect an increase  compared to the gsc  in the cost of generation services and related market costs  as well as a reduction in the adder included in the gsc charge in excess of expected cost 
the gsc for the transitional standard offer is designed to collect all of the costs of procuring and providing transitional standard offer service 
distribution and transmission rates remain unchanged from the levels established in september on september   the dpuc had reduced ui s customer rates in ui s retail customer ratemaking rate case proceeding 
the dpuc s decision provided for a million reduction in ui s annual revenue requirements  including a million reduction to ui s customer rates a reduction  million to be applied annually for additional funding of conservation programs  million to be applied annually for accelerated amortization to reduce stranded costs  and million to be applied to a combination of uncollectibles  taxes and rate base changes 
the final rate case decision established rates on the basis of an authorized return on equity of  excluding ui s investment in transmission rate base 
the decision further provided that earnings above the authorized return would be shared to customers and to net income  with the customers share divided equally between bill reductions and an accelerated amortization of stranded costs 
the rate case decision recognizes that the revenue requirements determination for transmission  including the applicable return on equity  is within the jurisdiction of the ferc 
ui s authorized return on equity for transmission is 
on february   the dpuc issued a final decision related to ui s request for recovery of increased pension and post retirement benefits expenses 
as a result of this decision  a subsequent appeal by the office of consumer counsel occ to the connecticut superior court and a dpuc reversal of the february  decision  ui was allowed to recover approximately million  or per share  for the period from february  through june  ui ceased recovery of the increased pension and post retirement benefits expenses effective june  ui has taken substantial actions in and to mitigate the effect of these increased pension and post retirement benefits expenses and also to reduce the increases themselves through contributing million in cash to the pension plan since the docket was initially reopened in november these actions  along with better performance of pension fund investments and improved sales growth  have allowed ui to largely mitigate the effect of the increased pension and post retirement benefits expenses through the end of on june   the dpuc approved ui s request to amend its purchased power adjustment clause rate component to allow ui to apply the clause to special contract customers 
the dpuc also approved a purchased power adjustment rate of per kwh to be applied against special contract load to reflect the increased cost to serve these customers 
this decision will allow ui to recover changes in the cost to procure energy as it relates to special contract customers through the gsc 
the decision does not explicitly order the accounting for the increased costs of million related to ui s special contract customers for the period from january  through june  the day before the effective date of the final decision 
the actual costs for that period to procure power for ui s special contracts will flow through the annual cta sbc reconciliation filing for the restructuring legislation and the restructuring legislation provide that the distribution company is entitled to recover its full cost of procuring power for customers who do not choose an alternate supplier 
on december   the dpuc issued a final decision increasing the non bypassable federally mandated congestion costs nbfmcc charge ui is authorized to collect from customers 
the nbfmcc charge relates to congestion costs associated with not having adequate transmission infrastructure to move energy from the generating sources to the consumer 
because the purpose of the nbfmcc charge is for the electric distribution company to recover its actual nbfmcc costs on a pass through basis  the dpuc decision provided for a true up of nbfmcc costs and revenues on a semi annual basis and an adjustment of the associated amounts deferred for future recovery 
the charge originally established for was based upon estimates that were made in  and reflected estimated nbfmcc lower than were actually incurred 
the decision increases the nbfmcc charge from per kwh to per kwh  effective january  this increase will enable ui to recover both the forecasted ongoing nbfmcc costs and the million deficit that has resulted from the current charge being below the incurred costs 
operations in implementing the restructuring legislation  ui established a distribution division and other unbundled components for accounting purposes  to reflect other unbundled components on customer bills 
initially  the distribution division included both transmission and distribution 
ui has now separated transmission and distribution into separate divisions for accounting purposes 
changes to income and expense items related to transmission and distribution have an immediate net income and earnings per share impact  while changes to items in other unbundled utility components do not 
the other components are the cta  the sbc  the gsc  the c lm charge  and rei charge 
the cta and sbc both earned an return on the equity portion of their respective rate bases until the september  effective date of the rate case decision  and thereafter in accordance with that decision 
those returns were achieved either by accruing additional amortization expenses  or by deferring such expenses  as required to achieve the authorized return 
amortization expenses in the cta and sbc components impact earnings indirectly through changes to rate base 
the gsc  c lm and rei are essentially pass through components revenues are matched to recover costs 
except for the procurement fee in the gsc previously discussed  and a small management fee earned in the c lm component  expenses are either accrued or deferred or revenues are transferred such that there is no net income associated with these three unbundled components 
ui s cta collection recovers costs that have been reasonably incurred  or will be incurred  to meet its public service obligations and that will likely not otherwise be recoverable in a competitive market 
these stranded costs include above market long term purchased power contract obligations  regulatory asset recovery and above market investments in power plants 
subject to future regulatory changes to the cta rate  significant load growth  or to the level of amortization  cta revenues are expected to remain relatively constant  with amortization increasing over time as the earnings trend downward due to the decreasing cta rate base 
a significant amount of ui s earnings is generated by the authorized return on the equity portion of as yet unamortized stranded costs in the cta rate base 
ui s earnings per share attributable to cta for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
a significant portion of ui s cash flow from operations is also generated from those earnings and from the recovery of the cta rate base 
cash flow from operations related to cta for the years ended december   and amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
the cta rate base has declined from year to year for a number of reasons  including amortization of stranded costs  the sale of the nuclear units  and adjustments made through the annual dpuc review process 
the original rate base component of stranded costs  as of january   was million 
it has since declined to million at year end  million at year end  million at year end  million at year end  and million at year end the result is subject to dpuc review  pursuant to an annual review of ui s cta revenues and expenses  and may be adjusted in accordance with that review 
during july  the dpuc issued an order requiring that the reduction of cta rate base utilizing excess gsc revenues be discontinued pursuant to the restructuring legislation 
ui s cta earnings will decrease while  based on ui s current projections  cash flow will remain fairly constant until stranded costs are fully amortized between and  depending primarily upon the dpuc s future decisions which could affect future rates of stranded cost amortization 
the primary distribution division operational factors affecting ui s financial results are sales volume  ability to control expenses and capital expenditures 
retail electric sales volume can be significantly affected by economic conditions and weather 
the level of economic growth can be reflected in many ways job growth or workforce reductions  plant relocations into or out of ui territory  and facilities expansions or contractions  all of which can affect demand for electricity 
the weather can also have an impact on expenses  dependent on the level of work required as a result of storms or other extreme conditions 
ui s major expense components are purchased power  amortization of stranded costs  wages and benefits  depreciation  and regional network service rns transmission costs 
on october   ui entered into an agreement with pseg energy resources trade llc pseg for the supply of all of ui s transitional standard offer generation service needs  excluding requirements for special contract customers  from january  through december   the end of the transitional standard offer period 
ui continues to purchase generation services pursuant to a december  agreement with dominion energy marketing dominion to supply special contract customers through december  while purchased power expenses are a pass through expense in terms of the regulatory methodology which facilitates how customers fund these costs collected from customers in the gsc and as federally mandated congestion costs  ui is a principal in its relationships with these suppliers  and is the primary obligor in these arrangements 
the contract with pseg contains numerous financial assurances  including a guaranty from pseg s parent company  pseg power  various credit requirements  including maintaining a minimum moody s credit rating of baa or equivalent  and a letter of credit to secure performance through the initial stages of the contract 
ui is also required to maintain a minimum credit rating of baa or equivalent 
ui s current moody s credit rating is baa  which is one level above the required minimum 
prior to january   ui purchased generation services to supply standard offer service pursuant to the agreement with dominion 
ui s agreement with dominion replaced an earlier wholesale power agreement and other related agreements with enron power marketing  inc epmi 
refer to note j  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
in order to maintain and improve its electricity delivery system and to provide quality customer service  ui is required to spend a significant amount each year on capital projects in the distribution and transmission divisions 
a large portion of the funds required for capital projects is provided internally through the recovery of depreciation and from amortization of stranded costs  and the remainder must be financed externally 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources included later in this item of this form k 
ui  together with the connecticut light and power company cl p  has filed with the connecticut siting council csc an application for a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to construct a kilovolt transmission line from middletown  connecticut  to norwalk  connecticut 
this project is expected to improve the reliability of the transmission system in southwest connecticut 
the two companies are working together for permitting  and will each construct  own and operate its respective portion of the transmission line and related facilities 
ui will construct  own  and operate transmission and substation facilities comprising approximately of the total project 
ui s current estimate for its share of the project cost is approximately million excluding allowance for funds used during construction 
the csc has requested  and ui and cl p have granted  a six month extension of the date for csc s final decision to april based on the current projected schedule of construction  and barring any delays in approval by the csc  the project is expected to be completed in other governmental permitting  together with approvals from iso new england iso ne  will be required for the project 
the total project cost and timing of completion could change depending on final csc decision specifications and timing and other permit requirements 
ui s costs for the project are expected to be included in and recovered through transmission rates under ferc jurisdiction 
ui is dependent on the knowledge  training and abilities of its workforce 
retaining key employees and maintaining the ability to attract new employees are important to both ui s operational and financial performance 
a significant portion of ui s workforce  including many workers with specialized skills maintaining and servicing the electrical infrastructure  will be eligible to retire over the next five years 
such highly skilled individuals cannot be quickly replaced due to the technically complex work they perform and the time it takes to hire and train replacements 
the inability to retain or replace these employees could have an adverse effect on ui s financial condition and results of operations 
in recognition of this situation  ui has several recruiting and training initiatives underway to mitigate the expected future attrition and maintain the skill sets required to service customers 
the current agreement between ui and its unionized employees  which covers approximately of ui s workforce  expires in may the inability to enter into a new agreement could have an adverse effect on ui s operations 
risk management and insurance ui s primary risk management and insurance exposures include bodily injury  property damage  fiduciary responsibility  and injured workers compensation 
ui is insured for general liability  automobile liability  property loss  fiduciary liability and workers compensation liability 
ui s general liability and automobile liability programs provide insurance coverage for third party liability claims for bodily injury including pain and suffering and property damage  subject to a deductible 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
ui reviews the general liability reserves quarterly to ensure the adequacy of those reserves 
the reserve is based on historical claims  business events  industry averages and actuarial studies 
insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors such as claims incurred but not reported and awards greater than expected  therefore  reserve adjustments may become necessary as cases unfold 
ui insures its property subject to deductibles depending on the type of property 
ui s fiduciary liability program and workers compensation program provide insurance coverage  subject to deductibles as well 
as with other companies  ui has seen significant increases in its workers compensation premiums in the past several years 
xcelecom  inc 
the principal factors affecting the financial results of xcelecom and its subsidiaries are construction and technology spending  competition  fixed priced contract estimation and bidding  work related hazards and insurance  attracting and retaining management expertise  overall liquidity and ability to obtain surety bonding  and risks of attaining required labor productivity levels to meet or exceed contract estimates 
additional risk factors include general economic conditions  the pace of technological changes  recoverability and potential for impairment of goodwill  and collectibility of receivables 
more than half of xcelecom s business involves the installation of electrical  mechanical and integrated network information systems in newly constructed and renovated buildings and plants 
downturns in levels of construction starts and business spending can have a material adverse effect on xcelecom s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  xcelecom s business is subject to seasonal variations in operations and demand that affect the construction business  particularly in new construction 
quarterly results may also be affected by regional economic conditions 
accordingly  xcelecom s performance in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year 
the competitive bidding process for new business contracts normally intensifies during economic downturns  leading to lower profit margins and an increased potential for project cost overruns or losses 
one of xcelecom s subsidiaries serves the region affected by the hurricanes that hit the southeast during the long term impact of the hurricane damage on this market will not be known for some time 
xcelecom s contracts are generally awarded on the basis of competitive bids 
the final terms and prices of those contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer 
although contract terms vary considerably  most are made on either a fixed price or unit price basis in which xcelecom agrees to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project fixed price or for units of work performed unit price  although services are sometimes performed on a cost plus or time and materials basis 
xcelecom s most significant cost drivers are the cost of labor  including employee benefits  the cost of products and materials  and the cost of casualty insurance 
these costs may vary from the costs originally estimated 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price and unit price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits for a project differing from those originally estimated and could result in losses on projects 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
hazards related to xcelecom s industry include  but are not limited to  electrocutions  fires  mechanical failures  and transportation accidents 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment  and may result in suspension of operations 
xcelecom s third party insurance is subject to large deductibles for which reserves are established 
xcelecom believes its insurance and provisions for self insurance of deductibles are adequate to cover reasonably foreseeable losses and liabilities 
losses impacting self insurance provisions or exceeding insurance limits could impact xcelecom s operating results 
one of xcelecom s subsidiaries has been affected by the hurricanes in florida and expects recovery from insurance policies for physical premises damage and is pursuing claims for business interruption 
settlement of these claims is expected by the second quarter of the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees could have an adverse effect on xcelecom s business  financial condition and results of operations 
xcelecom s operations depend on the continued efforts of current and future executive officers  senior management and management personnel at the companies which have been acquired 
xcelecom took certain steps to mitigate the risk of loss of key personnel of acquired companies  including the use of earn out payments  promissory notes  and covenant not to compete agreements 
there is no guarantee that any member of management of xcelecom or any of its subsidiaries will continue in their capacity for any particular period of time 
billings under fixed price contracts are generally based upon achieving certain benchmarks and will only be accepted by the customer once those benchmarks have been met 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintainedfor collection issues related to accounts receivable 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including  among others  customers access to capital  customers willingness to pay  general economic conditions and the ongoing relationships with customers 
surety market conditions are currently difficult as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain large corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis  and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately one third of xcelecom s construction related business has required bonds 
while xcelecom has enjoyed a longstanding relationship with its surety  current market conditions  as well as changes in the surety s assessment of xcelecom s operating and financial risk  could cause the surety to decline to issue bonds for future projects 
if that were to occur  xcelecom could do more business that does not require bonds  post other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seek bonding capacity from other sureties 
there can be no assurance that such alternatives could be easily achieved 
accordingly  if xcelecom were to experience an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  its operating results could be adversely impacted 
xcelecom s profitability is primarily driven by labor costs 
the ability to perform contracts at acceptable margins depends on the ability to deliver substantial labor productivity 
there can be no assurance that productivity will continue at acceptable levels for a particular period of time 
any loss of productivity could adversely affect the margins on existing contracts or the ability to obtain new contracts 
historically  a significant amount of xcelecom s growth has come through acquisitions 
from july of to xcelecom s last significant acquisition in april of  xcelecom made acquisitions 
xcelecom currently does not intend to grow materially through acquisitions in the foreseeable future  however  it will continually evaluate acquisition prospects to complement and expand its existing business platforms 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
each acquisition involves a number of risks 
these risks include the diversion of management s attention from existing businesses to integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  possible adverse effects on operating results during the integration process  and possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the combination 
if future acquisitions do not perform as expected  xcelecom may be required to write off some or all of the value of any goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisitions 
financial results may also be impacted by the degree of integration of acquisitions  including the ability to achieve synergies over the network of subsidiaries 
xcelecom s revenue growth over the past several years has been generated principally through acquisitions 
in december  xcelecom acquired datanet services  inc dsi in north carolina 
this relatively small acquisition complements xcelecom s existing operations in north carolina and provides the opportunity to expand both service offerings and the geographical area served 
the acquisition of dsi is expected to add approximately million in revenues in the computer technology industry in general has begun to see the start of an improving business environment in the united states 
xcelecom s systems integration business generally experiences the positive effects of an economic rebound prior to xcelecom s other lines of business 
xcelecom sales in its computer network systems integration line of business can be dependent on demand for specific technology categories offered through particular vendor partners  and any change in demand for  or supply of  such technology or change in relationships with such partners could have a material adverse effect on xcelecom s sales if it fails to react in a timely manner to such changes or manage such relationships 
one crucial measure of performance  gross profit as a percentage of net sales  can fluctuate due to numerous factors  including changes in prices from suppliers  reductions in the amount of supplier reimbursements that are made available  changes in customer mix  the relative mix of products sold during the period  general competitive conditions  the availability of opportunistic purchases and opportunities to increase market share 
in addition  expense levels  including the costs and salaries incurred in connection with the hiring of sales and technical services personnel  are based  in part  on anticipated sales 
therefore  xcelecom may not be able to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales or margin shortfalls 
as a result of the factors mentioned above  comparisons of xcelecom s quarterly financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
cost drivers as a service business  xcelecom s cost structure is highly variable 
primary costs include labor  materials and insurance 
approximately of costs are derived from labor and related expenses 
for the years ended december   and  labor related expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively 
approximately of xcelecom s costs incurred are for materials installed on projects and equipment and other products sold to customers 
this component of the expense structure is variable based on the demand for services 
costs are generally incurred for materials once work begins on a project or a customer order is received 
materials are ordered when needed  shipped directly to the jobsite or customer facility  and installed within days 
materials consist of commodity based items such as conduit  pipe  data cabling  wire and fuses as well as specialty items such as fixtures  switchgear  switches and routers  servers and control panels 
for the years ended december   and  material and equipment expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively 
regulations xcelecom s operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations  including licensing requirements applicable to electricians  steamfitters and plumbers  building  mechanical and electrical codes  regulations relating to consumer protection  including those governing residential service agreements  and regulations relating to worker safety and protection of the environment 
xcelecom believes it has all licenses required to conduct operations and is in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of operating licenses or an inability to perform government work 
many state and local regulations governing electricians  steamfitters and plumbers require permits and licenses to be held by individuals 
in some cases  a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all employees who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license 
it is xcelecom s policy to ensure that  where possible  any permits or licenses that may be material to its operations in a particular geographic area are held by multiple xcelecom employees within that area 
risk management and insurance the primary risks in xcelecom s operations include health  bodily injury  property damage  and injured workers compensation 
xcelecom is insured for workers compensation  automobile liability  general liability and employee related health care claims  subject to large deductibles 
a general liability program provides coverage for bodily injury and property damage neither expected nor intended 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the accruals are derived from actuarial studies  known facts  historical trends and industry averages 
xcelecom believes such accruals to be adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of liability in proportion to other parties  the number of claims incurred but not reported and the effectiveness of xcelecom s safety programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation  adjustments to the reserve may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
united capital investments  inc 
uci has a interest in cross sound cable company  llc cross sound  which owns and operates a megawatt transmission line cable connecting connecticut and long island under the long island sound 
in january  the csc granted a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to construct the cable 
in the spring of the cable was installed  and after installation it was determined that several sections of the cable in new haven harbor were not buried to the depths required by the permits issued 
the authorized depth was not achieved due to the obstruction of rock ledge  sediment and other more movable types of obstruction 
in june  cross sound submitted a request for a certificate of permission to modify the existing permit and filed a new permit application with the connecticut department of environmental protection cdep seeking to operate the cable as installed in its current location through december  also in june  a connecticut legislative moratorium on installing new gas and utility lines across long island sound was enacted  which precluded the cdep from considering applications related to submarine cables under long island sound for a year 
following the august blackout that affected the northeast region of the united states  the federal department of energy doe issued an emergency order allowing immediate operation of the cross sound cable  and subsequently issued a new order for the cable to operate until all appropriate actions to prevent future power outages in the region were identified and implemented 
the cable operated pursuant to the emergency order until the order was terminated in may the cable then ceased operations for approximately seven weeks 
in june  legislation in connecticut was signed into law extending the moratorium for another year 
this legislation also allowed for a waiver of the moratorium by means of an applicant receiving unanimous approval from certain specified legislative and regulatory officials 
in june  cross sound obtained a waiver of the connecticut moratorium by means of a settlement agreement that was executed by cross sound  the cdep  the dpuc  long island power authority  long island lighting company d b a lipa lilco lipa  and northeast utilities service company  as agent for the connecticut light and power company cl p 
this allowed immediate commercial operation of the cable 
continuation of commercial operation is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions in the settlement agreement which include cross sound coming into compliance with permit conditions as directed by the cdep  lilco lipa and cl p reaching an agreement by october  for the replacement of an existing transmission line the line which is otherwise unrelated to the cross sound cable and implementing such replacement on a schedule approved by the cdep  and cross sound  cl p and lilco lipa committing a collective amount of million  of which cross sound s commitment is million  to a research and restoration fund for the long island sound to be administered jointly by the states of new york and connecticut 
on june   cross sound submitted a request for a certificate of permission to the cdep in which it sought permission to change its methods of burying the cable so as to fully achieve the currently required burial depth 
the cdep approved the request  and on june   the cross sound cable began transmitting power in accordance with the settlement agreement 
cross sound has satisfied the provisions of the settlement agreement for which it is responsible 
specifically  the remediation work required in the federal navigation channel in new haven harbor to bring the cross sound cable into compliance with the permit conditions set forth by the cdep was completed in january the remediation required consisted of achieving the originally required burial depth in those areas deemed as soft spots  meaning the obstructions which originally prevented achievement of such depth could generally be removed without the use of techniques such as blasting 
the cost of this remediation amounted to million 
the cross sound cable was brought off line for approximately hours each day during the remediation activities 
the permit conditions did not require the original burial depth to be achieved in the area where rock ledge obstruction prevented meeting the original burial depth until such time that the united states army corp of engineers is authorized to deepen the federal navigation channel in the new haven harbor 
during the third quarter of  cl p and lilco lipa reached the necessary agreements  as required by the settlement agreement  for the replacement of the existing line 
such agreements included a schedule for implementation  which has been approved by the cdep 
implementation of this replacement plan  which is not within cross sound s control  is now the final step to satisfy the provisions of the settlement agreement 
in late september  cross sound funded its million commitment to the research and restoration fund for the long island sound  as required by the settlement agreement 
cl p and lilco lipa have also funded their commitments of million each 
uci s share of the actual project cost for the cross sound cable was million as of december  uci has provided an equity contribution of million to cross sound and uil holdings loaned million  including capitalized interest  to cross sound 
in addition  two guarantees have been provided by uil holdings and uci totaling million  in support of hydro quebec s guarantees to third parties in connection with the construction of the project see notes to consolidated financial statements note j  commitments and contingencies cross sound cable company  llc  for further discussion of these guarantees 
uci will be responsible for of any additional capital needs of the project 
with the completion of all provisions of the settlement agreement for which cross sound is responsible  the loan from uil holdings may be refinanced with external project financing 
following execution of the settlement agreement  the existing contract cross sound has with the long island power authority for the entire capacity of the transmission line has been amended  subject to formal approval by the new york state comptroller  to increase the overall term of the agreement from years to years by means of adding an initial three year period at the current reduced rates  and an additional five years to the end of the contract term  at full rates 
uci s investments in the venture funds in which it holds equity interests were viewed as an opportunity to earn reasonable returns and promote local economic development 
due to the nature of its investments and market conditions  the carrying value of the zero stage vi fund has decreased substantially since the end of and in the first quarter of uci wrote down the carrying value to zero  as the liabilities of the fund are in excess of the market value of its assets 
in july  uci funded its remaining capital commitment of million to zero stage vii 
there has been no material change since december  in the carrying value of the ironbridge mezzanine fund  which is the other venture fund in which uci holds an equity interest 
united bridgeport energy  inc 
ube holds a ownership interest in bridgeport energy llc be  the owner of a gas fired mw merchant wholesale electric generating facility located in bridgeport  connecticut 
the principal factors which affect the financial condition of ube are natural gas prices  connecticut energy prices  maintenance costs and installed capability icap revenues 
as ube holds a minority interest in be  there are additional risk factors associated with the activities of the majority owner  an affiliate of duke energy 
the majority owner of be is an affiliate of duke energy 
another affiliate of duke energy owns a interest in duke energy trading and marketing detm  which is a joint venture with exxon mobil corporation 
be has an agreement through august with detm that gives detm the right to deliver natural gas to the facility and market all the electricity generated by the facility 
detm reimburses be under a formula based on the difference between gas costs and electric prices 
although routine maintenance is performed on the plant on a regular basis  from time to time the plant must be brought offline for a major overhaul 
the next major overhaul is planned for under an existing maintenance contract  the plant has begun incurring some of these costs  and they are being accrued until the outage occurs 
be had sufficient cash to fund these costs in  however  based on current estimates  be will require additional capital from the owners to cover the additional costs in when the outage occurs 
based on current projections  ube s additional capital requirement is expected to be million 
ube has provided a capital contribution of million in february ube and the majority owner plan to fund the additional capital requirements either through further capital contributions or through a secured loan to the plant on market terms 
the icap market is designed to offer an incentive to maintain availability of adequate generating capacity 
be receives icap revenues from energy marketers based on the plant s installed capacity 
the plant began initial operation with a multi year contract for icap 
since the contract ended in  be has only been able to sell its icap in the forward month market at a much lower price  reducing icap revenues by approximately to 
the ferc has directed iso ne to develop a locational icap market  with the intent to provide higher capacity payments to generators within designated congestion areas 
the ferc has delayed the decision on locational icap until june to allow more time to study the issue  with any decision expected to become effective in january the full impact of locational icap is not known at this time 
the majority owner of be has filed with the ferc an application for reliability must run rmr status  which  if approved  could significantly increase be s revenues in ube agrees with the majority owner that rmr would be beneficial to be  but objected because certain aspects of proposed related transactions between the majority owner and its affiliates  including detm  are not in the best interests of be 
therefore  in the first quarter of  ube notified the majority owner that it will pursue its contractual rights to sell its interest to the majority owner at fair market value 
the majority owner has responded to ube s notice  asserting that the contractual preconditions for such a sale have not been met 
ube and the majority owner have commenced a dispute resolution process to resolve this disagreement over the sale rights 
results at ube continue to be hampered by high natural gas prices that drive down both margins and sales volumes at be  as well as the absence of a viable capacity market to provide incentive for generating plants to remain available 
although natural gas prices have remained at elevated levels in recent years  doe annual energy outlook projections show improving conditions in the future 
in addition  rmr status and locational icap are expected to provide compensation to the plant for its availability based on these projections  no conditions were noted to give rise to an impairment with respect to the current million carrying value of ube s investment in be 
ube will continue to monitor its investment in be for recoverability  as changes in the projections considered could have a negative impact on the carrying value of the investment in the future 
as the majority owner of be  duke energy s affiliate is responsible for the daily operations and administration of the plant  including all accounting and financial reporting functions of be 
as a minority interest owner  ube relies on the financial reports provided by be to record its appropriate share of income or losses of be 
during  results at be have been negatively impacted by a number of accounting adjustments related to prior years 
the impact of these adjustments on ube s results for the year ended december  was million 
in the third quarter of  duke energy paid ube million to reimburse ube for the impact of an adjustment related to property taxes that dated back to a period in which ube was only a owner of be 
the completion of the annual independent audit of be s financial statements is still pending  and there could be additional adjustments as a result of the audit 
ube conducted an audit of be during and is discussing its findings with the majority owner 
resolution of these issues is expected in and could potentially have a favorable impact on the results of operations of ube and may reduce the amount of capital required from ube in american payment systems  inc 
as a result of the completion of the sale of aps to checkfree on june   uil holdings is no longer subject to the operating risk factors that affected the financial results of aps in prior reporting periods 
uil holdings exposure regarding aps is now governed by the indemnity provisions of the stock purchase agreement pursuant to which aps was sold to checkfree 
those provisions require uil holdings to indemnify checkfree for breaches of the representations and warranties contained in the agreement subject to certain limitations  as well as certain specified matters relating to the operations of aps prior to the sale 
liquidity and capital resources uil holdings generates its capital resources primarily through operations 
at december   uil holdings had million of unrestricted cash and temporary cash investments 
this represents an increase of million from the corresponding balance at december  the components of this increase  which are detailed in the consolidated statement of cash flows  are summarized as follows in millions balance  december  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations net cash provided by used in investing activities of continuing operations acquisition of electric system work center facility cash invested in plant changes in restricted cash deferred payments in prior acquisitions acquisition of business  net of cash acquired loan to cross sound cable project net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations financing activities  excluding dividend payments dividend payments net cash provided by discontinued operations net change in cash balance  december  as of december   uil holdings had million in restricted cash related to future debt payments of xcelecom 
the net change in uil holdings unrestricted cash position at december   as compared to december   was due to a combination of cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations  as well as the proceeds provided by discontinued operations due to the completion of the sale of aps in june cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was driven mainly by the utility business and was sufficient to cover the payment of uil holdings quarterly dividends payments totaling million  funding of million to the ui pension and post retirement plans  and various investing activities  including ui s purchase of the electric system work center facility for million in january cash provided by discontinued operations was primarily due to million of proceeds received for the sale of aps  which was utilized to payoff million in short term borrowings  to pay for million of costs associated with the sale of aps and to fund the million portion of the estimated income tax payments made in related to the gain on the sale of aps 
in the event that uil holdings were to incur capital losses during the next three years that could not be offset with current period capital gains  such losses could be carried back to for income tax purposes and applied against the aps capital gain 
this scenario would result in uil holdings receiving a refund of income taxes paid 
uil holdings also accesses capital through both long term and short term financing arrangements 
total long term debt outstanding as of december  was million  which was unchanged from year end during  moody s investors service moody s lowered uil holdings issuer rating from baa to baa through two different downgrades of one level each in the first and third quarters of  respectively 
concurrent with the uil holdings downgrades  moody s also downgraded ui s issuer rating and senior unsecured debt rating from a at the beginning of to the current rating of baa at the time of the second downgrade in the third quarter of  moody s stated that the outlook for the ratings of both uil holdings and ui is stable 
uil holdings believes the financial impact of the ratings changes is minimal  as other than the re pricing of million of pollution control revenue bonds on february   neither uil holdings nor ui expects to issue or refinance any long term debt prior to december uil holdings and xcelecom also have short term credit facilities totaling million and million  respectively 
the following table presents a summary of the amounts available under these credit facilities as of december  uil holdings xcelecom in millions credit lines available less credit line advances outstanding less credit facility supporting standby letters of credit less credit facility supporting capital equipment funding available credit all capital requirements that exceed available cash will have to be provided by external financing 
although there is no commitment to provide such financing from any source of funds  other than the short term credit facilities discussed above  future external financing needs are expected to be satisfied by the issuance of additional short term and long term debt 
the continued availability of these methods of financing will be dependent on many factors  including conditions in the securities markets  economic conditions  and future income and cash flow
