the collars  which have been designated as cash flow hedges  involve the purchase of fuel call options with the simultaneous sale of fuel put options with identical expiration dates 
as of the end of december  million has been expensed because jet fuel prices have fallen below the collars 
the collars for first quarter cover approximately of the total estimated fuel consumption at a swap rate of approximately per gallon and with an average floor price of per gallon and average ceiling price of per gallon  which includes into plane costs 
there are collars in place that cover  and of the estimated fuel consumption for second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  as of january  the company anticipates continuing to hedge future fuel purchases for as circumstances and market conditions allow 
heavy maintenance in the fourth quarter of  the company announced that heavy maintenance operations for the md aircraft would be outsourced to a third party maintenance provider beginning in early due to changes in the composition of the company s airline fleet  the company determined it is no longer economical to maintain a heavy maintenance operation in house 
outsourcing this activity will reduce costs and turn time for the aircraft

in connection with this decision  the company performed evaluations to determine  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal on long lived assets  whether probability weighted future cash flows from an asset undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amounts 
as a result of the evaluation  the company determined that the estimated probability weighted future cash flows would be less than the aggregate carrying amounts  resulting in impairment as defined by sfas no 
consequently  in first quarter  the cost bases of these assets were reduced to reflect the fair market value at the date of the decision  resulting in a million pre tax impairment loss  and the remaining depreciable lives were adjusted for the new retirement schedule 
in determining the fair market value of these assets  the company considered market trends in aircraft dispositions  data from third parties and management estimates

the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however future results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are policies that reflect material judgment and uncertainty and may result in materially different results using different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers the following as its critical accounting policies and estimates frequent flyer revenue and impairment of long lived assets 
for a detailed discussion of accounting policies  refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
frequent flyer revenue a portion of the revenue from the sale of frequent flyer mileage credits is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is likely to be provided  based on estimates of the fair value of tickets to be redeemed  straight line over months  which is the company s estimate of when travel will occur 
the estimated incremental cost of providing future transportation in conjunction with travel miles under the company s frequent flyer program is accrued based on an estimated redemption percentage of applied to actual mileage recorded in members accounts over the standard award level 
as part of estimating incremental costs  the company includes the additional costs related to transportation of passengers  over and above costs to transport vacant seats  such as fuel  meals  insurance and ticketing 
a change to these cost estimates and the estimated redemption percentage could have a significant impact on the company s liability in the period the change is made  as well as in future periods 
the ultimate cost will depend on the actual redemption of frequent flyer miles  and may be greater or less than amounts accrued at december  impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount 
the company uses judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
factors the company considers that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company is required to make estimates of its future cash flows related to the asset subject to review 
these estimates require assumptions about demand for the company s service  future market conditions and industry competition 
other assumptions include determining the discount rate and future growth rates 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company has no arrangements of the types described in any of the categories that may have a material current or future effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations

liquidity and capital resources the company s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared with million at december  at december   the restricted cash balance was million  compared with million on december  the change in restricted cash is primarily attributable to an increase in the cash holdback amount related to credit card processing agreement for mastercard visa transactions  which is discussed in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
in the third quarter of  the company did not achieve the monthly covenants stated in the mastercard visa agreement  and the credit card processor increased the holdback amount from to in december  or approximately million

the aggregate amount of the risk exposure of all the processors other than amounts under holdback as of january  was approximately million 
in addition to the holdback amount  the restricted cash balance also includes amounts for insurance and collateral for letters of credit and the fuel collar agreement 
as of december   the company had a working capital surplus of million compared with million on december  the reduction in working capital as of december  is primarily related to a decrease in unrestricted cash and an increase in air traffic liability  partially offset by an increase in inventories and restricted cash 
operating activities net cash used in operations for the year ended december  totaled million 
cash used by operations at december  primarily reflects the million net loss incurred during the year 
this was partially offset by the effects of credits used related to the acquisition of boeing aircraft 
midwest airlines has used credit memos from certain suppliers associated with the delivery of each boeing aircraft for the acquisition of aircraft spare parts and maintenance tooling  employee training  flight simulator rental  aircraft and engine lease payments  and engine maintenance agreements 
as of december   the amount of unused credit memos totaled million and is recorded as other assets 
midwest airlines will receive additional credit memos on the delivery of each subsequent boeing aircraft  and will continue to use the credits as needed to pay for applicable services 
the income statement benefit of these credit memos is being recognized over the term of the leases 
credits available for aircraft lease payments were  for the most part  used up during the first quarter of investing activities net cash provided by investing activities totaled million compared with million for the year ended december  the change primarily relates to the increase in capital expenditures in relating to the build up of spare parts and other equipment in anticipation of the introduction of the boeing program 
the change was also caused by decreases in aircraft purchase deposits and pre delivery progress payments related to future deliveries of boeing aircraft that were offset by a decrease in purchase deposits that had been returned for the six boeing deliveries in capital spending net of credits decreased year over year  totaling million for the year ended december  financing activities net cash used in financing activities during totaled million compared with net cash provided by financing activities in of million 
during  the company netted approximately million from the issuance of private placement convertible debt and equity and generated approximately million in new capital from the sale leaseback of the company headquarters facility 
there was no activity for these two items in this change was partially offset by a million increase in the net payments of debt in regard to the progress payments due to the change in timing of the boeing deliveries 
in second quarter  midwest airlines entered into a loan agreement to fund pre delivery progress payments to the boeing company for new boeing aircraft 
midwest airlines also entered into a loan agreement with kreditanstalt fur wiederaufbau bank kfw with the assistance of rolls royce deutschland ltd 
co 
kg rolls royce 
rolls royce agreed to guarantee this loan agreement on behalf of midwest airlines 
this agreement is discussed in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
as of december   the company owed million under the loan agreement 
the company expects that the debt associated with this financing transaction will continue to trend downward  as the firm aircraft delivery schedule is more than half completed 
with the kfw loan agreement and a commitment from boeing capital corporation bcc to finance the boeing aircraft  the company believes it has requisite financing for the remaining firm aircraft deliveries under the boeing program 
although bcc is able to terminate its financing commitment if it deems the company has experienced a material adverse change and the commitment is subject to other conditions  the company does not anticipate that the financing commitment will be terminated or that the company will be unable to meet the conditions 
the company maintains a qualified defined benefit plan  the pilots supplemental pension plan the qualified plan  which provides supplemental retirement benefits to midwest airlines pilots  and an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plan to provide midwest airlines pilots with annuity benefits for salary in excess of amounts permitted to be paid under the provisions of the tax law to participants in the qualified plan 
the method used to determine the market related value of plan assets is the prior year s market related value of assets  adjusted by contributions  disbursements  expected return on investments and of investment gains losses during the five prior years 
as of december   the qualified plan assets are invested primarily in equities and fixed income instruments 
additional discussion of plan investment strategy is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k

principal and interest on these basic moratorium notes are payable  in arrears  in monthly installments 
payments on the basic moratorium notes began in july for a total of million in principal payments as of december  as a result of the restructuring of lease and debt agreements  the company has significantly lowered its obligations compared with the obligations under the previous lease and debt agreements 
included in the restructured agreements are clauses that would make the company s obligations  under certain default situations  increase to the amounts under the previous agreements 
such defaults include the company filing for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the amount of such contingent obligation of the company is approximately million as of december  other factors affecting liquidity the company has not paid federal income taxes in the last three years 
as of december   the company had a non current deferred tax liability of million and deferred tax assets aggregating million 
these amounts included million related to net operating losses nols and a valuation allowance of million 
due to accumulated losses and the inability to offset net operating losses against deferred tax liabilities  the company no longer records income tax benefits effective with the second quarter of at december   the company had estimated tax nols of million for federal income tax purposes that will expire through the company had also previously recorded estimated state nols of million  as well as alternative minimum tax carryforward of million 
due to the uncertainty of realizing the nols  the company recorded an additional state valuation allowance of million and a federal valuation allowance of million in the year ended december  contractual obligations the following table of material debt and lease commitments at december   summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the future periods set forth below in thousands related cash outflows contractual obligations total and and and after long term debt obligations     operating lease obligations     capital lease obligation other long term commitments     total      note regarding the company s commitments to acquire boeing  the above table reflects  under other long term commitments  the estimated lease payments the company expects to pay after delivery of aircraft which the company has estimated based on assumptions regarding lease terms  interest rates and other factors  rather than reflecting the purchase price for the aircraft and the related obligation to make progress payments 
similarly  long term debt in the above table does not include debt for progress payments related to the acquisition of boeing aircraft 
the embraer regional jet program will require long term financing on or after delivery  which the company has not yet arranged  therefore an estimated amount has not been included in the above table 
the company s aircraft financing is discussed in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k
