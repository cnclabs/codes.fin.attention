item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and contractual obligations  as well as discussing our critical accounting policies 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other sections of this annual report on form k 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  financial condition and critical accounting policies 
executive summary buckeye technologies inc and its subsidiaries manufacture value added cellulose based specialty products in the united states  canada  germany  and brazil and sell these products in over countries worldwide 
we generate revenues  operating income and cash flows from two reporting segments specialty fibers and nonwoven materials 
specialty fibers are derived from wood and cotton cellulose materials using wetlaid technologies 
our nonwoven materials are derived from wood pulps  synthetic fibers and other materials using an airlaid process 
see item business for a more detailed description of these segments and processes 
our strategy is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading supplier of cellulose based specialty products 
we believe that we can continue to expand market share  improve profitability and decrease our exposure to cyclical downturns by pursuing the following strategic objectives focus on technically demanding niche markets  develop and commercialize innovative proprietary products  strengthen long term alliances with customers  provide our products at an attractive value  and significantly reduce our debt 
fiscal was a year of improvement and recovery for buckeye 
we made considerable progress in restoring profitability and strengthened our balance sheet 
our specialty fibers markets remained strong 
as our inventories are at historically low levels  we are carefully matching sales with production to optimize our product mix and move product into higher value niche markets 
while the nonwoven materials segment posted improvements during fiscal they are still operating in an environment of significant over supply in north america 
o net income reached million per share last year 
this compares to a loss of million per share in fiscal and a loss of million per share in fiscal o net sales for fiscal year were million  above the million achieved in fiscal and above the million achieved in fiscal o our gross margin in fiscal year reached  higher than the achieved in fiscal and the achieved in fiscal o net cash provided by operating activities totaled million 
we reduced the debt on our balance sheet by million from million to million 
the positive events in our markets were dampened by rising costs for chemicals  energy and other materials 
we expect high costs in these areas to continue pressuring our operating margins 
since demand for our specialty fibers is sufficiently strong  we believe we can implement price increases in these markets in the future 
however  we are restrained from doing this quickly due to existing commercial agreements 
in early january  we announced a plan to close our glueckstadt  germany specialty fibers facility during the second quarter of fiscal although cotton linter pulp remains an important part of the specialty fibers business  we could no longer economically justify operating this high fixed cost facility 
we expect to retain most of the volume currently produced at glueckstadt through improved utilization of our memphis  tennessee facility and bringing the americana  brazil facility  which we expect will have market capability by the fall of  to near capacity levels on an accelerated schedule 
the inability to recover the remaining value of the glueckstadt  germany assets resulted in an impairment charge of million and should result in restructuring charges and related payments of approximately million during fiscal and to accommodate demand for high end products and a smooth transition of the business currently sourced at the glueckstadt  germany facility  we added a shift to our memphis  tennessee cotton based specialty fibers facility 
we began operating this facility on a four shift schedule during march our north american airlaid nonwovens business made significant progress this fiscal year  achieving growth in revenue 
this improvement offset the closure of our cork  ireland facility  allowing us to maintain year over year shipment volumes while improving earnings 
we ceased producing airlaid nonwoven materials at our cork  ireland facility in july  and successfully transitioned the majority of the product previously produced at cork to our larger dual line plants in europe and north america 
this increased the capacity utilization at our other airlaid nonwovens facilities and  as a result  we have seen improved earnings in our nonwovens segment 
the full on going benefit of cost savings from the closure was realized during the last six months of fiscal and we expect going forward will total approximately million annually 
with our steinfurt  germany plant running at near capacity in fiscal year  we plan to focus on further improving capacity utilization in north america  where we still have excess capacity 
however  we expect the over supply situation in north america and the high costs for raw materials will continue to present challenges for the nonwoven materials segment in fiscal our cash flow during fiscal was strong 
during the year  we reduced the debt  including capital leases  on our balance sheet by million 
although we were not able to cost effectively obtain the consent of the holders of our notes due in to fully refinance our notes due in with bank debt  we elected to call a portion of our notes due in during the year  we retired million of the relatively high cost notes from the market 
we intend to call the remainder of the notes over the next several years in advance of their maturity on september  our operating margins were negatively impacted during the second half of fiscal by high costs for chemicals and energy  and extra expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley 
re establishing margin improvement is a key goal for fiscal year we are encouraged by progress on several fronts o we launched a new product  buckeye ultrafiber tm  a revolutionary concrete reinforcing fiber at the world of concrete exhibit in las vegas  nevada in january buckeye ultrafiber tm was voted the most innovative new product at the show 
as we have previously reported  we are currently establishing distribution for this product in the united states as well as in foreign markets 
all early signs continue to be positive 
o the demand for liquid crystal display screens for laptop computers and television sets continues to expand rapidly 
our cotton cellulose fibers are a small but critical component of the construction of these screens 
o our plan to transition the specialty fibers production currently supplied by glueckstadt  germany to our lower cost manufacturing facilities in memphis  tennessee and americana  brazil is proceeding on schedule 
we expect to complete our project to add full market capability to our americana  brazil facility by the end of this calendar year 
this  coupled with the additional production shift at our memphis  tennessee facility  positions us to supply cotton based specialty fiber products from facilities with a significantly more favorable cost structure during the second half of fiscal the combination of new product initiatives  strong demand in important markets and an improved manufacturing configuration gives us optimism that we can generate future growth in sales and profitability 
like other manufacturing firms  we are currently being negatively impacted by high costs for energy  chemicals  and other materials 
additionally  the extra administrative expense brought about by compliance with sarbanes oxley was and will continue to be burdensome 
these issues will slow progress in the short term  but we believe our longer term outlook continues to be favorable 
results of operations consolidated results the following table compares the components of consolidated operating income loss for the three fiscal years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  research and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles and other impairment and restructuring costs operating income loss percent change is not meaningful 
net sales continued to improve overall during fiscal due primarily to increased pricing and improved mix in both specialty fibers and nonwoven materials 
net sales growth in fiscal was due to strong performance by the nonwoven materials segment  primarily the result of increased volume and the strengthening of the euro 
the increase in nonwoven materials sales was only slightly offset by a decline in net sales of specialty fibers products during fiscal cost of goods sold increased by on an overall volume increase of approximately during fiscal this consistency was the result of two offsetting factors 
during fiscal there was a significant increase in chemical  energy and other raw material costs that impacted all of our plants 
this increase was offset by the absence of several additional specialty fibers charges related to unusual events and special circumstances  including a planned extended maintenance shutdown at our perry  florida specialty fibers facility that occurred during fiscal gross margins were positively impacted by the higher selling prices discussed previously 
the unusual events and special circumstances during fiscal also contributed to the decrease in gross margin versus fiscal these items are discussed further in the segment results section of this discussion and analysis 
selling  research and administrative expenses increased during fiscal primarily due to increased accounting and consulting fees related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley 
external costs related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley exceeded million for fiscal we expect the costs related to compliance with sarbanes oxley will decrease in fiscal this increase was partially offset by the absence of million of bad debt expense incurred during fiscal as a result of the bankruptcy filing of a large specialty fibers customer 
in arriving at our decision to close our glueckstadt  germany  cotton based specialty fibers facility  we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets at the facility and recognized an impairment charge of million in fiscal as of june   we had incurred million of restructuring costs as part of this planned closure 
the remaining restructuring costs incurred during fiscal were primarily related to the program initiated as part of the closure of our cork  ireland facility 
we experienced an operating loss in primarily as a result of million of restructuring and impairment costs related to the closure of our cork  ireland facility and other organizational restructuring 
further discussion of revenue  operating trends  impairment and restructuring costs can be found later in this md a 
additional information on the impairment and restructuring programs and charges may also be found in note  impairment of long lived assets  and note  restructuring costs  to the consolidated financial statements of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
segment results although nonwoven materials  processes  customers  distribution methods and regulatory environment are very similar to specialty fibers  we believe it is appropriate for nonwoven materials to be disclosed as a separate reporting segment from specialty fibers 
the specialty fibers segment is an aggregation of cellulosic fibers based on both wood and cotton 
we make separate financial decisions and allocate resources based on the sales and operating income of each segment 
we allocate selling  research  and administration expense to each segment  and we use the resulting operating income to measure the performance of the two segments 
we exclude items that are not included in measuring business performance  such as restructuring costs  asset impairment  amortization of intangibles and certain financing and investing costs 
specialty fibers the following table compares specialty fibers net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income net sales increased during fiscal primarily due to an increase in specialty wood shipment volume and higher selling prices for both wood and cotton based products 
improvements in volume  selling prices and mix of our specialty fibers products were driven by several complementary factors o market supply constraints caused by the closure of one of the world s largest dissolving wood cellulose mills in calendar significantly tightened the market for high purity dissolving wood pulps 
this development presented us with opportunities to increase our shipments of high purity dissolving wood pulps and to reduce our shipments of fluff pulp during fiscal and in fiscal  shipment volume for specialty pulp grades increased over the prior year 
this demand was met partially by reducing our finished goods inventory of specialty pulp grades 
strong demand and constrained supply in the market for high purity dissolving wood pulps also allowed us to raise the average prices on our specialty grades by approximately 
we are currently limited in our ability to raise specialty pulp pricing further by calendar year supply agreements with a number of our customers 
o continued strengthening of the world wide economy increased the overall demand for pulp and paper products  driving up commodity pulp prices 
fluff pulp pricing steadily increased over the last two fiscal years until they plateaued earlier this calendar year 
average fluff pulp prices increased during fiscal and during fiscal although fluff pulp pricing remains steady  current fluff pulp pricing may not continue to hold and may be negatively impacted by recent weakness in commodity pulp markets 
regardless of the rise in price of commodity pulps during the last two years  we continue to believe that over the long run we will be better served by having more of our production in high value specialty grades and a smaller exposure to the more volatile fluff pulp market 
fluff pulp shipment volume including internal shipments to our airlaid plants was down about compared to the previous year 
o even though there was a strengthening of the us dollar against the euro during the last half of fiscal  the relative overall weakness of the us dollar continues to make our products more attractive to export customers 
although the us dollar ended fiscal at approximately the same exchange rate versus the euro as it ended fiscal  the dollar was on average weaker during fiscal than it was in the previous year 
changes in exchange rates may have a material impact on the demand and selling prices of our products in the future 
o net sales for cotton based specialty fibers increased approximately due to higher selling prices 
selling prices increased by an average of in an effort to pass through higher costs of cotton fibers  chemicals  fossil fuels and freight 
although these price increases had a positive impact on revenue and operating income during fiscal  they were partially offset by a decrease in shipment volume for cotton based products 
during fiscal  net sales decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and mix changes for our cotton based products and lower unit wood volume  partially offset by improvements in selling prices and mix of wood based products 
sales price increases and decreases for cotton based products are influenced by the variability in the cost and supply of cotton fibers 
as the cost of these fibers fell during calendar year  we reduced our sales prices 
our cotton sales prices did not recover until calendar year sales volume at our americana  brazil facility  increased by in fiscal  which contributed to the mix change as the selling price of this product is significantly lower due to our tolling arrangement with the customer 
rising energy and chemical prices pushed manufacturing costs higher for fiscal while we were able to recover a portion of these costs through raising the price for our products  we expect that rising energy and chemical prices will continue to put pressure on our operating margins during fiscal the allocation of sales  research and administrative costs related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley also offset the improvement in pricing  mix  and volume during fiscal in spite of the increase in costs  operating income substantially improved during fiscal based on the strong improvement in sales and the absence of several additional charges related to unusual events and special situations that occurred during fiscal these unusual events and special situations included the planned maintenance shutdown of our perry  florida facility million  the bankruptcy of a large customer million  the ratification of a new labor agreement that included a one time retroactive payment million  and higher costs associated with reduced production at our perry  florida and memphis  tennessee specialty fibers facilities 
these additional charges related to unusual events and special situations reduced operating income for fiscal by from the same period in operating income during fiscal was also negatively impacted by currency driven manufacturing cost increases at our glueckstadt  germany cotton facility due to the weakening of the us dollar 
all of these decreases were partially offset by a more favorable specialty wood pulp sales mix  higher specialty wood pulp prices  and operating the americana  brazil facility at capacity for the entire year ending june  as mentioned previously  we continue to move forward with developing our capability to supply a wide range of products based on cotton cellulose to customers worldwide by upgrading the capability of our americana  brazil manufacturing facility 
because brazil benefits from low manufacturing costs and a large and increasing raw material supply  we expect that  when this upgrade is completed in the fall of and we fully transition to market sales  this facility will be a significant contributor to our profitability 
nonwoven materials the following table compares nonwoven materials net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income the increase in net sales during fiscal was due to improved pricing and mix  and the relative strength of the euro versus the us dollar 
although we ceased production at our cork  ireland facility in july  we continued shipping inventory from cork through november and completed the transition of a majority of cork s sales to our other nonwoven materials facilities 
our increase in net sales in fiscal was primarily due to a increase in shipment volume and the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar 
these improvements were partially offset by minor price and mix changes 
during fiscal  a competitor in north america emerged from bankruptcy protection 
under new management  they aggressively sought new business in the over supplied north american market 
although we benefited from this competitor s difficulties during the first half of fiscal  their competitive actions impacted our pricing and volume in the second half of fiscal we expect the over supply situation in north america will continue to present challenges for the nonwoven materials segment into fiscal operating income improved significantly for fiscal the improvement was primarily due to higher selling prices and the closure of our high cost cork  ireland facility 
overall  our nonwoven materials business supported similar shipment and production volume with one less manufacturing facility for the majority of the year 
our gaston  north carolina facility continued to show improvement in its operating performance compared to the prior year due to significant increases in shipment volume and the resulting improvement in capacity utilization 
these improvements were partially offset by price increases on raw materials and other manufacturing costs 
the cost of fluff pulp  bi component fibers  and binder materials increased during fiscal we expect these higher costs will continue to put pressure on operating margins in fiscal improvement in operating income in fiscal reflects the increase in sales volume 
additionally  improved waste  reliability and other cost reductions along with the favorable net impact of changes in exchange rates offset some modest selling price reductions  unfavorable changes to product mix and increases in raw material prices 
our cork facility recorded improved earnings performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense after the facility s fixed assets were impaired at the end of the third quarter 
for further discussion of this closure see note  impairment of long lived assets  and note  restructuring costs  to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment activities during the three years ended june   we entered into various restructuring programs  which resulted in restructuring and impairment charges 
in order to continue to provide both specialty fibers and nonwoven materials at attractive values  we will continue to look for ways to reduce costs and optimize our operating structure 
the following table summarizes restructuring expense by program and impairment charges for the three years ended june  following the table is an explanation of the programs and the resulting impairment charges 
for further explanation of these charges  see note  impairment of long lived assets  and note  restructuring costs  to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended june total estimated millions charges estimate impairment charges restructuring costs restructuring program restructuring program restructuring program phase restructuring program phase total restructuring costs restructuring program and impairments in january  we announced our decision to discontinue producing cotton linter pulp at our glueckstadt  germany facility 
our decision was due to a combination of factors that had increased the plant s costs to a level at which it was uneconomical to continue operations 
the most significant factor impacting cost at the site was the substantial strengthening of the euro over calendar and specialty fibers are normally priced and sold in us dollars around the world 
as a majority of glueckstadt s costs are denominated in euros  this substantial strengthening had a negative impact on glueckstadt s cost position and margin 
additionally  glueckstadt s process water  waste treatment and energy costs are more than twice the cost of these utilities at our memphis  tennessee cotton based specialty fibers facility 
faced with these difficulties  we reduced the number of employees at the facility from approximately to approximately and operated at of capacity during calendar year after careful consideration of all the options available  we decided to close the glueckstadt facility and consolidate production at our two other specialty fibers manufacturing facilities 
we expect production at glueckstadt to cease during the second quarter of fiscal we expect the closing of our glueckstadt facility and the transfer of the cotton based specialty fiber production to our memphis  tennessee and americana  brazil facilities  later this calendar year  will yield a superior cost structure and improve margins 
based on our inability to recover the remaining value of the long lived assets at the glueckstadt  germany facility  we determined that these long lived assets  with a carrying amount of million  were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million million after tax 
the closure of the glueckstadt facility will result in the termination of approximately employees  and we expect restructuring expenses related to the closure to be approximately million over fiscal and period 
we further expect payments related to this restructuring program will extend through the end of fiscal we expect this consolidation to enable us to improve our overall specialty fibers operating results by approximately million annually and to reduce working capital needs by approximately million 
in anticipation of the closure of the facility  customers increased their inventories to ensure a smooth transition as they qualified material supplied from our memphis  tennessee facility 
due to the increased demand  we were able to increase pricing and make incremental sales from inventory 
additionally  as a result of the impairment of the glueckstadt plant and equipment  there was a decrease in depreciation expense during the period 
although we are recognizing some of the benefit of the closure  we do not expect to realize the full on going benefit of the closure until calendar year restructuring program and impairments during march  our board of directors approved the discontinuation of production of nonwoven materials at our cork  ireland facility 
while the demand for nonwoven products grew at a rate in the low to mid single digits on an annualized basis  the growth in demand was not sufficient to fully utilize the existing capacity 
as such  industry participants rationalized production by idling plants and closing facilities 
due to excess production capacity around the globe  we operated cork below its productive capacity from its inception in because of its location and small size  our cost to produce at cork was higher than at our other locations 
due to these issues  we decided to close the cork facility and consolidate production at our three other nonwoven manufacturing facilities 
production at cork ceased in july closing our cork facility reduced our nonwovens capacity by about 
we continued to meet customer needs for nonwoven materials by producing these products at our facilities in delta  british columbia  canada  steinfurt  germany  and gaston county  north carolina 
this consolidation reduced working capital needs  and we began to fully realize the on going cost benefit from operating one less facility during the third quarter of fiscal the closure of the cork facility and related reorganization of the nonwoven materials segment resulted in the termination of employees and resulted in restructuring expenses totaling million 
we do not expect additional expenses related to this program 
our commitment to discontinue production represented an indicator of impairment  and subsequently we evaluated the value of the property  plant  and equipment associated with the cork facility 
we determined that these long lived assets  with a carrying amount of million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
during fiscal  we also impaired certain equipment and other capitalized costs at other facilities of million 
in late december  we completed the sale of the cork facility building for million see gain on sale of assets held for sale for further discussion 
restructuring programs phase and phase and impairments in april  we announced the discontinuation of production of cotton linter pulp at our specialty fibers lumberton  north carolina facility due to the decline in demand for cotton content paper 
we completed this partial closure in august but continue to produce cosmetic cotton products at the lumberton site 
this decision reflects a steady decline in demand in the cotton fiber paper industry  which has contracted by more than one third since the late s 
while cotton linter pulp is one of our core businesses  current demand did not economically justify operating a facility that could only produce products for paper applications 
to better meet our customers needs  we consolidated our us cotton linter pulp production at our larger memphis  tennessee and glueckstadt  germany facilities 
in conjunction with the consolidation  we initiated the first phase of a restructuring program designed to deliver cost reductions through reduced expenses across the company  the main component of which was the partial closure of our lumberton  north carolina facility 
this phase of restructuring resulted in the elimination of approximately positions within the specialty fibers segment 
the resulting increase in facility utilization enabled us to improve our operating results by approximately million annually 
this more efficient operating configuration began to reduce our cost of goods sold beginning in january this closure reduced our working capital needs by approximately million 
as part of the closure  we evaluated the ongoing value of the property  plant and equipment associated with the lumberton facility 
we determined that long lived assets property  plant and equipment with a carrying amount of million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million 
the resulting impairment charge of million was reflected in the statement of operations during fiscal during fiscal  we also impaired certain equipment and other capitalized costs at other facilities of million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a second phase of this restructuring program 
this phase of the program enabled us to improve our operating results by approximately million annually through reduced salaries  benefits  other employee related expenses and operating expenses 
as a result of this restructuring  positions were eliminated 
these positions include manufacturing  sales  product development and administrative functions throughout the organization 
net interest expense and amortization of debt costs we incurred interest expense and amortization of debt costs of million in fiscal  down million from fiscal this improvement was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during fiscal and the absence of interest costs from holding million of senior subordinated notes due and million of senior notes due concurrently for days during the first half of the fiscal these improvements were partially offset by higher average variable interest rates during fiscal see note  debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of variable interest rates 
we incurred interest expense and amortization of debt costs of million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal the consistency is the result of several offsetting factors 
lower interest rates and average debt levels during fiscal offset both the negative impact of the termination of the interest rate swap and the additional expense of holding the million of senior subordinated notes due and the million of senior notes due concurrently for days during the first half of fiscal loss on early extinguishment of debt costs on march  we used cash on hand to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due in as a result of this partial extinguishment  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expense of million during fiscal on november   we established a million senior secured credit facility 
this facility amended and restated our then existing million revolving credit facility 
we used the proceeds of the new credit facility to pay the outstanding balance on the former revolving credit facility plus transaction fees and expenses 
during fiscal  million was expensed related to the early extinguishment of the previous credit facility 
on september   we placed privately million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in the notes are unsecured obligations and rank senior to any of our subordinated debt 
the notes are guaranteed by our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are also guarantors on our senior secured indebtedness 
we used the net proceeds from the private placement to redeem our million senior subordinated notes due as a result of the extinguishment  million was expensed during fiscal these expenses included a million call premium and million related to the write off of deferred financing costs 
see note  debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the debt issuance and related extinguishment 
gain on sale of assets held for sale in july  we ceased production of nonwoven materials at our cork  ireland facility 
subsequent to the july closure of the facility  we began to actively market the building and equipment with carrying values of million and million  respectively 
in late december of  we completed the sale of the cork facility building to the port of cork company for million 
although the carrying values of these assets were based on appraisals and available market information at the time of the impairment in march of  the purchase of this building for strategic purposes by the port of cork company was not contemplated in those appraisals 
as a result of the sale and disposition of the building and equipment for net proceeds after decommissioning and other expenses of million  we recognized a net gain of million million net of tax during fiscal foreign exchange and other foreign exchange and other in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the expense in fiscal was primarily due to million of expenses related to amending our senior secured credit facility and other financing related costs 
these costs consisted primarily of legal and transaction support fees 
the amendment to the credit facility  among other things  lowered the effective interest rate on our term loan by basis points  reduced the required quarterly principal payments to million  changed the final maturity of the term loan to one lump sum payment  and changed various covenant definitions 
the improvement in fiscal was due primarily to the absence of expenses related to the settlement of a lawsuit and the negative impact of a natural gas forward contract recognized in fiscal  partially offset by lower foreign currency gains 
income taxes our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in fiscal and in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the irs completed an audit of our tax return for fiscal year with the conclusion of this audit  we released the reserve on a tax deduction we claimed relating to our investment in our former facility in cork  ireland and recorded a non cash tax benefit of million to our provision for income taxes 
excluding this benefit  our effective tax rate for would have been approximately 
the additional improvement in our effective tax rate in was the result of a number of factors including o we continue to receive benefits from the extraterritorial income exclusion 
although the dollar magnitude of the benefit declined slightly in fiscal  it had a more significant impact on the effective rate due to the absolute value of our earnings before taxes 
o the favorable foreign currency translation adjustment of million recorded on the impairment of the long lived assets at our glueckstadt facility is not taxable 
therefore  the tax benefit realized on the impairment was million greater than the statutory rate would indicate 
o we recorded a tax benefit of million resulting from a net change in our contingency reserves 
effective for transactions occurring after september   the internal revenue service enacted the extraterritorial income exclusion 
the income exclusion provides for a reduction of gross income by a percentage of qualifying foreign trade income 
in order to comply with international trade rules  the american jobs creation act of  or the jobs act  repealed the current tax treatment for extraterritorial income 
effective for transactions entered into after december   the extraterritorial income exclusion is subject to a phase out which will be completed by calendar year end for transactions during calendar years and  the income exclusion will be and of the exclusion otherwise allowed  respectively 
our extraterritorial income exclusion benefit was reduced in fiscal due to this phase out and will continue to decrease through the final phase out during fiscal in october  the jobs act was signed into law 
the jobs act provides a tax deduction for domestic manufacturers 
the deduction will be phased in during fiscal years through we are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of this deduction to our business 
the benefit from this deduction in calendar is expected to be immaterial 
in addition  the jobs act also provides a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate certain foreign earnings at an effective tax rate of 
based on our assessment of the repatriation provision  we do not plan on repatriating additional funds and will continue our current policy of permanently reinvesting all foreign earnings outside the united states 
cumulative effect of change in accounting historically  we accrued in advance expenses related to planned extended maintenance shutdowns at our perry  florida facility 
however  as of july   we changed our method of accounting from the accrue in advance method to the direct expense method 
the effect of applying the new method for the year ended june  was a decrease in net loss composed of a profit increase of million pre tax million net of tax reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change  offset by million million net of tax in additional cost of goods sold compared to what would have been expensed in fiscal under the accrue in advance methodology 
the total cost of the related planned maintenance activity performed in was million 
historically  we perform planned extended maintenance shutdowns at our perry  florida facility in two to five year intervals 
due to variability in the timing and activities associated with our planned extended maintenance shutdowns  it is difficult to predict the future costs of these activities 
see note  changes in accounting  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this change in accounting 
financial condition our financial condition improved during the current fiscal year as a result of improved earnings 
we are committed to reducing our debt  strengthening our operations and continuing to improve our profitability and cash flow 
liquidity and capitalization we have the following major sources of financing senior secured credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
our senior secured credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain various covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of june  and believe we will continue to remain in compliance 
these sources of financing are described in detail in note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements 
our total debt decreased million to million at june  from million at june  from june  to june   total debt decreased by million 
our total debt as a percentage of our total capitalization was at june  as compared to at june  and at june  on june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility 
the portion of this capacity that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility 
as of june   our liquidity  including available borrowings and cash and cash equivalents was approximately million 
management believes this is sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the business 
we believe we will continue to have positive cash flow and these borrowing conditions are not expected to impact our operating or investing activities  or our ability to service our debt obligations 
shelf registration on march   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s by its terms  the shelf registration statement allows us to issue from time to time various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock and debt securities  up to an aggregate amount of million 
we filed the registration statement to gain additional flexibility in accessing capital markets for general corporate purposes 
this s registration statement became effective on april  treasury stock our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
under this authorization  we will hold the repurchased shares as treasury stock and such shares will be available for general corporate purposes  including the funding of employee benefit and stock related plans 
in fiscal  we repurchased no shares of our common stock 
through june   we had repurchased a total of  shares under the current board authority 
cash flow while we can offer no assurances  we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with current cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures  meet operating expenses and service our debt obligations for the foreseeable future 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june   compared to million at june  and million at june  the following table provides a summary of cash flows for the three years ended june  millions operating activities net income loss noncash charges and credits  net changes in operating assets and liabilities  net 
net cash provided by operating activities investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment proceeds from sales of assets other investing activities net cash used in investing activities financing activities net borrowings payments under lines of credit proceeds from debt issuances payments on long term debt and other other financing activities  net net cash used in financing activities effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on cash net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities the million improvement in cash flows from operating activities in was primarily the result of improvements in net income in fiscal due to the overall reduction in working capital during fiscal  there was limited cash generation ability from changes in operating assets and liabilities during fiscal although the closure of our glueckstadt  germany cotton cellulose facility will improve working capital in fiscal  this improvement will be offset by the increased working capital requirements at our americana  brazil specialty fibers facility as we move away from the current tolling arrangement to the new market production at the end of calendar year we do not expect changes in operating assets and liabilities will be significant contributors to operating cash flow in fiscal the million improvement in operating cash flows during fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to a targeted decrease in inventories and decreased accounts receivable 
approximately million of the accounts receivable decrease was a permanent reduction due to a change in our cash management strategy  as we began discounting large letters of credit  enabling us to reduce our debt and interest costs 
these improvements in cash from operating activities were partially offset by lower accounts payable and the expenditures at our foley plant for a planned maintenance shutdown 
net cash used in investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment increased during fiscal versus fiscal and primarily due to expenditures related to a project to add full market capability to our americana  brazil cotton cellulose facility 
we estimate the total cost of this facility improvement to be approximately million  of which approximately million was spent in fiscal we expect the remaining million will be spent during the first six months of fiscal we previously estimated total capital expenditures for this facility enhancement to total approximately million 
the increase in this estimate is due to a number of factors  including our decision to build additional capability into the manufacturing facility and a strengthening of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar 
with the remaining capital expenditures required to complete the americana  brazil facility  we expect total capital expenditures for fiscal to approximate the level of spending in fiscal we expect to incur significant capital expenditures in the future to comply with remaining environmental obligations at our perry  florida specialty fibers facility 
based on current estimates we expect expenditures of approximately million over several years possibly beginning as early as fiscal see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we sold the cork  ireland building and equipment for net proceeds of million 
these proceeds offset the increase in capital expenditures during the year 
during fiscal  in addition to our basic capital maintenance expenditures of approximately million  we made expenditures at our foley plant for a planned maintenance shutdown and capital expenditures at our memphis  tennessee facility to provide the capability to manufacture cotton cellulose products previously manufactured at our lumberton  north carolina facility 
the low level of capital spending achieved during and was due to an overall effort to reduce capital expenditures and the lack of any major construction projects during those years 
net cash used in financing activities we used cash from operating activities to reduce the principal balances on our debt and capital leases by million during fiscal we are focused on debt reduction with a target of a debt to equity balance in our capital structure 
as part of this debt reduction strategy  in february of we called  at par  million of our high interest rate   senior subordinated notes due in subsequent to june  we initiated an additional partial call of these notes in the amount of million 
we expect to complete this transaction in september using available borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
we intend to continue to call portions of the remaining million of these notes over the next several years ahead of their maturity in the fall of these partial calls will be limited by available cash and our capacity to make restricted cash payments under our other debt instruments 
in fiscal  we restructured our debt position by refinancing debt that came due in calendar we redeemed our million senior subordinated notes due and made a permanent reduction on our revolving credit facility by issuing million of senior notes due in addition  we established a million senior secured credit facility  of which million matures in  and million matures in this facility amended our revolving credit facility due in see note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in fiscal  we used cash to repay million in debt including a million note payment to upm kymmene incurred in connection with the purchase of walkisoft

lint commitments are take or pay contracts made in the ordinary course of business that usually are less than one year in length 
the majority of other purchase commitments are take or pay contracts made in the ordinary course of business related to utilities and raw material purchases 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
less than one year references fiscal  years references fiscal and  years references fiscal and critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our critical and significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates underlying our financial statements requires the exercise of management s judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our management exercises critical judgment in the application of our accounting policies in the following areas  which significantly affect our financial condition and results of operation 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for receivables we believe we may not collect in full 
management evaluates the collectibility of accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations ie  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
historically  bad debt expense for fiscal years  and have been million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  a significant customer filed for bankruptcy protection 
as a result  we recorded an increase in our estimate for bad debts of million during fiscal deferred income taxes and other liabilities deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax law treatment of certain items 
realization of certain components of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances can be impacted by changes in tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels and are based on our judgment  estimates and assumptions regarding those future events 
in fiscal  we increased the valuation allowances recorded against certain foreign and state net operating losses by approximately million  since we believe it more likely than not that these assets will not result in a future tax benefit 
in fiscal  we utilized a million foreign net operating loss carryforward that had been fully reserved 
in fiscal  we realized a million benefit in canada and in fiscal  we realized a million benefit in germany  both due to changes in tax laws 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance through a charge to income in the period that such determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period that such determination is made 
we record our world wide tax provision based on the tax rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant managerial judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
where we believe that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes  the item is deducted in our income tax returns 
however  where treatment of an item is uncertain  tax contingency reserves are recorded based upon the expected most probable outcome taking into consideration the specific tax regulations and facts of each matter 
these reserves are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities 
we adjust these reserves when an identifiable event occurs that changes the most probable outcome 
in fiscal  the contingency reserves were reduced by million 
during fiscal  the irs completed an audit of our tax return for fiscal year with the conclusion of this audit  we released the reserve on a tax deduction we claimed relating to our investment in our former facility in cork  ireland and recorded a non cash tax benefit of million to our provision for income taxes 
we also recorded an additional tax benefit of million resulting from a net change in our contingency reserves 
depreciation we provide for depreciation on our production machinery and equipment at our cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants using the units of production depreciation method 
under this method  we calculate depreciation based on the expected total productive hours of the assets and  in any case  subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
we review our estimate of total productive hours at least annually 
if the estimated productive hours of these assets change based on changes in utilization and useful life assumptions  we adjust depreciation expense per unit of production accordingly 
we use the straight line method for determining depreciation on our other capital assets 
during fiscal  based on changes in utilization estimates  we increased depreciation expense by million 
we had no changes in estimates or assumptions during fiscal or long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for assets that are held and used  recoverability is evaluated based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of the assets are determined not be recoverable  then an impairment is recognized 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value 
estimated fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value 
during fiscal  we announced the closure of the glueckstadt  germany facility 
as a result of this change in circumstances  we estimated the fair value of the long lived assets resulting in an impairment charge of million 
based on the estimated fair values of long lived assets  we have recorded impairment charges of million  million  and million for years ended june    and  respectively 
if circumstances change  our estimated fair values may be impacted and have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations 
see note  impairment of long lived assets  of our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning impairment charges 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and  as a consequence  discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
under the guidelines of sfas  goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
unless circumstances otherwise dictate  we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets that meet certain criteria over their useful lives 
we utilize the present value of expected net cash flows to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
this present value model requires management to estimate future net cash flows  the timing of these cash flows and an appropriate discount rate or weighted average cost of capital representing the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainly of future cash flows 
the discount rate  adjusted for inflation  is based on independently calculated beta risks for a composite group of companies  our target capital mix and an estimated market risk premium 
the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows were consistent with the reporting unit s internal planning 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired 
the determination of an impairment loss is complex and requires that we make many assumptions and estimates 
if our estimates of future cash flows or the underlying assumptions and estimates change  we may need to record impairment losses in the future 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  raw material costs and the price of certain commodities used in our production processes 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures 
further  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming that certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risks discussed below should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
a discussion of our accounting policies for risk management is included in note  accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the fair value of our long term public debt is based on an average of the bid and offer prices at year end 
the fair value of the credit facility approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate 
the carrying value of other long term debt approximates fair value based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of long term debt at june  were and and at june   million and million  respectively 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates and would amount to million increase in the fair value of long term debt 
we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding at june  at this borrowing level  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have a million unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows 
the primary interest rate exposures on floating rate debt are with respect to european interbank rates and us prime rates 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
buckeye and our subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and costs and their translation into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed include the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not generally hedge these net investments 
however  we use capital structuring techniques to manage our net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is and million at june  and  respectively 
the potential foreign currency translation loss from investment in foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately million at june  this change would be reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the primary foreign currency exposures on our long term investments are with the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
cost of raw materials amounts paid by us for wood  cotton fiber and fluff pulp represent the largest component of our variable costs of production 
the availability and cost of these materials are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors beyond our control  including weather conditions 
significant decreases in availability or increases in the cost of wood or cotton fiber to the extent not reflected in prices for our products  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
commodities we are dependent on commodities in our production process 
natural gas  electricity  fuel oil  caustic and other chemicals are just some of the commodities that our processes rely upon 
exposure to these commodities can have a significant impact on our operating performance 
in order to minimize market exposure  we use forward contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases of natural gas over a period of generally less than one year 
there were no natural gas contracts outstanding at june  or requiring fair value treatment 
exposure to commodity products also creates volatility in pricing 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp and other commodity products  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
industry cyclicality the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose based products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
it is not certain that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may thus fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingencies our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with such requirements 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
given the uncertainties associated with predicting the scope of future requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not in the future incur material environmental compliance costs or liabilities
