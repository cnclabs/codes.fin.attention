item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the principal business of imax corporation together with its wholly owned subsidiaries the company is the design  manufacture  sale and lease of projection systems for large format theaters including commercial theaters  museums and science centers  and destination entertainment sites 
in addition  the company designs and manufactures high end sound systems and produces and distributes large format films 
at december   there were imax theaters operating in countries 
the company derives revenue principally from long term theater system lease and sale agreements  maintenance agreements  and film distribution and production agreements 
the company also derives revenue from the operation of its own theaters  camera rentals and post production services 
important factors that the company s ceos use in assessing the company s business and prospects include the signing of new theater systems  profits from the company s operating segments  earnings from operations as adjusted for unusual items that the company views as non recurring  such as costs associated with the repurchase and refinancing of the company s senior notes due the old senior notes  and the success of strategic initiatives such as the securing of new film projects  particularly imax dmr and imax d film projects 
theater systems the company provides its theater systems to customers on a long term lease basis  typically with initial lease terms of to years 
lease agreements typically provide for three major sources of revenue initial rental fees  ongoing rental payments  which include annual contractual minimum payments  and maintenance fees 
the initial rental fees vary depending on the type of system and location and generally are paid to the company in installments commencing upon the signing of the agreement 
ongoing rental payments are paid monthly over the term of the contract  commencing after system installation and are generally equal to the greater of a fixed minimum amount per annum and a percentage of box office receipts 
ongoing rental payments include rental income and finance income 
an annual maintenance fee is generally payable commencing after the first year 
both minimum rental payments and maintenance fees are typically indexed to the local consumer price index 
revenue on theater system leases and sales are recognized at a different time than when cash is collected 
see significant accounting policies below for further discussion on the company s revenue recognition policies 
in addition  the company sells theater systems to customers 
these sales generally provide for upfront cash payments received prior to installation and the receipt of minimum payments over time  typically to years 
cash received from initial rental fees in advance of installation is recorded as deferred revenue 
the associated costs of manufacturing the theater system are recorded as inventory 
at the time of installation  the deferred revenue is recognized in income  and the inventory costs are fully expensed 
the timing of installation of the theater system is largely dependent on the timing of the construction of the customer s theater 
therefore  while revenue for theater systems is generally predictable on a long term basis  it can vary substantially from year to year or quarter to quarter depending on the timing of installation 
as at december   there were installed d flat screen systems  installed d dome screen systems  installed d standard systems  installed d sr systems and installed mpx systems in the world

page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d theater systems cont d although almost of installed imax theater bases are located outside of north america and more than of imax theater systems in backlog are scheduled to be installed outside of north america  the north american commercial exhibitor market represents an important customer base for the company in terms of both collections under existing long term leases and potential future system contracts 
in and  many of the north american commercial exhibitor chains faced financial difficulties due to over expansion  which in some cases led to bankruptcy proceedings and or consolidations the company believes it has adequately minimized its exposure to these exhibitors 
in  the company launched a new large format theater system designed specifically for use in multiplex theaters  the imax mpx projection system  which can be installed as part of a newly constructed multiplex or as a retrofit to existing commercial multiplex auditoriums  and is designed to improve a multiplex owner s financial returns through lower operating and capital costs 
many north american exhibitors have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings or consolidations with new capital raised often in public markets 
along with numerous international and regional operators  the company has targeted these north american operators for the sale and lease of its imax mpx systems 
since the product s introduction  the company has signed agreements for imax mpx theater systems of which ten were signed with north american exhibitors 
seven of the imax mpx systems were installed in three existing customers have also switched their backlog commitments to the imax mpx projection systems in the year 
while the company is pleased with the positive developments in the north american commercial exhibitor market  there is no assurance that they will continue or that other commercial exhibitors will not encounter additional financial difficulties 
to minimize the company s credit risk in this area  the company retains title to underlying theater systems leased  registers theater systems sold as collateral  performs initial and ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and makes ongoing provisions for its estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts 
the average initial rent or sales price and minimum payments earned from customers under the company s theater system lease or sales agreements can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year based on a number of factors including the mix of systems sold or leased  the type of contract and other factors specific to individual contracts  although the typical rent or sales price for its various projection systems does not generally vary significantly from region to region 
the company has taken steps in recent years to accelerate the growth of the global imax theater network and the sale or lease of its products by developing a lower cost projection system designed to appeal to broader customer bases  particularly in commercial multiplex markets 
although this system is lower cost  the company has endeavored to successfully maintain its per unit margins on a percentage basis and to maintain the aggregate revenues and gross margins through increased volume 
the company signed theater system agreements in  
sales backlog during the year ended december   the company signed contracts for imax theaters  valued at million 
at december   the sales backlog  which represented contracts for theater systems  totaled million 
the company believes that the contractual obligations for system installations that are listed in sales backlog are valid and binding commitments 
the sales backlog will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the signing of new theater systems  which adds to backlog  and the installation of theater systems and the settlement of theater system contracts  both of which reduce backlog 
sales backlog typically represents the minimum revenue under signed theater system sale and lease agreements that the company believes will be recognized as revenue as the associated theater systems are installed 
sales backlog includes initial fees along with the present value of contractual minimums due over the lease term  but excludes maintenance revenues as well as rents in excess of contractual minimums that might be received in the future 
the minimum revenue comprises the upfront payments plus the present value of the minimum payments due under sales type lease and sale agreements 
operating leases are assigned no value in the sales backlog 
the value of sales backlog does not include revenue from theaters in which the company has an equity interest  letters of intent or long term conditional theater commitments 
the company s backlog can be segregated by both territory of future installation and by customer type 
the percentage of backlog relevant to each territory based on installed dollar value of anticipated systems revenue as at december  is as follows europe  asia  north america  south america  and rest of world 
in addition  of backlog represents future installations to commercial theater customers and to institutional customers 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d sales backlog cont d the company estimates that to of the theater systems currently in backlog will be recognized subsequent to the company reached agreements for the sale or lease of projection systems in of which were for imax mpx theater systems 
shorter install cycles are likely to occur more frequently with the introduction of the imax mpx theater system  which requires less construction time as little as months due to its design and retrofit capability 
the components of the company s backlog as at december  by product type has been disclosed on page in the normal course of its business the company each year will have customers who  for a number of reasons including the inability to obtain certain consents  approvals or financing  are unable to proceed with theater construction 
once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation  the lease agreement with the customer is generally terminated or amended 
if the agreement is terminated  upon the company and the customer being released from all their future obligations under the agreement  the initial lease cash payments that the customer previously made to the company are recognized as revenue 
film production and distribution the company recognizes revenue from licensing of exhibition rights to motion pictures produced or distributed by the company when the film is complete and has been delivered  the license period has begun  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
where the license fees are based on a share of the customer s revenue  and all other revenue recognition criteria are met  the company recognizes revenue as the customer exhibits the film 
costs of producing films and acquiring film distribution rights are capitalized and amortized using the individual film forecast computation method  which amortizes film costs and accrues participation costs in the same ratio that current period actual revenue bears to estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
all advertising  exploitation costs and marketing costs are expensed as incurred 
the company has developed a proprietary  patent pending technology to digitally re master mm live action films into format film at a modest cost for exhibition in imax theaters 
this system  known as imax dmr  digitally enhances the image resolution quality of mm motion picture films for projection on imax screens while maintaining the visual clarity and sound quality for which the imax experience is known 
the company believes that this technology has opened the imax theater network up to potential releases of hollywood films including both library titles and contemporaneous new releases 
the company believes that the development of this new technology is key to helping it execute on its strategy of growing its commercial theater network by its establishment of a new distribution platform for hollywood films 
while the company is optimistic about the success of its imax dmr technology to date  there is no guarantee that it will continue to be commercially successful and receive widespread acceptance by film studios 
theater operations the company has seven owned and operated theaters 
in addition  the company has entered into commercial arrangements with two theaters resulting in the sharing of profits and losses 
the company also provides management services to two theaters 
international operations a significant portion of the company s sales are made to customers located outside the united states and canada 
during  and   and respectively  of the company s revenue was derived outside the united states and canada 
the company expects that international operations will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenue in the future 
in order to minimize exposure to exchange rate risk  the company prices theater systems the largest component of revenue in us dollars except in canada  japan and parts of europe where they may be priced in local currency 
annual minimum rental payments and maintenance fees follow a similar currency policy 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d significant accounting policies the company reports its results under both united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
the financial statements and results referred to herein are reported under us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  net investment in leases  inventories  fixed and film assets  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  future expectations and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of its audited financial statements in item the company considers the following critical accounting policies to have the most significant effect on its estimates  assumptions and judgments revenue recognition sales and sales type leases of theater systems theater system leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to customers are classified as sales type leases as a result of meeting the criteria established by fasb statement of financial accounting standards no

when revenue is recognized  the initial rental fees due under the contract  along with the present value of minimum ongoing rental payments  are recorded as revenues for the period  and the related theater system costs including installation expenses are recorded as cost of goods and services 
additional ongoing rentals in excess of minimums are recognized in future periods as revenue when reported by the theater operator  provided that collection is reasonably assured 
maintenance revenues are recognized when the services are rendered 
the company recognizes revenues from sales and sales type leases generally upon installation of the theater system 
revenue associated with a sale or sales type lease is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the timing of installation of the theater system is largely dependent on the timing of the construction of the customer s theater 
therefore  while revenue for theater systems is generally predictable on a long term basis  it can vary from quarter to quarter or year to year depending on the timing of installation 
the critical estimates that the company considers with respect to the company s lease accounting are the determination of economic useful life and the fair value of the projection equipment  including its residual value 
these estimates are based upon historical experience with all our projection systems 
residual values are established at lease inception using estimates of fair value at the end of the lease term with consideration for forecasted supply and demand for various systems  future product launch plans  end of lease customer behavior  refurbishment strategies and changes in technology 
the company monitors the performance of the theaters to which it has leased equipment 
when facts and circumstances indicate that it may need to change the terms of a lease  which had previously been recorded as a sales type lease  the company evaluates the likely outcome of such negotiations using the criteria under fas a provision is recorded against the net investment in leases if the company believes that it is probable that the negotiation will result in a reduction in the minimum lease payments such that the lease will be reclassified as an operating lease 
the provision is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the net investment in lease over the fair value of the equipment 
any adjustments which result from a change in classification from a sales type lease to an operating lease are reported as a charge to income during the period the change occurs 
in the normal course of its business  the company will from time to time determine that a provision it had previously taken against the net investment in leases in connection with a customer s lease agreement should be reversed due to a change in the circumstances that led to the original provision 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d significant accounting policies cont d revenue recognition cont d sales type leases of theater systems cont d the company generally enters into multi year system lease agreements with customers that typically contain customer payment obligations prior to the scheduled installation of the system 
during the period of time between lease signing and system installation  certain customers each year generally are unable  or elect not  to proceed with system installation for a number of reasons including business considerations  or the inability to obtain certain consents  approvals or financing 
once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation  the customer and the company may enter into a consensual lease buyout  whereby the parties are released from all their future obligations under the lease  the initial lease payments that the customer previously made to the company are recognized as revenue and the geographic territory granted to the customer reverts to the company 
in addition  since the introduction of its new imax mpx theater system in  the company has agreed with several customers to modify their lease agreements to substitute mpx systems for the systems for which the customers previously contracted  which were in the company s backlog 
operating leases of theater systems leases that do not transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the customer are classified as operating leases 
for these leases  initial rental fees and minimum lease payments are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term 
additional rentals in excess of minimum annual amounts are recognized as revenue when reported by theater operators  provided that collection is reasonably assured 
multiple element arrangements on occasion  the company will include film licenses or other specified elements as part of system sales or lease agreements 
when separate prices are listed in a multiple element arrangement  these prices may not be indicative of the fair values of those elements because the prices of the different components of the arrangements may be modified through negotiation although the aggregate consideration may not 
revenues under these arrangements are allocated based upon the estimated relative fair values of each element 
in the normal course of its business  the company will have customers who  for a number of reasons are unable to proceed with theater construction or wish to modify the terms of an existing arrangement 
there is typically deferred revenue involved with these arrangements representing initial cash payments in advance of the default  settlement or modification of the arrangement 
pursuant to the policies discussed above  the total consideration to be received in these situations is allocated to each individual element of the settlement or modification arrangement based on the relative fair values of each element 
upon allocation of value to each element  each element is accounted for based on applicable revenue recognition criteria 
accounts receivable and financing receivables the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and provision against the financing receivables are based on the company s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances and the underlying asset value of the equipment under lease where applicable 
if there is a deterioration in a customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults under the terms of the leases are higher than the company s historical experience  the company s estimates of recoverability for these assets could be adversely affected 
the evaluation of collectibility of customer accounts is typically done on an individual account basis 
if  based on an evaluation of accounts  the company concludes that it is probable that the customer will not be able to pay all amounts due  the company estimates the expected loss 
in developing the estimates for an allowance  the company considers general and industry economic and market conditions as well as other credit information available for the customer 
the company only records recoveries of provisions when objective verifiable evidence supports the change in the original provision 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d significant accounting policies cont d inventories in establishing the appropriate provisions for theater systems inventory  management must make estimates of future events and conditions including the anticipated installation dates for the current backlog of theater system contracts  potential future signings  general economic conditions  technology factors  growth prospects within the customers ultimate marketplace and the market acceptance of the company s current and pending projection systems and film library 
if management estimates of these events and conditions prove to be incorrect  it could result in inventory losses in excess of the provisions determined to be adequate as at the balance sheet date 
film assets estimates of ultimate revenues are prepared on a title by title basis and reviewed regularly by management and revised where necessary to reflect the most current information 
ultimate revenue for films includes estimates of revenues over a period not to exceed years following the date of initial release 
goodwill the company performs an impairment test on at least an annual basis and additionally  whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flows approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
any impairment loss would be expensed in the statement of operations 
fixed assets management reviews the carrying values of its fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
in performing its review for recoverability  management estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of impairment losses is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
if the actual future cash flows are less than the company s estimates  future earnings could be adversely affected 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this standard requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently amortized over the asset s useful life

the company s management assesses realization of these net deferred income tax assets based on all available evidence and has concluded that it is more likely than not that these net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
positive evidence includes  but is not limited to  the company s historical earnings  projected future earnings  contracted sales backlog at december   and the ability to realize certain deferred income tax assets through loss and tax credit carryback strategies 
if and when the company s operations in some jurisdictions were to reach a requisite level of profitability or where the company s future profitability estimates increase due to changes in positive evidence  the company would reduce all or a portion of the applicable valuation allowance in the period when such determination is made 
this would result in an increase to reported earnings and a decrease to the company s effective tax rate in such period 
however  if the company s projected future earnings do not materialize  or if the company operates at a loss in certain jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in actual effective tax rates or time period within which the company s underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  the company could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of the company s deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase to the company s effective tax rate for the period of the change and a material adverse impact on its operating results for the period 
the company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  the company may incur additional tax expense based upon the outcomes of such matters 
in addition  when applicable  the company adjusts tax expense to reflect both favorable and unfavorable examination results
