item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information  you should read the notes to the financial statements included in this report 
overview crosstex energy  inc is a delaware corporation formed on april  to engage through its subsidiaries in the gathering  transmission  treating  processing and marketing of natural gas 
on july   we formed crosstex energy  lp  a delaware limited partnership  to acquire indirectly substantially all of the assets  liabilities and operations of its predecessor  crosstex energy services  ltd 
our assets consist almost exclusively of partnership interests in crosstex energy  lp  a publicly traded limited partnership engaged in the gathering  transmission  treating  processing and marketing of natural gas 
these partnership interests consist of i  common units and  subordinated units  representing approximately of the limited partner interests in crosstex energy  lp and ii ownership interest in crosstex energy gp  lp  the general partner of crosstex energy  lp  which owns a general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in crosstex energy  lp our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own 
the partnership is required by its partnership agreement to distribute all its cash on hand at 
table of contents the end of each quarter  less reserves established by its general partner in its sole discretion to provide for the proper conduct of the partnership s business or to provide for future distributions 
the incentive distribution rights entitle us to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributed by the partnership as certain target distribution levels are reached 
specifically  they entitle us to receive of all cash distributed in a quarter after each unit has received for that quarter  of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter  and of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter 
distributions by the partnership have increased from per unit for the quarter ended march  its first full quarter of operation after its initial public offering  to per unit for the quarter ended december  as a result  our distributions from the partnership pursuant to our ownership of our  common and subordinated units have increased from  per quarter to  per quarter  our distributions pursuant to our general partner interest has increased from  to  and our distributions pursuant to our incentive distribution rights have increased from nothing to  per quarter 
as a result  we have increased our dividend from per share for the quarter ended march  the first dividend payout after our initial public offering to per share for the quarter ended december  since we control the general partner interest in the partnership  we reflect our ownership interest in the partnership on a consolidated basis  which means that our financial results are combined with the partnership s financial results and the results of our other subsidiaries 
the interest owned by non controlling partners share of income is reflected as an expense in our results of operations 
we have no separate operating activities apart from those conducted by the partnership  and our cash flows consist almost exclusively of distributions from the partnership on the partnership interests we own 
our consolidated results of operations are derived from the results of operations of the partnership and also include our gains on the issuance of units in the partnership  deferred taxes  interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income  interest income expense and general and administrative expenses not reflected in the partnership s results of operation 
accordingly  the discussion of our financial position and results of operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations primarily reflects the operating activities and results of operations of the partnership 
the partnership has two industry segments  midstream and treating  with a geographic focus along the gulf coast of the united states 
the partnership s midstream division focuses on the gathering  processing  transmission and marketing of natural gas  as well as providing certain producer services  while the treating division focuses on the removal of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from natural gas to meet pipeline quality specifications 
for the year ended december   of our gross margin was generated in the midstream division  with the balance in the treating division 
celp focuses on gross margin to manage its business because its business is generally to purchase and resell gas for a margin  or to gather  process  transport  market or treat gas for a fee 
celp buys and sells most of its gas at a fixed relationship to the relevant index price so margins are not significantly affected by changes in gas prices 
as explained under commodity price risk below  it enters into financial instruments to reduce volatility in gross margin due to price fluctuations 
since the partnership s formation  it has grown significantly as a result of construction and acquisition of gathering and transmission pipelines and treating and processing plants 
from january  through december   it has invested over million to develop or acquire new assets 
the purchased assets were acquired from numerous sellers at different periods and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations for such acquisitions are included in our financial statements only from the applicable date of the acquisition 
as a consequence  the historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable 
the partnership s results of operations are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas gathered  transported  purchased and sold through its pipeline systems  processed at its processing facilities or treated at 
table of contents its treating plants as well as fees earned from recovering carbon dioxide and natural gas liquids at a non operated processing plant 
it generates revenues from five primary sources purchasing and reselling or transporting natural gas on the pipeline systems it owns  processing natural gas at its processing plants  treating natural gas at its treating plants  recovering carbon dioxide and natural gas liquids at a non operated processing plant  and providing producer services 
the bulk of the partnership s operating profits are derived from the margins it realizes for purchasing and reselling natural gas through its pipeline systems 
generally  the partnership buys gas from a producer  plant tailgate  or transporter at either a fixed discount to a market index or a percentage of the market index 
the partnership then transports and resells the gas 
the resale price is based on the same index price at which the gas was purchased  and  if the partnership is to be profitable  at a smaller discount or larger premium to the index than it was purchased 
the partnership attempts to execute all purchases and sales substantially concurrently  or it enters into a future delivery obligation  thereby establishing the basis for the margin we will receive for each natural gas transaction 
the partnership s gathering and transportation margins related to a percentage of the index price can be adversely affected by declines in the price of natural gas 
see commodity price risk below for a discussion of how it manages its business to reduce the impact of price volatility 
the partnership generates producer services revenues through the purchase and resale of natural gas 
the partnership currently purchases for resale volumes of natural gas that do not move through its gathering  processing or transmission assets from over independent producers 
the partnership engages in such activities on more than interstate and intrastate pipelines with a major emphasis on gulf coast pipelines 
the partnership focuses on supply aggregation transactions in which it either purchases and resells gas and thereby eliminates the need of the producer to engage in the marketing activities typically handled by in house marketing or supply departments of larger companies  or act as agent for the producer 
the partnership generates treating revenues under three arrangements a volumetric fee based on the amount of gas treated  which accounted for approximately and of the operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively  a fixed fee for operating the plant for a certain period  which accounted for approximately and of the operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively  or a fee arrangement in which the producer operates the plant  which accounted for approximately and of the operating income in the treating division for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses are costs directly associated with the operations of a particular asset 
among the most significant of these costs are those associated with direct labor and supervision and associated transportation and communication costs  property insurance  ad valorem taxes  repair and maintenance expenses  measurement and utilities 
these costs are normally fairly stable across broad volume ranges  and therefore  do not normally decrease or increase significantly in the short term with decreases or increases in the volume of gas moved through the asset 
we modified certain terms of certain outstanding options on our common stock in the first quarter of which allowed the option holders to elect to be paid in cash for the modified options based on the fair value of the options 
these modifications resulted in variable award accounting for the modified options until the option holders elected to cash out the options or the election to cash out the options lapsed 
we were responsible for paying the intrinsic value of the options for the holders who elected to cash out their options 

table of contents december  was the last valuation date that a holder of modified options could elect the cash out alternative 
accordingly  effective january   we ceased applying variable accounting for the remaining modified options 
we recognized total compensation expense of approximately million related to these modified options in the partnership has grown significantly through asset purchases in recent years  which creates many of the major differences when comparing operating results from one period to another 
the most significant asset purchases since january   are the acquisitions of the vanderbilt system  defs assets  and lig assets 
the partnership acquired the vanderbilt system in december for a purchase price of million 
the vanderbilt system consists of approximately miles of gathering lines in the same approximate geographic area as the gulf coast system 
at the time of its acquisition  it was transporting approximately  mmbtu of gas per day 
the partnership acquired the duke energy field services assets  or defs assets  in june for million in cash 
the principal assets acquired were the mississippi pipeline system  a mile natural gas gathering and transmission system in south central mississippi that serves utility and industrial customers  and a non operating interest in the seminole gas processing plant  which provides carbon dioxide separation and sulfur removal services for several major oil companies in west texas 
the acquisition provided celp with a new core area for growth in south central mississippi  expanded its presence in west texas and enabled it to enter the business of carbon dioxide separation 
in april the partnership acquired lig pipeline company and its subsidiaries collectively  lig from a subsidiary of american electric power aep for million in cash 
the principal assets acquired consist of approximately  miles of gas gathering and transmission systems located in parishes extending from northwest and north central louisiana through the center of the state to the south and southeast louisiana and five processing plants  three of which are currently idle  that straddle the pipeline in three locations and have a total processing capability of  mmbtu d 
the system has a throughput capacity of  mmbtu d and average throughput at the time of our acquisition was approximately  mmbtu d 
customers include power plants  municipal gas systems  and industrial markets located principally in the industrial corridor between new orleans and baton rouge 
the lig system is connected to several interconnected pipelines and the jefferson island storage facility providing access to additional system supply 
the lig acquisition was financed through borrowings under the bank credit facility 
other assets 
we own two inactive gas plants and a receivable associated with the enron corp 
bankruptcy in addition to our limited and general partner interests in the partnership 
the two gas plants are the jonesville processing plant  which had been largely inactive since the beginning of  and the clarkson plant  acquired shortly before the partnership s initial public offering 
in the third quarter of  we fully impaired our investment in the jonesville plant 
impact of federal income taxes 
crosstex energy  inc is a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
as such  our federal taxable income is subject to tax at a maximum rate of under current law 
we expect to have significant amounts of taxable income allocated to us as a result of our investment in the partnership units particularly because of remedial allocations that will be made among the unitholders and because of the general partner s incentive distribution rights  which we will benefit from as the sole owner of the general partner 
taxable income allocated to us by the partnership will increase over the years as the ratio of income to distributions increases for all of the unitholders 
we currently have a net operating loss carryforward  and estimate that we will generate a net operating loss in fiscal we estimate that our net operating loss carryforward and our share of deductions related to the exercise of our stock options prior to their expiration in will offset most of the income that will be allocated to us in fiscal by the partnership 
in years after  however  we do not expect to have this net operating loss carryforward to offset our income 
as a result  we will have to pay tax on our federal taxable income at a maximum rate of under current law 
thus  the amount of money available to make cash distributions to our stock holders will decrease markedly after we use all of our net operating loss carryforward 

table of contents our use of this net operating loss carryforward will be limited if there is a greater than change in our stock ownership over a three year period 
however  we do not expect such a change in ownership to limit our utilization of carryforwards prior to their year expiration period 
commodity price risk the partnership s profitability has been and will continue to be affected by volatility in prevailing ngl product and natural gas prices 
changes in the prices of ngl products can correlate closely with changes in the price of crude oil 
ngl product and natural gas prices have been subject to significant volatility in recent years in response to changes in the supply and demand for ngl products and natural gas market uncertainty 
profitability under the partnership s gas processing contracts is impacted by the margin between ngl sales prices and the cost of natural gas and may be negatively affected by decreases in ngl prices or increases in natural gas prices 
changes in natural gas prices impact our profitability since the purchase price of a portion of the gas the partnership buys is based on a percentage of a particular natural gas price index for a period  while the gas is resold at a fixed dollar relationship to the same index 
therefore  during periods of low gas prices  these contracts can be less profitable than during periods of higher gas prices 
however  on most of the gas we buy and sell  margins are not affected by such changes because the gas is bought and sold at a fixed relationship to the relevant index 
therefore  while changes in the price of gas can have very large impacts on revenues and cost of revenues  the changes are equal and offsetting 
set forth in the table below is the volume of the natural gas purchased and sold at a fixed discount or premium to the index price and at a percentage discount or premium to the index price for the partnership s principal gathering and transmission systems and for its producer services business for the year ended december  year ended december  gas purchased gas sold fixed amount percentage of fixed amount percentage of asset or business to index index to index index in thousands of mmbtus gulf coast system ccng transmission system gregory gathering system vanderbilt system conroe system arkoma gathering system mississippi system lig system producer services gas sold is less than gas purchased due to production of natural gas liquids 
these volumes are not reflected in revenues or purchased gas cost  but are presented net as a component of profit loss on energy trading activities 
the partnership estimates that  due to the gas that it purchases at a percentage of index price  for each per mmbtu increase or decrease in the price of natural gas  its gross margins increase or decrease by approximately million on an annual basis before consideration of the hedges discussed below 
as of 
table of contents december   it has hedged approximately of its exposure to such fluctuations in natural gas prices as follows for future periods weighted average volume hedged price per period mmbtu per month mmbtu first quarter of second quarter of third quarter of fourth quarter of the partnership expects to continue to hedge its exposure to gas production which it purchases at a percentage of index when market opportunities appear attractive 
the partnership s processing plants at plaquemine and gibson have a variety of processing contract structures 
in general  the partnership buys gas under keep whole arrangements in which it bears the risk of processing  percentage of proceeds arrangements in which it receives a percentage of the value of the liquids recovered  and theoretical processing arrangements in which the settlement with the producer is based on an assumed processing result 
because the partnership has the ability to bypass certain volumes when processing is uneconomic  it can limit its exposure to adverse processing margins 
during periods when processing margins are favorable  the partnership can substantially increase the volumes it is processing  as was the case in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   the partnership purchased a small amount approximately of the natural gas volumes on its gregory system under contracts in which it was exposed to the risk of loss or gain in processing the natural gas 
the partnership purchased the remaining approximately of the natural gas volumes on its gregory system at a spot or market price less a discount that includes a fixed margin for gathering  processing and marketing the natural gas and ngls at its gregory processing plant with no risk of loss or gain in processing the natural gas 
the partnership s conroe gas plant and gathering system generates revenues based on fees it charges to producers for gathering and compression services  and it retains of the ngls produced from a portion of the gas processed at the facility 
the partnership owns an undivided interest in the seminole gas processing plant  which is located in gaines county  texas 
the seminole plant has dedicated long term reserves from the seminole san andres unit  to which it also supplies carbon dioxide under a long term arrangement 
revenues at the plant are derived from a fee it charges producers  including those at the seminole san andres unit  for each mcf of carbon dioxide returned to the producer for reinjection 
the fees currently average approximately for each mcf of carbon dioxide returned 
reinjected carbon dioxide is used in a tertiary oil recovery process in the field 
the plant also receives of the ngls produced by the plant 
therefore  the partnership has commodity price exposure due to variances in the prices of ngls 
during  our share of ngls totaled  gallons at an average price of per gallon 
gas prices can also affect the partnership s profitability indirectly by influencing drilling activity and related opportunities for gas gathering  treating and processing 
results of operations set forth in the table below is certain financial and operating data for the midstream and treating divisions for the periods indicated 

table of contents year ended december  dollars in millions midstream revenues midstream purchased gas midstream gross margin treating revenues treating purchased gas treating gross margin total gross margin midstream volumes mmbtu d gathering and transportation processing producer services treating plants in operation at year end year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross margin 
midstream gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of the lig assets on april  and defs assets acquired on june   which added an incremental million and million  respectively  to midstream gross margin 
the volume growth of  mmbtu d  or  in gathering  transportation  and processing was primarily due to the acquired lig and defs assets 
also contributing to improved margins were higher than expected processing margins and volumes from existing gas operations  which increased margins million from to treating gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was due to the seminole plant  one of the assets acquired from defs  being owned for a full year 
the seminole plant has increased from of operating income in to of operating income during as the seminole plant interest was only owned for the last six months of also contributing to the significant growth was the placement of an additional plants in service since december   which was offset in part by plant retirements 
the net plant additions of generated million in additional gross margin 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
increases of million and million were associated with the acquisition of the defs and lig assets  respectively 
general operations expense expense not directly related to specific assets was for compared to million for the majority of the million increase was related to higher technical services support required by the newly acquired assets and additional expenditures related to our pipeline integrity program 
the growth in treating plants in service increased operating expenses by million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
a significant contributor was additional staffing related costs  an incremental million over the staff additions required to manage and optimize the lig and defs acquisitions account for the majority of the change  although a number of leadership and strategic positions were added that will allow us to absorb future growth more efficiently 
consistent with staffing for future growth  an additional million in consulting costs were made to upgrade systems  providing a more scalable infrastructure 
sarbanes oxley compliance costs are million for  compared to zero for a million increase due to unsuccessful transaction costs was a result of  among other things  the size of the 
table of contents acquisitions pursued 
other expenses  including audit and tax fees  office rent  k preparation fees and travel expenses  accounted for million of the increase 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during  certain of our outstanding options were accounted for using variable accounting due to a cash out modification offered for such options and stock compensation expense was recognized because the estimated fair value of the options increased during the cash out modification offered during that caused the variable accounting treatment expired on december  and  effective january   the remaining options are accounted for as fixed options 
stock based compensation recognized in represents the amortization of costs associated with awards under long term incentive plans  including restricted units and option grants with exercise prices below market prices on the grant date 
impairment 
an impairment of  was recognized during related to a processing plant that is owned directly by us 
this plant has been inactive since late when the operator of the wells behind the plant cancelled its drilling plans for the area 
an impairment on the contracts associated with the plant was recorded in but the value of the plant was not impaired because we intended to restart or relocate the plant 
drilling activity has increased in the area near the plant and processing margins have improved during so management decided to more fully evaluate the cost of restarting this idle plant 
management determined that it would be more commercially feasible to put a new plant at the plant site than to invest the capital necessary to restart the plant 
if we do not restart the plant  our engineers estimate that the plant would receive very little  if any  value upon the sale of the plant 
therefore  we have impaired the full value of the plant during profit loss on energy trading activities 
the profit on energy trading activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  included in these amounts are realized margins on delivered volumes in the producer services off system gas marketing operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gain on sale of property 
during  the partnership sold two small gathering systems and recognized a net gain on sale of  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase related to the defs assets was million and the increase related to the lig assets was million 
new treating plants placed in service resulted in an increase of million 
the remaining increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily a result of expansion projects and other new assets  including the expansion of the gregory plant and the consolidation of denton county assets 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase relates primarily to an increase in average debt outstanding 
average higher interest rates also increased from to weighted average rate of in compared to in 
other income 
other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  other income in includes the write off of  related to an environmental liability accrued in connection with the june acquisition of properties from defs which was in excess of amounts spent to resolve the environmental matters identified at the time of acquisition 
in addition  other income in includes  related to a reimbursement for a construction project in excess of our costs for such project 
income tax expense 
we provide for income taxes using the liability method 
accordingly  deferred taxes are recorded for the differences between the tax and book basis of assets and liabilities that will reverse in future periods 
our income tax provision was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in the tax provision was primarily due to the taxes provided on the million gain on issuance of units of the partnership during partially offset by taxes provided on 
table of contents higher operating income in we estimate that we will generate a net operating loss in the current tax provision of approximately  represents current taxes related to the partnership s wholly owned corporate lig subsidiaries 
interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income 
we recorded an expense of million in and million in associated with the interests of non controlling partners in the partnership 
this expense increased between periods because the partnership s net income increased by million from to and the non controlling partners ownership in the partnership increased from to in september as a result of the issuance of additional common units to the public shareholders 
the increases related to partnership net income and non controlling partner ownership were partially offset by the impact of incentive distributions increasing from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  income from the partnership is allocated to us for its incentive distributions with the remaining income being allocated pro rata to the general partner interest and the common unit and subordinated units 
net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
net income decreased from to primarily due to the gain on sale of issuance of units of the partnership in of million and an increase in the expenses for the non controlling partners share of partnership net income of million  partially offset by an increase of million in operating income and a decrease of million in the income tax provision 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross margin 
midstream gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the largest increase in gross margin was due to the acquisition of assets from defs on june  these assets added gross margin of million 
the corpus christi system had significant growth due to an increase in on system volume and the addition of the hallmark lateral  resulting in an increase in margin of million 
we acquired the vanderbilt gathering system on december   this system added gross margin of million 
gregory gathering system and gregory processing plant had increased margin of million 
these systems had significant growth in volume due to producer drilling activity in the area  to which the partnership responded with the gregory plant expansion during the gulf coast system had increased margin of million despite the fact that volumes declined 
the reason for the decline in volume was because we sourced two markets from vanderbilt the last half of that were previously sourced from the gulf coast system 
we had an increase in volume and increase in margin due to a large customer taking gas from our system for months in and only six months in  and we had increased margin due to renegotiation of producer contracts 
the arkoma system also had increased volume  creating an increase in margin of million 
treating gross margin was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in  an increase of million  or 
seminole asset acquired from defs accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining increase was due to new plants placed in service in  which generated million offset by plants removed from service in  which decreased margin by million a net increase of million 
in addition  an increase in volume at two plants with throughput based contracts accounted for million of the increase in treating margin 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
an increase of million was associated with the acquisition of assets from defs in june costs for the partnership s technical services support increased by approximately million due to staff additions to operate the assets acquired in december and in june from defs and to manage other construction projects 
the vanderbilt system added million to operating expenses  new treating plants increased operating expenses by million and the gregory plant expansion added million in operating expenses 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to increases in staffing associated with the requirements of the defs acquisition and associated with the partnership being a public entity 
we also recognized an additional bad debt reserve of million related to the company s enron receivable based on current recovery estimates from enron s bankruptcy proceedings 
impairments 
the partnership had no impairment expense in compared to a million charge in  primarily related to contract valuations recorded as intangible assets as part of the partnership s formation 
profit loss on energy trading activities 
the profit on energy trading activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
included in these amounts are realized margins on delivered volumes in the producer services off system gas marketing operations of million in and million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in our producer services volumes 
in addition  losses of million and million relating primarily to options bought and or sold in the management of the company s enron position were booked in and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase related to the duke assets purchased in june was million 
the vanderbilt system  purchased in december added million of depreciation  new treating plants placed in service in resulted in an increase of million and the hallmark system added million 
the remaining million increase in depreciation and amortization is a result of expansion projects and other new assets  such as the expansion of the gregory plant 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase relates primarily to bank debt incurred in the acquisition of the duke assets in june and by higher interest rates weighted average rate of in compared to in 
gain on issuance of units in the partnership 
in conjunction with the partnership s december initial public offering of common units  we conveyed to the partnership our entire interest in the partnership s predecessor in exchange for a general partner interest in the partnership   common units and  subordinated units of the partnership 
as a result of the partnership issuing additional units to the public in its initial public offering at a price per unit greater than our equivalent carrying value  our share of the net assets of the partnership increased by million 
accordingly  we recognized an million gain in income tax expense 
our income tax provision was million in compared to million in  an increase of approximately million 
this increase was primarily due to the increase in the gain on issuance of units of the partnership and the increase in operating income 
we did not have a current tax liability in due to the availability of our net operating loss carryforward 
interest of non controlling partners in the partnership s net income 
we recorded an expense of million in and  in associated with the interest of non controlling partners in the partnership 
we owned all of the interests in the partnership and its predecessors until its december initial public offering 
net income loss 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase in net income was principally the result of the increase of million in gains on issuance of units in the partnership and the increase in gross margin of million from to  offset by increases in ongoing cash costs for operating expenses general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income taxes as discussed above 
non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expenses and stock based compensation also increased 

table of contents critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
compliance with the rules necessarily involves reducing a number of very subjective judgments to a quantifiable accounting entry or valuation 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
for further details on our accounting policies and a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and commodity risk management 
we recognize revenue for sales or services at the time the natural gas or natural gas liquids are delivered or at the time the service is performed 
the partnership engages in price risk management activities in order to minimize the risk from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the partnership manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance its future commitments and significantly reduce its risk to the movement in natural gas prices 
prior to january   financial instruments which qualified for hedge accounting were accounted for using the deferral method of accounting  whereby unrealized gains and losses were generally not recognized until the physical delivery required by the contracts was made 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 all derivatives and hedging instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value can be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the partnership conducts off system gas marketing operations as a service to producers on systems that it does not own 
we refer to these activities as part of producer services 
in some cases  the partnership earns an agency fee from the producer for arranging the marketing of the producer s natural gas which is recognized net in profit from energy trading activities 
in other cases  the partnership purchases the natural gas from the producer and enters into a sales contract with another party to sell the natural gas 
where the partnership takes title to the natural gas  the purchase contract is recorded as cost of gas purchased and the sales contract is recorded as revenue upon delivery 
the partnership manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments for producer services activities by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance its future commitments and significantly reduce its risk to the movement in natural gas prices 
however  the partnership is subject to counterparty risk for both the physical and financial contracts 
prior to october   we accounted for our producer services natural gas marketing activities as energy trading contracts in accordance with eitf  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
eitf required energy trading contracts to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
in october  the eitf reached a consensus to rescind eitf no 
accordingly  energy trading contracts entered into subsequent to october   should be accounted for under accrual basis accounting rather than mark to market accounting unless the contracts meet the requirements of a derivative under sfas no 
the partnership s energy trading contracts qualify as derivatives  and accordingly  we continue to use mark to market accounting for both physical and financial contracts of its producer services business 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives and physical delivery contracts relating to the partnership s producer services natural gas marketing activities are recognized in earnings as profit or loss on energy trading contracts immediately 

table of contents for each reporting period  we record the fair value of open energy trading contracts based on the difference between the quoted market price and the contract price 
accordingly  the change in fair value from the previous period in addition to the realized gains or losses on settled activities are reported as profit or loss on energy trading activities in the statements of operations 
sales of securities by subsidiaries 
we recognize gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations resulting from subsidiary sales of additional equity interest  including the partnership s limited partnership units  to unrelated parties 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the purchase and resale margins on natural gas  volume of gas available to the asset  markets available to the asset  operating expenses  and future natural gas prices and ngl product prices 
the amount of availability of gas to an asset is sometimes based on assumptions regarding future drilling activity  which may be dependent in part on natural gas prices 
projections of gas volumes and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located  the availability and prices of natural gas supply  the partnership s ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements  the risks that natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  the partnership s dependence on certain significant customers  producers  and transporters of natural gas  and competition from other midstream companies  including major energy producers 
any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  income before non cash income and expenses was million in and million in changes in working capital used million in cash flows from operating activities in and provided million in cash flows from operating activities in income before non cash income and expenses increased between years primarily due to asset acquisitions as discussed in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  changes in working capital are primarily due to the timing of collections at the end of the quarterly periods 
the partnership collects and pays large receivables and payables at the end of each calendar month and the timing of these payments and receipts may vary by a day or two between month end periods  causing these fluctuations 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively

financing activities in relate principally to the funding of the defs assets acquisition and internal growth projects discussed above from bank borrowings and proceeds from the sale of common units discussed below 
financing activities also included an increase in drafts payable of million for the year ended december  and a decrease in drafts payable of million for the year ended december  in order to reduce our interest costs  we borrow money to fund outstanding checks as they are presented to the bank 
fluctuations in drafts payable are caused by timing of disbursements  cash receipts and draws on our revolving credit facility 
working capital deficit 
we had a working capital deficit of million as of december   primarily due to drafts payable of million as of the same date 
as discussed under cash flows above  in order to reduce our interest costs we do not borrow money to fund outstanding checks until they are presented to our bank 
we borrow money under our million acquisition credit facility to fund checks as they are presented 
as of december   we had million of available borrowings under this facility 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and september sale of common units 
in september  the partnership completed a public offering of  common units at a public offering price of per common unit 
it received net proceeds of approximately million  including an approximate million capital contribution by us 
the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facility of the partnership s operating partnership 
crosstex energy  inc initial public offering 
in january  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock whereby our existing shareholders sold  shares of common stock and we issued  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the common stock issuance 
additionally  and in conjunction with the public offering  our existing shareholders also repaid approximately million in shareholder notes receivable 
we had million cash on hand at december   and we have no annual capital expenditure requirements 
as a result  we believe we have adequate cash on hand for our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
capital requirements of the partnership 
the natural gas gathering  transmission  treating and processing businesses are capital intensive  requiring significant investment to maintain and upgrade existing operations 
the partnership s capital requirements have consisted primarily of  and it anticipates will continue to be maintenance capital expenditures  which are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain existing operating capacity of the partnership s assets and to extend their useful lives  or other capital expenditures which do not increase the partnership s cash flows  and growth capital expenditures such as those to acquire additional assets to grow the partnership s business  to expand and upgrade gathering systems  transmission capacity  processing plants or treating plants  and to construct or acquire new pipelines  processing plants or treating plants 
given the partnership s objective of growth through acquisitions  it anticipates that it will continue to invest significant amounts of capital to grow and acquire assets 
the partnership actively considers a variety of assets for potential acquisitions 

table of contents the partnership believes that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its present quarterly distribution level of per quarter and to fund a portion of its anticipated capital expenditures through december  total capital expenditures are budgeted to be approximately million in although we anticipated significantly higher capital expenditures due to pending projects such as the north texas pipeline project 
the partnership expects to fund the remaining capital expenditures from the proceeds of borrowings under the revolving credit facility discussed below  and future issuances of units 
the partnership s ability to pay distributions to its unit holders and to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in its industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond its control

credit risk the partnership is diligent in attempting to ensure that it issues credit to only credit worthy customers 
however  the partnership s purchase and resale of gas exposes it to significant credit risk  as the margin on any sale is generally a very small percentage of the total sale price 
therefore  a credit loss can be very large relative to its overall profitability 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   or although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and the partnership s existing agreements  it has and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees 
environmental and other contingencies the partnership s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
the partnership believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations

in addition to specific uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this form k  the following risks and uncertainties may affect our performance and results of operations our only cash generating assets are our partnership interests in the partnership  and our cash flow is therefore completely dependent upon the ability of the partnership to make distributions to its partners  the value of our investment in the partnership depends largely on the partnership s being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  the amount of cash distributions from the partnership that we will be able to distribute to you will be reduced by our expenses  including federal corporate income taxes and the costs of being a public company  and reserves for future dividends  so long as we own the general partner of the partnership  we are prohibited by an omnibus agreement with the partnership from engaging in the business of gathering  transmitting  treating  processing  storing  and marketing natural gas and transporting  fractionating  storing and marketing ngls  except to the extent that the partnership  with the concurrence of its independent directors comprising its conflicts committee  elects not to engage in a particular acquisition or expansion opportunity  in our corporate charter  we have renounced business opportunities that may be pursued by the partnership or by affiliated stockholders that hold a majority of our common stock  bryan lawrence  the chairman of our board of directors  is a senior manager at yorktown partners llc  the manager of the yorktown group of investment partnerships yorktown  which until january  in the aggregate owned more than of our common shares 
yorktown has been reducing its ownership in the company through a process of distribution of shares to its investors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the partnership s primary market risk is the risk related to changes in the prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl s 
in addition  it is also exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt 

table of contents commodity price risk 
approximately of the natural gas the partnership purchases for resale is purchased on a percentage of the relevant natural gas price index  as opposed to a fixed discount to that price 
as a result of purchasing the gas at a percentage of the index price  the partnership s margins are higher during periods of higher natural gas prices and lower during periods of lower natural gas prices 
the partnership has hedged approximately of its exposure to gas price fluctuations through the end of another price risk the partnership faces is the risk of mismatching volumes of gas bought or sold on a monthly price versus volumes bought or sold on a daily price 
the partnership enters each month with a balanced book of gas bought and sold on the same basis 
however  it is normal to experience fluctuations in the volumes of gas bought or sold under either basis  which leaves it with short or long positions that must be covered 
the partnership uses financial swaps to mitigate the exposure at the time it is created to maintain a balanced position 
the partnership has commodity price risk associated with its processed volumes of natural gas 
the partnership currently processes gas under four main types of contractual arrangements keep whole contracts under this type of contract  the partnership pays the producer for the full amount of inlet gas to the plant  and makes a margin based on the difference between the value of liquids recovered from the processed natural gas as compared to the value of the natural gas volumes lost shrink in processing 
the partnership s margins from these contracts are high during periods of high liquids prices relative to natural gas prices  and can be negative during periods of high natural gas prices relative to liquids prices 
the partnership controls its risk on our current keep whole contracts through its ability to bypass processing when it is not profitable 
percent of proceeds contracts under these contracts  the partnership receives a fee in the form of a percentage of the liquids recovered  and the producer bears all the cost of the natural gas shrink 
therefore  its margins from these contracts are greater during periods of high liquids prices 
the partnership s margins from processing cannot become negative under percent of proceeds contracts  but decline during periods of low ngl prices 
theoretical processing contracts under these contracts  the partnership stipulates with the producer the assumptions under which it will assume processing economics for settlement purposes  independent of actual processing results or whether the stream was actually processed 
these contracts tend to have an inverse result to the keep whole contracts  with better margins as processing economics worsen 
fee based contracts under these contracts the partnership has no commodity price exposure  and is paid a fixed fee per unit of volume that is treated or conditioned 
the partnership s primary commodity risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows 
the partnership maintains a risk management committee  including members of senior management  which oversees all hedging activity 
the partnership enters into hedges for natural gas and natural gas liquids using nymex futures or over the counter derivative financial instruments with only certain well capitalized counterparties which have been approved by its risk management committee 
hedges to protect its processing margins are generally for a more limited time frame than is possible for hedges in natural gas  as the financial markets for ngls are not as developed as the markets for natural gas 
the use of financial instruments may expose the partnership to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments or counterparties fail to purchase the contracted quantities of natural gas or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that the partnership engages in hedging activities it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  the partnership is similarly insulated against unfavorable changes in such prices 
the partnership manages its price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments for its producer services activities by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance its future commitments and significantly reduce its risk to the movement in natural gas prices 
however  the partnership is subject to counterparty risk for both the physical 
table of contents and financial contracts 
the partnership accounts for certain of its producer services natural gas marketing activities as energy trading contracts or derivatives 
these energy trading contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with changes in the fair value of derivatives and physical delivery contracts relating to its producer services natural gas marketing activities are recognized in earnings as profit or loss on energy trading contracts immediately 
set forth below is the summarized notional amount and terms of all instruments held for price risk management purposes at december  all quantities are expressed in british thermal units 
the remaining term of the contracts extend no later than october  with no single contract longer than months 
the partnership s counterparties to derivative contracts include bp corporation  ubs energy and total gas power 
changes in the fair value of the partnership s derivatives related to third party producers and customers gas marketing activities are recorded in earnings 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the related anticipated future cash flow is recognized in earnings and the ineffective portion is recorded in earnings

credit risk 
the partnership is diligent in attempting to ensure that it issues credit to only credit worthy customers 
however  its purchase and resale of gas exposes it to significant credit risk  as the margin on any sale is generally a very small percentage of the total sale price 
therefore  a credit loss can be very large relative to the partnership s overall profitability
