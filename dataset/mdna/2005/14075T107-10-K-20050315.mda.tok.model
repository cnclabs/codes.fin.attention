during these inspections  we were found to be substantially in compliance with the cgmp regulations 
while the fda did issue us an fda list of observations after each inspection  we do not believe they are material and we have taken appropriate remedial actions

sales of two products accounted for approximately and of sales in and  respectively 
net sales have also improved for the following reasons we have been successful in obtaining larger sales contracts in with an agency of the us government in june and with one large mail order company during so that we have benefited from sales pursuant to such contracts for all of as compared to part of with our larger base of products  we have been able to attract both new customers  and larger orders

as a result of increased sales  the gross profit margin has also improved when comparing the gross profit margins for and gross profit margin for was as compared to for the increases were the result of changes in sales mix to higher profit margin products

further improved efficiency in the overall manufacturing process associated with higher utilization of plant capacity

interest expense on loans from the edc  sun pharma and its affiliates  icici bank and the bank of nova scotia  was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in the amount of interest is primarily due to paying off the sun pharma loans during the second and third quarters of results of operations 
we earned net income of million for as compared to incurring a net loss of million for the significantly higher income for as compared to is primarily due to higher sales volumes  better cost absorption  an improved product mix and obtaining more competitive prices for raw materials 
in comparison  the net sales in were inadequate to absorb all expenses including interest cost and non cash technology transfer cost 
also  the higher utilization of new equipment installed helped to improve production volumes and productivity 
the following table presents a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the four quarters in and the unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair statement of such information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past  may continue to do so and are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
in thousands  except per share data quarter quarter quarter quarter net sales     net profit loss    earnings per share basic diluted in thousands  except per share data quarter quarter quarter quarter net sales     net profit loss    earnings per share basic diluted liquidity and capital resources during  we generated cash of million from operations as compared to cash of million during the higher cash generation during has been primarily due to higher sales volumes  better cost absorption  an improved product mix  obtaining more competitive prices for raw materials and better utilization of new equipment to improve production and productivity 
in addition to paying down debt  the cash generated from operations for both and was used to finance our capital expenditures of million during and million during during  we repaid the entire balance of million due to icici bank limited and the million mortgage loan due to the economic development corporation of the city of detroit the edc  and repaid million due to the bank of nova scotia 
these payoffs were funded from internal cash flow and by utilizing a million credit line arranged with citibank  fsb 
we have also repaid the entire borrowing of million from citibank during these repayments leave us debt free other than normal accounts payables and accruals at december   and our entire property  plant  equipment and intellectual property free of any mortgages  liens or restrictions 
in comparison  during we borrowed million from the bank of nova scotia and repaid the entire sun pharma loans of million and the scheduled payments of million to the edc and million to the icici bank 
during  we generated million from the exercise of stock options by sun pharma  our employees and one officer and director 
during  we generated million from the exercise of stock options by our employees and directors 
at december   we had working capital of million compared to a negative working capital of million at december  the negative working capital as on december  was primarily due to classification of loans as current of million due to icici bank and the bank of nova scotia and million due to the edc 
the available increased cash flow during was partly utilized to increase inventories  up from million in to million 
these increased inventories served us well to satisfy increased sales requirement from million in to million in to meet customer demands in timely manner  it is essential to keep sufficient inventories at all levels including finished goods stock 
therefore  if necessary  the trend of increasing inventories will continue in to support increased sales 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet transactions contractual obligations in thousands payment due contractual obligations years operating leases there are no other contractual obligations requiring disclosure 
off balance sheet transactions none future outlook management feels that our future outlook looks bright  as we have been substantially compliant with cgmps since  and received approvals of andas  expanded and upgraded our facilities and expanded our customer base during the last four years 
our efforts in developing new products has also picked up momentum and this should permit us to grow at a reasonable level 
we are optimistic that we will achieve our previously stated guidance of to revenue growth during pricing pressures  however  due to increased competition  have continued during and are expected to continue in  which may result in lower growth rates and gross margins 
management has and will continue to work diligently to counter the pricing pressures through increased sales volumes  better cost absorption of operational overheads  and cost reductions 
as disclosed  under the products agreement dated november  between sun global and the company  sun global has agreed to transfer the technology for products to the company over a five year period in exchange for  preferred shares which are convertible on a one to one basis into common shares per product 
since the date of the products agreement  the company has selected products for development and nine of these products have passed their respective bio equivalency studies one in december  seven in and one in january 
if some or all of the remaining products pass their bio equivalency studies in  the fair value of the preferred shares earned by sun global in exchange for such products could cause our non cash research and development expenses to increase to an amount which would significantly decrease profit or create a loss 
while the development of new products will increase both our cash and non cash r d expense and will impact eps  we expect that cash will be available  among other things  to meet increased working capital requirements  fund potential paragraph iv certification litigation and finance further capital investments 
the company will continue to aggressively move forward with the development of new products 
we believe that receiving products from sun provides us with a partner with a proven track record  one that already has provided us with quality products 
moreover  sun pharma s increased beneficial ownership in us to approximately including its convertible series b preferred stock  should  we believe  provide it with the incentive to continue to help us succeed 
sun pharma has previously provided us with capital  loans  guarantees of loans  personnel  raw materials and equipment  which have significantly helped us to date 
management s plans for the remainder of include a continued focus and improvement on fda compliance 
b increased pace of research and development activities  with a view to maximize anda filings 
c continue to invest in equipment and facility to expand capacity to meet requirements of projected growth in near term 
d increased market share for certain existing products and recently introduced new products and enhanced customer reach and satisfaction 
e prompt introduction of new approved products to the market 
f achieving further operational efficiencies by attaining economies of scale and cost reduction per unit 
g increase the number of products  as well as anticipated volume increases for existing products  which  in turn  will improve manufacturing capacity utilization 
h considering alternative ways of increasing cash flow including developing  manufacturing and marketing andas owned by sun pharma
