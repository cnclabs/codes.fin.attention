item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to our critical accounting policies and factors set forth under factors that may affect future results below and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company that specializes in acute hospital care products  with growing revenue from sales of our first product  angiomax bivalirudin 
angiomax is a direct thrombin inhibitor that was approved by the fda in december for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing coronary angioplasty 
we are also currently developing angiomax for other indications 
we have concentrated our commercial sales and marketing resources on the us hospital market 
since we began selling angiomax in  revenues to date have been generated principally from sales of angiomax in the united states 
in september  we received authorization from the european commission to market angiomax bivalirudin as angiox bivalirudin in the member states of the european union for use as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions 
we began selling angiox to nycomed danmark a s  one of our european distribution partners  in august in anticipation of this approval 
our total net revenue was million in  million in and million in  and we achieved profitability on an annual basis for the first time in  with net income of million 
we focus on increased use of angiomax by existing hospital customers  as well as penetration to new hospitals  to evaluate our operating performance 
since the announcement of the results of our replace clinical trial in november  additional hospitals have granted angiomax formulary approval and hospital demand for the product has increased  which are critical elements of our ability to increase revenues 
specifically  in  based on data from a third party industry source  the number of hospitals purchasing angiomax increased by approximately as compared to and the number of hospitals purchasing four or more boxes of angiomax increased by approximately as compared to from our inception through the third quarter of  we generated losses on a quarterly basis as we incurred significant research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses relating to our development activities 
in the last five consecutive quarters  as we have generated increased sales of angiomax  we have been profitable 
research and development expenses represent costs incurred for product acquisition  clinical trials  and activities relating to regulatory filings and manufacturing development efforts 
we outsource much of our clinical trials and all of our manufacturing development activities to independent organizations to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  general corporate activities and costs associated with promotion and marketing activities 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the development of our products in the future 
in  we plan to continue to invest in clinical studies to expand the approved indications for angiomax and to develop clevelox and cangrelor 
we also plan to continue our sales and marketing programs to promote angiomax and educate and inform physicians  nurses  pharmacists and other medical decision makers about the benefits of angiomax 
in light of these activities  as well as our plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of late development stage or approved products that fit within our growth strategy  we will likely need to generate greater revenues to maintain profitability 
in  we had our first year of us taxable income 
we have accrued for us and state alternative minimum taxes  state taxes based on net worth and some income taxes in international jurisdictions in our financial statements 
at december   net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately million 
if not utilized  federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in and ending in we have provided a full valuation allowance against the potential tax benefit of our net operating losses since the realization of these benefits is not considered more likely than not 
the future utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited based upon changes in ownership pursuant to regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
application of critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  fit the definition of critical accounting estimates included in this annual report on form k 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition and inventory described below fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition product sales 
we sell our products primarily to wholesalers and distributors  who  in turn  sell to hospitals 
we do not recognize revenue from product sales until there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay us  the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  we have no obligation to bring about the sale of the product  the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record allowances for product returns  chargebacks  rebates and other discounts at the time of sale  and report revenue net of such amounts 
in determining allowances for product returns  chargebacks and rebates  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
for example  in determining these amounts  we estimate hospital demand  buying patterns by hospitals and group purchasing organizations from wholesalers and the levels of inventory held by wholesalers 
making these determinations involves estimating whether trends in past buying patterns will predict future product sales 
the nature of our allowances requiring critical accounting estimates  and the specific considerations we use in estimating their amounts  are as follows product returns 
our customers have the right to return any unopened product during the month period beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending months after the labeled expiration date 
as a result  in calculating the allowance for product returns  we must estimate the likelihood that product sold to wholesalers might remain in their inventory to within six months of expiration and analyze the likelihood that such product will be returned within months after expiration 
in estimating the likelihood of product remaining in our wholesalers inventory  we rely on information from our wholesalers regarding their inventory levels  measured hospital demand as reported by third party sources and on internal sales data 
we believe the information from our wholesalers and third party sources is directionally reliable  but we are unable to verify the accuracy of such data independently 
we also consider our wholesalers past buying patterns  estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped and the expiration dates of product currently being shipped 
in estimating the likelihood of product return  we rely primarily on historic patterns of returns and estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped 
during  million of angiomax was returned to us  representing approximately of the total revenue from angiomax sales 
at december  and  our allowance for returns was million and million  respectively 
a change in our allowance for product returns in would have an approximate million effect on our reported revenue in chargebacks and rebates 
although we sell angiomax primarily to wholesalers and distributors  we typically enter into agreements with hospitals  either directly or through group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their hospital members  in connection with the hospitals purchases of angiomax from our wholesalers 
based on the terms of these agreements  most of our hospital customers have the right to receive a discounted price and volume based rebate on product purchases 
we provide a credit to the wholesaler  or a chargeback  representing the difference between the wholesaler s acquisition list price and the discounted price 
as a result of these contracts  at the time of product shipment  we must estimate the likelihood that angiomax sold to wholesalers might be ultimately sold to a contracting hospital or group purchasing organization 
we must also estimate the contracting hospital s or group purchasing organization s volume of purchases 
we base our estimates on the historic chargeback data we receive from wholesalers  which detail historic buying patterns and sales mix for particular hospitals and group purchasing organizations  and the applicable customer chargeback rates and rebate thresholds 
at december  and  our allowance for chargebacks was million and million  respectively  and our allowance for rebates was million and million  respectively 
a change in our allowance for chargebacks would have had an approximate million effect on our reported revenue in  and a change in our allowance for rebates would have had an approximate million effect on our reported revenue in we have adjusted our allowances for product returns  chargebacks and rebates in the past based on our actual sales experience  and we will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
we continually monitor our allowances and make adjustments when we believe actual experience may differ from our estimates 
the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our allowances over the course of amounts in thousands returns chargebacks rebates balance at december  allowances for sales during actual credits issued for prior years sales actual credits issued for sales during balance at december  we have offered  and occasionally will offer in the future  incentives to wholesalers to ensure that they have what we believe are appropriate stocks of product to meet expected increased demand as a result of events such as clinical trials  regulatory approvals and competitive developments  or to ensure that they are stocking within a normal range of inventory for a product like angiomax 
because our three largest us wholesalers accounted for nearly of our net revenue in  it is critical that these wholesalers have adequate inventory to meet product demand 
we only began selling angiomax in the united states in  and wholesaler buying patterns have sometimes been unpredictable 
in addition  product demand has generally not grown at a uniform rate 
for example  we experienced an accelerated rate of demand for angiomax following commercial launch and following the announcement of replace trial results in november we believe that wholesaler inventories as of december  were within a normal range for a product like angiomax  and we believe that sales recorded for the year ended december  were generally representative of underlying demand for angiomax 
we have no agreements  understandings or business practices under which we extend incentives based on levels of inventory held by wholesalers in excess of ordinary course of business inventory levels  and any incentives we may offer are not intended to have any relation to the wholesalers cost of carrying inventory 
international distribution partners 
under our agreements with international distribution partners  we sell our product to these distribution partners at a percentage of the distribution partner s established net price 
the established net price is typically determined in the quarter in which we sell our products to these distribution partners based on the distribution partner s net selling price 
in those situations  usually prior to product launch  where product is sold prior to the establishment of the distribution partner s selling price  we initially record revenue at minimum prices outlined in these agreements and later adjust our selling price to the distribution partner once the partner s net selling price is determined 
in accordance with the terms of these agreements  under no circumstances would the subsequent adjustment result in the net selling price being lower than the minimum price 
revenue from the sale of distribution rights includes milestone payments 
we record these payments as deferred revenue until contractual performance obligations have been satisfied  and we then recognize these payments ratably over the term of these agreements 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  we must estimate the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we review these estimates at least annually  which could result in a change in the deferral period 
inventory we record inventory upon the transfer of title from our vendors 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value 
angiomax bulk product is classified as raw materials  and its costs are determined using acquisition costs 
work in progress costs of filling  finishing and packaging are recorded against specific product batches 
prior to fda approval of angiomax and its original manufacturing process in december  we expensed all of these costs as research and development 
we recorded as inventory any angiomax bulk drug product manufactured using the original manufacturing process to which we took title after fda approval 
together with our contract manufacturer  ucb bioproducts  we have developed a second generation chemical synthesis process  the chemilog process  for the manufacture of angiomax bulk drug substance 
in may  we received fda approval for this process 
all angiomax bulk drug product manufactured using the chemilog process to which title had transferred to us prior to fda approval was expensed as research and development at the time of transfer of title  and all bulk drug product manufactured after fda approval of the chemilog process has been and will continue to be recorded as inventory upon transfer of title from our vendor 
we review our inventory for slow moving or obsolete amounts based on expected revenues 
if actual revenues are less than expected  we may be required to make allowances for excess amounts of inventory in the future 
results of operations years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for as compared to million for as shown in the table below  for  approximately of net revenue was derived from us sales of angiomax and approximately million of net revenue was derived from international sales  mostly related to stocking of angiox by one of our european distributors 
virtually all of our revenue in was derived from us sales of angiomax 
we believe that in addition to the international sales  growth in was due primarily to increased use of angiomax in the united states by existing hospital customers  adoption of angiomax by new hospital customers and higher prices as a result of a price increase to our wholesalers in june net revenue year ended december  net revenue of total revenue of total revenue in thousands in thousands angiomax united states sales international sales total net revenue in the third quarter of  we shipped to nycomed danmark a s  one of our european distribution partners  vials of angiox to be sold in europe after european regulatory approval 
pursuant to our distribution agreement  nycomed paid a minimum transfer price per vial for these pre approval vials  which we recognized as revenue in the third quarter of and agreed that once the price of the product to end users was established  the effective transfer price payable to us for the pre approval vials would be recalculated based on the end user price 
the effective transfer price could not be less than the minimum transfer price 
following determination of the effective transfer price on a country by country basis in the fourth quarter of  nycomed paid to us on a per vial basis the difference between the effective transfer price and the minimum transfer price 
as a result  we recognized an additional million in revenue in the fourth quarter of relating to the third quarter product shipments 
in addition  we recognized million in revenue in the fourth quarter of relating to post approval product shipments to nycomed 
we expect to ship additional product to nycomed in the first quarter of in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of revenue from milestone payments related to the million and a million non refundable fees received from nycomed 
these payments were recorded as deferred revenue in and  respectively  and are being recognized ratably over the estimated term of our agreement with nycomed 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in was million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue in cost of revenue in consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of the angiomax sold  which represented of the cost of revenue  royalty expenses under our agreement with biogen idec  inc  which represented of the cost of revenue  and the logistics costs of selling angiomax  such as distribution  storage  and handling  which represented of the cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of the angiomax sold  which represented of the cost of revenue  royalty expenses under our agreement with biogen idec  which represented of the cost of revenue  and the logistics costs of selling angiomax  which represented of the cost of revenue 
our expenditures in connection with the manufacture of angiomax sold in and  and the decrease in our costs of manufacturing as a percentage of revenue from to  reflected our transition from selling angiomax manufactured using the original manufacturing process to selling angiomax manufactured using the chemilog process 
the cost of manufacturing using the chemilog process is lower than the cost of manufacturing using the original manufacturing process 
in  we sold angiomax that had been manufactured using the original manufacturing process until the third quarter 
late in the third quarter of  we began selling angiomax that was manufactured using the chemilog process prior to fda approval of that process in may all costs of manufacturing this angiomax had been expensed as research and development costs and therefore were not reflected in cost of revenue 
as a result  our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of revenue decreased substantially in the fourth quarter of compared to the first three quarters of in the first quarter of  we continued to sell angiomax produced using the chemilog process whose cost of manufacturing was previously expensed 
as a result  our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of net revenue continued to benefit 
late in the first quarter of  however  we began selling angiomax produced using the chemilog process to which we took title after fda approval of the process 
all costs of manufacturing this angiomax had been recorded as inventory  which is reflected in cost of revenue when sold  rather than as research and development expense 
since the second quarter of  and for the foreseeable future  we expect to sell angiomax produced using the chemilog process that has not been previously expensed 
we would expect  however  that our cost of manufacturing using the chemilog process will remain lower as a percentage of revenue than our cost of manufacturing using the original manufacturing process had been 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for  from million for the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a net million increase of angiomax clinical trial costs in  including an million increase in costs for acuity  our study of angiomax in patients presenting in the emergency department with acs  offset in part by a million decrease in the expenses related to the replace trial 
angiomax manufacturing and development costs decreased by million in as chemilog inventory was expensed prior to fda approval of the chemilog process in may the overall increase in research and development expenses for was also due to an increase of million in costs related to trials studying clevelox and an increase of million in infrastructure  cangrelor and other 
this increase was primarily due to million of cangrelor development costs and million of increased infrastructure costs for data management  statistical analysis and product safety related costs 
the following table identifies for each of our major research and development projects  our spending for and spending for past periods is not necessarily indicative of spending in future periods 
major research and development projects year ended december  research and development of total r d of total r d in thousands in thousands angiomax clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs total angiomax clevelox infrastructure  cangrelor and other we currently plan to spend approximately million to million on research and development in  of which approximately is planned for angiomax 
this anticipated increase in research and development spending in primarily reflects the expected completion of patient enrollment and associated expenditures relating to the acuity trial and clevelox and cangrelor phase iii trials 
angiomax 
we have a number of clinical trial programs currently underway for expanding the applications of angiomax for use as an intravenous anticoagulant in the treatment of arterial thrombosis  a condition involving the formation of blood clots in the arteries 
as of the date of this annual report  we are conducting a phase iii trial program studying the use of angiomax as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery  or cabg  with and without the use of a bypass pump  and in treatment of patients with a clinical condition known as heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome  or hit hitts  who are undergoing cabg  with and without the use of a bypass pump  and a randomized phase iii trial called acuity to study the use of angiomax in patients presenting to the emergency department with coronary syndromes who may be medically managed or ultimately treated in the catheterization laboratory or operating room 
we also completed three phase iv programs during  two of which investigated the use of angiomax with drug eluting stents and one that investigated angiomax in patients undergoing percutaneous peripheral angioplasties 
clevelox 
we have commenced five phase iii clinical trials in two programs in cardiac surgery 
two of these trials are patient efficacy studies with results expected later this year 
the three other trials are patient safety studies with results expected in mid to late cangrelor 
as of the date of this annual report  we are conducting a patient clinical trial in healthy volunteers to identify a dosing strategy for use of cangrelor in the cardiac catheterization laboratory 
we intend to commence phase iii clinical testing of cangrelor in our success in expanding the approved indications for angiomax  or developing our product candidates  is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for  from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million was primarily due to increased promotion expenditures  headcount additions and legal costs  including costs of settlement relating to an equal employment opportunity commission complaint 
non cash stock compensation 
we amortize the deferred stock compensation that was recorded in over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options 
we recorded amortization expense for such deferred compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amortization expense is included in our operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december  there is no additional deferred stock compensation expense to be amortized 
in september  we amended the terms of fully vested options to purchase  shares of common stock that were granted to a non employee consultant in may in addition  in may we granted options to a non employee consultant to purchase  shares at an exercise price based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the consulting agreement in april in each case  these options were valued utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
we recorded the million and million in non cash stock compensation expense associated with these options during and  respectively 
all of these options have now fully vested and we will not be required to record any additional associated non cash stock compensation expense 
other income 
other income  which is comprised of interest income  increased over to million for  from million for the increase in interest income of million was primarily due to higher rates of return on our available for sale securities in provision for income tax 
tax expense for was million  mostly reflecting us alternative minimum taxes based on our first full year of profitability and state taxes based on net worth 
years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as shown in the table below  virtually all the revenue in both periods was from us sales of angiomax 
we believe that growth in was due primarily to increased use of angiomax by existing hospital customers and adoption of angiomax by new hospital customers as well as higher prices as a result of a price increase to our wholesalers in june net revenue year ended december  net revenue of total revenue of total revenue in thousands in thousands angiomax united states sales international sales total net revenue in each of and  we recognized million of the million in deferred revenue we recorded in relating to the distributor fee received from nycomed 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in was million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue in cost of revenue in consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of the angiomax sold  which represented of the cost of revenue  royalty expenses under our agreement with biogen idec  which represented of the cost of revenue  and the logistics costs of selling angiomax  which represented of the cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of the angiomax sold  which represented of the cost of revenue  royalty expenses under our agreement with biogen idec  which represented of the cost of revenue and the logistics costs of selling angiomax  which represented of the cost of revenue 
prior to obtaining fda approval for angiomax and its original manufacturing process  all costs of manufacturing angiomax were expensed as research and development costs and therefore not reflected in cost of revenue 
in late  after obtaining fda approval for angiomax and its original manufacturing process  we began recording the costs of manufacturing angiomax as inventory  which is reflected in cost of revenue when sold  rather than as research and development expense 
during and in early  we took delivery of drug material manufactured using the chemilog process 
because this material was manufactured prior to fda approval of the chemilog process  all costs of manufacturing were previously expensed as research and development 
this process was approved by the fda on may   and we have recorded all costs of manufacturing angiomax incurred after may  as inventory 
although we sold some angiomax in that had been manufactured using the chemilog process and whose cost of manufacturing was previously expensed  all of the angiomax that we sold in and most of the angiomax that we sold in was manufactured using the original manufacturing process following the date of fda approval of angiomax 
we recorded the cost of manufacturing such material as cost of revenue during in  we sold a greater proportion of angiomax whose costs had been previously expensed than angiomax for which the cost of manufacturing needed to be recorded in as a result  our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of cost of revenue was higher in compared to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for  from million for the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to million less of clinical trial costs in relating to replace  which completed enrollment in  and million in lower manufacturing development costs incurred in connection with our receipt of angiomax manufactured using the chemilog process 
these lower costs were partly offset by the addition of clinical development costs of million for acuity  million in additional costs for clinical trial programs studying angiomax use in cardiac surgery and million in additional costs relating to clevelox development consisting of a million license fee to astrazeneca and manufacturing development and other start up costs relating to the two phase iii clinical trials we commenced in the fourth quarter of in patients undergoing cardiac surgery 
the lower overall research and development costs in were also partially offset by development expenses relating to cangrelor  which consisted of an initial payment to astrazeneca in connection with our license 
the following table identifies for each of our major research and development projects  our spending for and spending for past periods is not necessarily indicative of spending in future periods 
major research and development projects year ended december  research and development of total r d of total r d in thousands in thousands angiomax clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs total angiomax clevelox infrastructure  cangrelor and other we partially funded development activities relating to the chemilog process  including validation and process batch costs of approximately million and million incurred in and  respectively 
we expensed all of these development costs as research and development in the period incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for  from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million was primarily due to an increase in salary and recruiting expenses relating to our sales force  which grew in early from to persons  and additional marketing and medical education expenses relating to the promotion of angiomax  and certain non cash stock compensation recorded in connection with options granted to non employees 
non cash stock compensation 
we amortize the deferred stock compensation that was recorded in over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options 
we recorded amortization expense for the deferred compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amortization expense is included in our operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
in may we granted options to a non employee consultant to purchase  shares of common stock 
in september  we amended the terms of fully vested options to purchase  shares of common stock that were granted to a non employee consultant in may in connection with these actions  we recorded million in related non cash stock compensation expense during the unvested options granted in may will be revalued  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  and expensed over the remaining five months of the one year vesting term 
in  we accelerated the vesting of stock options held by terminated employees in connection with their termination agreements  which resulted in million in non cash compensation expense 
non cash compensation expense is included in our operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
other income and expense 
interest income increased over to million for  from million for the increase in interest income of million was primarily due to higher cash and available for sale securities balances attributable to our public offerings in and  offset in part by lower available interest rates on securities 
for  interest income was attributable to the investment of the remaining proceeds of our sales of shares of common stock in a private placement in may and in a public offering in we had no interest expense in as there were no borrowings during this period 
we had interest expense of  during associated with the draw down of our revolving line of credit at the end of march we terminated the revolving line of credit in august liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
since our inception  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of common and preferred stock  sales of convertible promissory notes and warrants  interest income and revenues from sales of angiomax 
in the last five consecutive quarters  as we have generated increasing sales of angiomax  we have been profitable 
in  we achieved profitability on an annual basis for the first time 
we had million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of december  in august and september  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering 
since our initial public offering  we have received an additional million in net proceeds in may from the sale of million shares of our common stock in a private placement  million in net proceeds in june from the sale of million shares of our common stock in a public offering and million in net proceeds in march from the sale of million shares of our common stock in a public offering 
prior to our initial public offering  we had received net proceeds of million from the private placement of equity securities  primarily redeemable convertible preferred stock  and million from the issuance of convertible notes and warrants 
in  employees and a consultant purchased stock pursuant to option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with nycomed  under which nycomed serves as the exclusive distributor of angiox in countries in the european union other than greece  portugal and spain 
under the agreement nycomed paid us an initial non refundable fee of million and milestone payments of million based on regulatory approvals in europe 
in addition  nycomed purchased  shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately million 
cash flows 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million as of december  our major uses of cash during include net cash used in investing activities of million  which was partially offset by million in net cash provided by financing activities and million in net cash provided by operations 
we had million in net cash provided by operating activities during this consisted primarily of net income of million  an increase of million in accounts payable  an increase of million in accrued expenses  mainly attributable to higher clinical trial and royalty costs  an increase of approximately million in non cash items  including amortization of premium and discounts on available for sale securities  non cash stock compensation expense and depreciation  and an increase of million in deferred revenue from the nycomed milestone payment based upon regulatory approval in europe 
cash was used in operations to fund an increase in inventory of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in prepaid expenses of million  mainly attributable to prepayment of insurance premiums 
during  we used million in net cash in investing activities  which consisted principally of the purchase of million of available for sale securities and purchases of million of fixed assets  mostly related to our leasehold improvements  offset by million in proceeds from the maturation and sale of available for sale securities 
cash provided by financing activities in reflected million consisted of net proceeds to us related to purchases of stock by our employees and a consultant pursuant to option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan 
funding requirements 
we expect to devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts and to our sales  marketing and manufacturing programs associated with the commercialization of our products 
our funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including the extent to which angiomax is commercially successful  the extent to which our international partners  including nycomed  are commercially successful  the progress  level and timing of our research and development activities related to our clinical trials with respect to angiomax  clevelox and cangrelor  the cost and outcomes of regulatory reviews  the continuation or termination of third party manufacturing or sales and marketing arrangements  the cost and effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  the status of competitive products  our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights  and the establishment of additional strategic or licensing arrangements with other companies or acquisitions 
we believe  based on our operating plan as of the date of this annual report  which includes anticipated revenues from angiomax and angiox and interest income  that our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities are sufficient to fund our operations into and beyond  without requiring us to obtain external financing 
we expect  however  to periodically assess our financing alternatives and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to slower than anticipated revenues from angiomax or otherwise  or if we acquire additional product candidates  or if we otherwise believe that raising additional capital would be in our interests and the interests of our stockholders  we may sell equity or debt securities or seek financing through other arrangements 
any sale of equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders  and debt financing may involve covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures 
we cannot be certain that public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we seek to raise funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties  we may be required to relinquish rights to products  product candidates or technologies that we would not otherwise relinquish or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations include commitments and estimated purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business 
these include commitments related to purchases of inventory of our products  research and development service agreements  operating leases and selling  general and administrative obligations 
future estimated contractual obligations as of december  are contractual obligations later years total inventory related commitments research and development operating leases selling  general and administrative total contractual obligations included above in inventory related commitments are non cancellable commitments to make payments to ucb bioproducts of a total of million during for angiomax bulk drug substance to be produced using the chemilog process and million in related filling  finishing and packaging commitments through we also have million of estimated contractual obligations for research and development activities  of which million is non cancellable 
the amounts included in selling  general and administrative obligations are primarily related to non cancelable consulting arrangements  of which million is non cancelable 
in addition to the contractual obligations above  we have agreed to make payments upon the achievement of sales and regulatory milestones  and agreed to pay royalties  to biogen idec  inc and to astrazeneca ab under our product license agreements for angiomax  clevelox and cangrelor 
under the angiomax license  we have agreed to pay up to an additional million upon the first commercial sales of angiomax for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction in the united states and europe 
under the clevelox license  we have agreed to pay up to an additional million upon reaching certain regulatory milestones 
under the cangrelor license  we have made an upfront payment and will provide milestone payments upon regulatory approval in major markets 
the foregoing amounts do not include royalties that we may also have to pay 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein regarding our strategy  future operations  financial position  future revenues  projected costs  prospects  plans and objectives of management  other than statements of historical facts  are forward looking statements 
the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  may  plans  projects  will  would and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements  although not all forward looking statements contain these identifying words 
we cannot guarantee that we actually will achieve the plans  intentions or expectations expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results  levels of activity  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements we make 
these important factors include our critical accounting estimates and the risk factors set forth below 
although we may elect to update forward looking statements in the future  we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so  even if our estimates change  and readers should not rely on those forward looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this annual report 
factors that may affect future results investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could fall 
risks related to our financial results we have a history of net losses and may not maintain profitability on an annual basis except for our most recently completed year  we have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products  including costs and expenses associated with clinical trials  regulatory approvals and commercialization 
although we have achieved profitability in five consecutive quarters  we will likely need to generate significantly greater revenues to maintain profitability in light of our planned expenditures 
we remain unsure as to whether we will remain profitable for any substantial period of time 
if we fail to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  the market price of our common stock may decline 
our business is very dependent on the commercial success of angiomax angiomax is our only commercial product and  we expect  will account for almost all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
the commercial success of angiomax will depend upon its continued acceptance by regulators  physicians  patients and other key decision makers as a safe  therapeutic and cost effective alternative to heparin and other products used in current practice or currently being developed  our ability to expand the indications for which we can market angiomax  and our ability to market angiomax in countries outside of the united states  or to the extent to which our international distribution partners are successful in marketing angiox 
if angiomax is not commercially successful  we will have to find additional sources of funding or curtail or cease operations 
our revenues are substantially dependent on a limited number of wholesalers and international distribution partners to which we sell angiomax  and such revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the buying patterns of these wholesalers and distribution partners we sell angiomax primarily to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the united states and several international distribution partners 
during  revenues from the sale of angiomax to our three largest us wholesalers totaled nearly of our net revenues and sales to one of our international partners totaled nearly of our net revenue 
our reliance on a small number of wholesalers and distribution partners could cause our revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the buying patterns of these wholesalers and distribution partners 
in addition  if any of these wholesalers or international partners fails to pay us on a timely basis or at all  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
failure to achieve our revenue targets or raise additional funds in the future may require us to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned activities we will need to generate significantly greater revenues to maintain profitability on an annual basis 
the product development  including clinical trials  manufacturing development and regulatory approvals  of angiomax for additional indications  clevelox and cangrelor  and the acquisition and development of additional product candidates by us will require a commitment of substantial funds 
our future funding requirements  which may be significantly greater than we expect  depend upon many factors  including the extent to which angiomax is commercially successful  the extent to which our international distribution partners  including nycomed  are commercially successful  the progress  level and timing of our research and development activities related to our clinical trials with respect to angiomax  clevelox and cangrelor  the cost and outcomes of regulatory submissions and reviews  packaging approval for angiox from the european authorities  and pricing reimbursement approvals in individual european countries  on a timely basis  the continuation or termination of third party manufacturing or sales and marketing arrangements  the cost and effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  the status of competitive products  our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights  and the establishment of additional strategic or licensing arrangements with other companies  or acquisitions 
as of the date of this annual report  we believe  based on our current operating plan  which includes anticipated revenues from angiomax and interest income  that our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities are sufficient to fund our operations into and beyond without requiring us to obtain external financing 
however  if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to slower than anticipated sales of angiomax or otherwise  or if we acquire additional product candidates  or if we otherwise believe that raising additional capital would be in our interests and the interests of our stockholders  we may sell equity or debt securities or seek financing through other arrangements 
any sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders  and debt financing may involve covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures 
we cannot be certain that public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we seek to raise funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties  we may be required to relinquish rights to products  product candidates or technologies that we would not otherwise relinquish or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
fluctuations in our operating results could affect the price of our common stock our operating results may vary from period to period based on factors including the amount and timing of sales of angiomax  the availability and timely delivery of a sufficient supply of angiomax  the timing and expenses of clinical trials  announcements regarding clinical trial results and product introductions by us or our competitors  the availability and timing of third party reimbursement  including in europe  and the timing of regulatory approvals 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors as a result of these or other factors  the trading price of our common stock will likely decrease 
our stock price has been and may in the future be volatile 
this volatility may make it difficult for you to sell common stock when you want or at attractive prices our common stock has been and in the future may be subject to substantial price volatility 
from january  to december   the closing price of our common stock ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
the value of your investment could decline due to the effect of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in valuations of similar companies  variations in our quarterly operating results  acquisitions and strategic partnerships  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  disclosure of results of clinical testing or regulatory proceedings by us or our competitors  the timing  amount and receipt of revenue from sales of our products and margins on sales of our products  governmental regulation and approvals  developments in patent rights or other proprietary rights  changes in our management  and general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of biotechnology companies have been highly volatile 
moreover  broad market and industry fluctuations that are not within our control may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
you must be willing to bear the risk of fluctuations in the price of our common stock and the risk that the value of your investment in our securities could decline 
risks related to commercialization angiomax may compete with all categories of anticoagulant drugs  which may limit the use of angiomax because each category of anticoagulant drug acts on different components of the clotting process  we believe that there will be continued clinical work to determine the best combination of drugs for clinical use 
we recognize that angiomax may compete with other anticoagulant drugs to the extent angiomax and any of these anticoagulant drugs are approved for the same indication 
in addition  other anticoagulant drugs may compete with angiomax for the use of hospital financial resources 
for example  many us hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for the angioplasties and other treatment therapies they perform 
because this amount is not based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs  hospitals may choose to use either angiomax or other anticoagulant drugs  but not necessarily several of the drugs together 
because the market for thrombin inhibitors is competitive  our product may not obtain widespread use we have positioned angiomax as a replacement for heparin  which is a widely used  inexpensive  generic drug used in patients with arterial thrombosis 
because heparin is inexpensive and has been widely used for many years  physicians and medical decision makers may be hesitant to adopt angiomax 
in addition  due to the high incidence and severity of cardiovascular diseases  competition in the market for thrombin inhibitors is intense and growing 
there are a number of direct and indirect thrombin inhibitors currently on the market  awaiting regulatory approval and in development  including orally administered agents 
the thrombin inhibitors on the market include products for use in the treatment of patients with a clinical condition known as hit hitts  patients with unstable angina and patients with deep vein thrombosis 
we face substantial competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do our industry is highly competitive 
our success will depend on our ability to acquire and develop products and apply technology  and our ability to establish and maintain markets for our products 
potential competitors in the united states and other countries include major pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience  and greater manufacturing  marketing and financial resources  than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may develop or license products or other novel technologies that are more effective  safer  more convenient or less costly than existing products or technologies or products or technologies that are being developed by us or may obtain regulatory approvals for products more rapidly than we are able 
technological development by others may render our products or product candidates noncompetitive 
we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining technological competitiveness 
near term growth in our sales of angiomax is dependent on continued physician acceptance of angiomax clinical data in the fall of  we completed a  patient post marketing phase b clinical trial of angiomax in coronary angioplasty called replace in november  the principal investigators of the clinical trial announced that  based on day patient follow up results  angiomax met all of the primary and secondary objectives of the trial 
in march  we released the results of the detailed cost analysis study to examine per patient total hospital resource consumption at us clinical trial sites 
in september  the principal investigators of the clinical trial announced that  based on six month patient follow up results  angiomax again met all of the primary and secondary objectives of the trial 
in november  the principal investigators presented one year follow up mortality data from the trial  which confirmed the day and six month mortality results 
we believe that the near term commercial success of angiomax will depend upon the extent to which physicians  patients and other key decision makers accept the results of the replace trial 
since the original results were announced  additional hospitals have granted angiomax formulary approval and hospital demand for the product has increased 
we cannot be certain  however  that these trends will continue 
some commentators have challenged various aspects of the trial design of replace  the conduct of the study and the analysis and interpretation of the results from the study  including how we define bleeding and the clinical relevance of types of ischemic events 
in addition  in may  we received a non approvable letter from the fda relating to a supplemental new drug application  which had sought an amended label for angiomax in order to include  among other trial results  the replace data 
the fda stated that  because in its view there were deficiencies in the study methods used and in the analysis of the clinical data we submitted  it could not approve the proposed label changes without data from additional studies 
if physicians  patients and other key decision makers do not accept the trial results  as a result of these commentators  the fda or otherwise  adoption of angiomax may suffer  and our business will be materially adversely affected 
our ability to generate future revenue from products will be affected by reimbursement and drug pricing acceptable levels of reimbursement of drug treatments by government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize  and attract collaborative partners to invest in the development of  product candidates 
we cannot be sure that reimbursement in the united states or elsewhere will be available for any products we may develop or  if already available  will not be decreased in the future 
if reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels  we may not be able to commercialize our products  and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our products 
in certain countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and the level of reimbursement are subject to governmental control 
in some countries  it can take an extended period of time to establish and obtain reimbursement  and reimbursement approval may be required at the individual patient level  which can lead to further delays 
in addition  in some countries  it can take an extended period of time to collect payment even after reimbursement has been established 
third party payers increasingly are challenging prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the changes in health insurance programs  as well as legislative proposals  may result in lower prices for pharmaceutical products  including any products that may be offered by us 
cost cutting measures that health care providers are instituting  and the effect of any health care reform  could materially adversely affect our ability to sell any products that are successfully developed by us and approved by regulators 
moreover  we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
we could be exposed to significant liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs and adequate levels or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human healthcare products 
product liability claims might be made by patients in clinical trials  consumers  health care providers or pharmaceutical companies or others that sell our products 
these claims may be made even with respect to those products that are manufactured in licensed and regulated facilities or otherwise possess regulatory approval for commercial sale 
these claims could expose us to significant liabilities that could prevent or interfere with the development or commercialization of our products 
product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant damages 
as of the date of this annual report  we are covered  with respect to our commercial sales and our clinical trials  by products liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and million annually in the aggregate on a claims made basis 
this coverage may not be adequate to cover any product liability claims 
as we commercialize our products  we may wish to increase our product liability insurance 
product liability coverage is expensive 
in the future  we may not be able to maintain or obtain such product liability insurance on reasonable terms  at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability claims 
risks related to regulatory approval of our product candidates if we do not obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates we will not be able to market our product candidates and our ability to generate additional revenues could be materially impaired except for angiomax  which has been approved for sale in the united states for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing coronary angioplasty  and which has been approved for sale in the european union and in other countries for indications similar to that approved by the fda  we do not have a product approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market 
we must obtain approval from the fda in order to sell our product candidates in the united states and from foreign regulatory authorities in order to sell our product candidates in other countries 
securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive pre clinical and clinical data  information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product s safety and efficacy 
we must successfully complete our clinical trials and demonstrate manufacturing capability before we can file for approval to sell our products 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates  diminish our competitive advantage  and defer or decrease our receipt of revenues 
the regulatory review and approval process to obtain marketing approval for a new drug takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
this process can vary substantially based on the type  complexity  novelty and indication of the product candidate involved 
changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period  changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations  or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application 
the regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that data is insufficient for approval and require additional pre clinical  clinical or other studies 
in addition  varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre clinical and clinical testing could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate 
we cannot expand the indications for which we are marketing angiomax unless we receive fda approval for each additional indication 
failure to expand these indications will limit the size of the commercial market for angiomax in december  we received approval from the fda for the use of angiomax as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing coronary angioplasty 
one of our key objectives is to expand the indications for which angiomax is approved for marketing by the fda 
in order to market angiomax for these expanded indications  we will need to conduct appropriate clinical trials  obtain positive results from those trials and obtain fda approval for such proposed indications 
if we are unsuccessful in expanding the approved indications for the use of angiomax  the size of the commercial market for angiomax will be limited 
in july  we submitted a supplemental new drug application to the fda requesting an amended package insert for angiomax in order to expand the approved use of angiomax 
in may we received a non approvable letter from the fda relating to that supplemental new drug application 
we filed a response to the fda and are in discussions with the fda about the issues it has raised 
clinical trials of product candidates are expensive and time consuming  and the results of these trials are uncertain before we can obtain regulatory approvals to market any product for a particular indication  we will be required to complete pre clinical studies and extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product for such indication 
as of the date of this annual report  we are evaluating angiomax in the operating room for use in open vascular surgery such as cabg surgery and in the emergency department in medical conditions that require urgent treatment such as acs 
we are also studying angiomax in patients with heparin allergy and in peripheral angioplasty 
as of the date of this annual report  we are conducting a phase iii trial program in patients undergoing cardiac surgery to investigate the potential of clevelox to simplify and improve the treatment of these patients 
clinical testing is expensive  difficult to design and implement  can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome 
a failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing 
success in pre clinical testing or early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful  and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results 
we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval or commercializing our products  including our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results  and we may decide  or regulators may require us  to conduct additional clinical trials  data obtained from pre clinical testing and clinical trials may be subject to varying interpretations  which could result in the fda or other regulatory authorities deciding not to approve a product in a timely fashion  or at all  the cost of clinical trials may be greater than we currently anticipate  any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post approval commitments that render the product commercially non viable  regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site  we  or the fda  might suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  and the effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics 
the rate of completion of clinical trials depends in part upon the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments 
in particular  the patient population targeted by some of our clinical trials may be small 
delays in patient enrollment in any of our current or future clinical trials may result in increased costs and program delays 
if we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements to which we and our products are subject  our products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we could be subject to penalties the testing  manufacturing  labeling  advertising  promotion  export  and marketing  among other things  of our products  both before and after approval  are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
failure to comply with the laws administered by the fda  the european medicines agency  or other governmental authorities could result in any of the following delay in approving or refusal to approve a product  product recall or seizure  interruption of production  operating restrictions  warning letters  injunctions  criminal prosecutions  and unanticipated expenditures 
both before and after approval of a product  quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform to current good manufacturing practice regulations  or gmp 
regulatory authorities  including the fda  periodically inspect manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with gmp 
accordingly  we and our contract manufacturers will need to continue to expend time  monies  and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain gmp compliance 
risks related to our dependence on third parties for manufacturing  research and development and distribution activities we depend on single suppliers for the production of angiomax  clevelox and cangrelor bulk drug substance and different single suppliers to carry out all fill finish activities we do not manufacture any of our products and do not plan to develop any capacity to manufacture them 
as of the date of this annual report  we obtain all of our angiomax bulk drug substance from one manufacturer  ucb bioproducts  and rely on another manufacturer  ben venue laboratories  to carry out all fill finish activities for angiomax  which includes final formulation and transfer of the drug into vials where it is then freeze dried and sealed 
the terms of our agreement with ucb bioproducts require us to purchase from ucb bioproducts a substantial portion of our angiomax bulk drug product manufactured using chemilog process 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we obtain all of our clevelox bulk drug substance for use in clinical trials from one manufacturer  johnson matthey pharma services 
we will rely on a different single supplier  hospira  inc  and its proprietary formulation technology  for the manufacture of all finished clevelox product  as well as for release testing and clinical packaging 
as of the date of this annual report  we have transferred the manufacturing process for all of our cangrelor bulk drug substance to johnson matthey pharma services for scale up and manufacture for phase iii clinical trials and commercial supplies 
we will also rely on a different single supplier  baxter pharmaceutical solutions llc  for the manufacture of all finished cangrelor drug product for all phase iii clinical trials and to carry out release testing 
there are a limited number of manufacturers capable of manufacturing angiomax and clevelox 
as of the date of this annual report  we do not have alternative sources for production of bulk drug substance or to carry out fill finish activities 
in the event that ucb bioproducts  johnson matthey  hospira or ben venue is unable to carry out their respective manufacturing obligations  we may be unable to obtain alternative manufacturing  or obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis 
if we were required to transfer manufacturing processes to other third party manufacturers  we would be required to satisfy various regulatory requirements  which could cause us to experience significant delays in receiving an adequate supply of angiomax or clevelox 
any delays in the manufacturing process may adversely impact our ability to meet commercial demands for angiomax on a timely basis and supply product for clinical trials of angiomax or clevelox 
the development and commercialization of our products may be terminated or delayed  and the costs of development and commercialization may increase  if third parties on which we rely to manufacture and support the development and commercialization of our products do not fulfill their obligations our development and commercialization strategy entails entering into arrangements with corporate and academic collaborators  contract research organizations  distributors  third party manufacturers  licensors  licensees and others to conduct development work  manage or conduct our clinical trials  manufacture our products and market and sell our products outside of the united states 
we do not have the expertise or the resources to conduct such activities on our own and  as a result  are particularly dependent on third parties in most areas 
we may not be able to maintain our existing arrangements with respect to the commercialization of angiomax or establish and maintain arrangements to develop and commercialize clevelox  cangrelor or any additional product candidates or products we may acquire on terms that are acceptable to us 
any current or future arrangements for development and commercialization may not be successful 
if we are not able to establish or maintain agreements relating to angiomax  clevelox  cangrelor or any additional products we may acquire on terms that we deem favorable  our results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
third parties may not perform their obligations as expected 
the amount and timing of resources that third parties devote to developing  manufacturing and commercializing our products are not within our control 
our collaborators may develop and commercialize  either alone or with others  products and services that are similar to or competitive with the products that are the subject of the collaboration with us 
furthermore  our interests may differ from those of third parties that manufacture or commercialize our products 
our collaborators may re evaluate their priorities from time to time  including following mergers and consolidations  and change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts 
disagreements that may arise with these third parties could delay or lead to the termination of the development or commercialization of our product candidates  or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
if any third party that manufactures or supports the development or commercialization of our products breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or fails to commit sufficient resources to our collaboration or conduct its activities in a timely manner  or fails to comply with regulatory requirements  such breach  termination or failure could delay or otherwise adversely impact the development or commercialization of angiomax  clevelox  cangrelor or any additional products that we may acquire or develop  require us to seek a new collaborator or undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote unforeseen additional resources to the development or commercialization of our products  or result in the termination of the development or commercialization of our products 
use of third party manufacturers may increase the risk that we will not have appropriate supplies of our product candidates 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates or products ourselves  including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance  the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party  and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party  based on its own business priorities  at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us 
if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of angiomax  clevelox and cangrelor  it will be more difficult for us to compete effectively and develop our product candidates 
angiomax and our product candidates may compete with product candidates and products of third parties for access to manufacturing facilities 
we have inventory commitments to ucb bioproducts through the end of which are intended to mitigate the risk of inadequate supply 
if sales of angiomax were to decline  we could be required to make an allowance for excess or obsolete inventory 
our contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing  periodic  unannounced inspection by the fda and corresponding state and foreign agencies or their designees to ensure strict compliance with the fda s good manufacturing practice  regulations and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we cannot be certain that our present or future manufacturers will be able to comply with cgmp regulations and other fda regulatory requirements or similar regulatory requirements outside the united states 
we do not control compliance by our contract manufacturers with these regulations and standards 
failure of our third party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of product candidates or products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of angiomax and our product candidates 
risks related to our intellectual property a breach of any of the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to products or technology from others could cause us to lose license rights that are important to our business or subject us to claims by our licensors we license rights to products and technology that are important to our business  and we expect to enter into additional licenses in the future 
for instance  we have exclusively licensed patents and patent applications relating to angiomax from biogen idec and health research inc and relating to clevelox and cangrelor from astrazeneca 
under these agreements  we are subject to commercialization and development  sublicensing  royalty  patent prosecution and maintenance  insurance and other obligations 
any failure by us to comply with any of these obligations or any other breach by us of these license agreements could give the licensor the right to terminate the license in whole  terminate the exclusive nature of the license or bring a claim against us for damages 
any such termination or claim  particularly relating to our agreements with biogen idec and health research inc  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
even if we contest any such termination or claim and are ultimately successful  our stock price could suffer 
in addition  upon any termination of a license agreement  we may be required to license to the licensor any related intellectual property that we developed 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain patent protection for the intellectual property relating to our products  the value of our products will be adversely affected the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual issues 
our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain us and foreign patents  including defending those patents against adverse claims  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
we may not have any additional patents issued from any patent applications that we own or license 
if additional patents are granted  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  issued patents that we own or license may be challenged  narrowed  invalidated or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection we may have for our products 
changes in patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing  or in some cases not at all  and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries  neither we nor our licensors can be certain that others have not filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications 
we exclusively license us patents and patent applications and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications relating to angiomax  clevelox and cangrelor 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we exclusively license six issued us patents relating to angiomax  three issued us patents relating to clevelox and four issued us patents relating to cangrelor 
we have not yet filed any independent patent applications 
the principal us patent that covers angiomax expires in the us patent and trademark office has rejected our application for an extension of the term of the patent beyond because the application was not filed on time by our counsel 
we are exploring alternatives to extend the term of the patent  but we can provide no assurance that we will be successful 
we have entered into agreements with the counsel involved in the filing that suspend the statute of limitations on our claims against them for failing to make a timely filing 
we have entered into a similar agreement with biogen idec relating to any claims for damages and or license termination they may bring in the event that a dispute arises between us and biogen idec relating to the late filing 
we may be unable to utilize the chemilog process if ucb bioproducts breaches our agreement our agreement with ucb bioproducts for the supply of angiomax bulk drug substance requires that ucb bioproducts transfer the technology that was used to develop the chemilog process to a secondary supplier of angiomax bulk drug substance or to us or an alternate supplier at the expiration of the agreement 
if ucb bioproducts fails or is unable to transfer successfully this technology  we would be unable to employ the chemilog process to manufacture our angiomax bulk drug substance  which could cause us to experience delays in the manufacturing process and increase our manufacturing costs in the future 
if we are not able to keep our trade secrets confidential  our technology and information may be used by others to compete against us we rely significantly upon unpatented proprietary technology  information  processes and know how 
we seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and other third party contractors  as well as through other security measures 
we may not have adequate remedies for any breach by a party to these confidentiality agreements 
in addition  our competitors may learn or independently develop our trade secrets 
if our confidential information or trade secrets become publicly known  they may lose their value to us 
if we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties  it will adversely affect our business our research  development and commercialization activities  as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities  may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights 
third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad 
these third parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if successful against us  could cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators  we or they could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit 
as a result of patent infringement claims  or in order to avoid potential claims  we or our collaborators may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we could be prevented from commercializing a product  or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations  if  as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims  we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms 
this could harm our business significantly 
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
in addition to infringement claims against us  we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings  including interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office and opposition proceedings in the european patent office  regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
risks related to growth and employees if we fail to acquire and develop additional product candidates or approved products it will impair our ability to grow we have a single product approved for marketing 
in order to generate additional revenues  we intend to acquire and develop additional product candidates or approved products 
the success of this growth strategy depends upon our ability to identify  select and acquire pharmaceutical products that meet the criteria we have established 
because we neither have  nor intend to establish  internal scientific research capabilities  we are dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other researchers to sell or license product candidates to us 
we will be required to integrate any acquired products into our existing operations 
managing the development of a new product entails numerous financial and operational risks  including difficulties in attracting qualified employees to develop the product 
any product candidate we acquire will require additional research and development efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive pre clinical and or clinical testing and approval by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be safe and effective or approved by regulatory authorities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any approved products that we develop or acquire will be manufactured or produced economically  successfully commercialized  or widely accepted in the marketplace 
we have previously acquired rights to products and  after having conducted development activities  determined not to devote further resources to those products 
we cannot assure you that any additional products that we acquire will be successfully developed 
in addition  proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable acquisition is a lengthy and complex process 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  may compete with us for the acquisition of product candidates and approved products 
we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions could damage our ability to attain or maintain profitability we may acquire additional businesses and products that complement or augment our existing business 
integrating any newly acquired business or product could be expensive and time consuming 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business or product successfully or operate any acquired business profitably 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to acquire any businesses or products  which may result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness 
we may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years 
we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for the acquisition  development and commercialization activities we conduct or sponsor 
if we lose one or more of the members of our senior management  including our chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
clive a 
meanwell  or other key employees or consultants  our ability to implement successfully our business strategy could be seriously harmed 
our ability to replace these key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to acquire  develop and commercialize products successfully 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may be unable to hire  train  retain or motivate such additional personnel 
our corporate governance structure  including provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and delaware law  may prevent a change in control or management that securityholders may consider desirable section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware and our certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company or discourage a third party from attempting to take over our company 
these provisions include the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings  a classified board of directors and the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of us or a change in our management that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock or our other securities

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of change in fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in interest rates  equity prices  creditworthiness  financing  exchange rates or other factors 
our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  corporate debt and us government agency securities with maturities of less than two years  which we believe are subject to limited interest rate and credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities which had an average interest rate of approximately 
of this amount  approximately of the cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities were due on demand or within one year and had an average interest rate of approximately of 
the remaining were due within two years and had an average interest rate of approximately 
most of our transactions are conducted in us dollars 
we do have certain agreements with parties located outside the united states 
transactions under certain of these agreements are conducted in us dollars  subject to adjustment based on significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
transactions under certain other of these agreements are conducted in the local foreign currency 
if the applicable exchange rate undergoes a change of  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
