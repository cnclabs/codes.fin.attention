overview we are a regional clinical laboratory with focused market testing capabilities 
as a regional laboratory  we service the new york metropolitan area  and currently do business in most new york state counties  as well as in most of new jersey and some parts of pennsylvania and connecticut 
as a regional laboratory  we primarily offer laboratory services to physician offices in these areas with an infrastructure that includes a comprehensive logistical department  extensive phlebotomy services and phlebotomy draw stations scattered around our geographic area 
we have also developed expertise in certain focused testing areas with specific emphasis in cancer pathology and diagnostics as well as molecular diagnostics 
these services are marketed as a business unit  called genpath  which services customers outside of routine physician office testing 
we have developed certain specialized markets  such as in the areas of correctional health  substance abuse testing  fertility testing and molecular diagnostics 
testing in these areas also may be supported outside of physician offices 
during the last few years  the fundamentals of the industry have been improving 
in the cost containment era of the s  the industry was negatively impacted by the rapid growth of managed care  stringent government regulation and investigations into fraud and abuse 
these factors led to revenue and profit declines and industry consolidations  especially among commercial clinical laboratories 
as a result  fewer but larger clinical laboratories have emerged with greater economies of scale  more effective compliance with government billing regulation and other laws and a better approach to pricing their services 
these changes resulted in improved profitability 
in addition  new and emerging technologies continue to provide greater testing opportunities for clinical laboratories 
our psimedica business unit is a clinical knowledge management ckm system that uses data derived from various disparate sources to provide both administrative and clinical analysis of a population 
the source data consists of enrollment demographic data  claims data  pharmacy data  laboratory results data  and any other data that may be available 
the system uses sophisticated algorithms to cleanse and configure the data so that analysis can be comprehensive and meaningful 
the data is maintained on multiple levels of analysis enabling review of data from the global level to the granular transactional detail 
the system includes a base set of queries that provide basic functionality and allows on line real time ad hoc query capability enabling the user to customize analysis to the best needs of the organization using the system 
in addition to the basic queries provided by the system  psimedica quality indicators pqi provide comprehensive  disease state oriented queries that disclose the quality and efficiency of the care and service 
these indicators have been designed to provide the customer with standards and outcome predictors based on a medical standards basis 
we are using psimedica to market value added clinical laboratory services to bulk purchasers of clinical laboratory solutions  as well as marketing our psimedica programs to businesses such as health plans  integrated delivery networks  disease management companies  insurers  clinical trial companies and other healthcare providers that most benefit from the ability of the system to combine both clinical and administrative analysis 
careevolve  our wholly owned subsidiary  is a physician based connectivity portal 
this system provides a complex  sophisticated system for ordering laboratory services and delivering laboratory results 
the system is designed to be physician centric and to provide a highly flexible  scalable  comprehensive desktop solution for physicians to manage their day to day practice and personal needs  as well as to handle their clinical laboratory ordering and reporting 
this product has been designed to work as a platform with plug and play capability that can easily be used by other laboratories that also need a web based solution for their physician customers

we executed a strategic marketing agreement the sma in december with roche diagnostics roche to operate a joint venture for the sale and distribution of the careevolve services to laboratories throughout the country 
under the terms of the sma  roche provided funding to pay certain of the costs and expenses of operating careevolve and agreed to cause its sales personnel to exercise reasonable efforts to market and sell the careevolve services 
in return  roche was entitled to a share in any net after tax income generated by careevolve  and was granted an option to purchase up to a equity interest in careevolve and certain other rights 
in december  we executed an addendum to the sma with roche 
pursuant to the addendum  roche s rights to share in careevolve s net after tax income and to purchase up to a equity interest in careevolve were canceled 
roche did retain a right of first refusal to purchase careevolve in the event we were willing to accept such a purchase offer from a third party 
although we retain the rights to market the careevolve services in all markets including the laboratory market  roche is the sole diagnostic company manufacturer of diagnostic equipment and supplies granted the right to market the careevolve services to laboratories 
as a result of the execution of the addendum  we took a one time charge to fiscal earnings of approximately  to reflect the revised change in terms of our relationship with roche 
the charge is associated with one time technology development expenses which had been assessed to careevolve and are now our responsibility 
careevolve s monthly revenues now exceed its expenses 
to date  neither our psimedica business unit nor careevolve has produced significant revenues 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while many aspects of our business are subject to complex federal  state and local regulations  the accounting for our business is generally straightforward 
our revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low dollar transactions  and about of all our costs consist of employee compensation and benefits 
revenues are recognized at the time the services are performed and are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered including prospectively determined adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
these adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if warranted  by senior management on a monthly basis 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are correct  however  several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed under cautionary statements as well as elsewhere herein including our failure to integrate newly acquired businesses if any and the cost related to such integration 
our failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners  or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers 
adverse results from investigations of clinical laboratories by the government  which may include significant monetary damages and or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under  or future changes in  the law or regulations of clia  or those of medicare  medicaid or other federal  state or local agencies 
changes in federal  state  local and third party payor regulations or policies or in the interpretation of current regulations affecting governmental and third party reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing such as the decrease in medicare reimbursement for flow cytometry testing described above under cautionary statements 
failure to comply with the federal occupational safety and health administration requirements and the recently passed needlestick safety and prevention act 
failure to comply with hipaa  which could result in significant fines as well as substantial criminal penalties 
changes in payor mix 
failure to maintain our days sales outstanding levels 
increased competition  including price competition 
our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 
adverse litigation results 
we utilize diluted earnings per share eps on pre tax income as a performance indicator rather than the traditional eps calculation on an after tax basis 
this pre tax eps takes out the nuance of tax differences caused by large net operating loss carryforwards which create benefits which we used in the past and tax expense which we expect in the future 
the table below shows our pre tax eps on a diluted quarterly and annual basis for fiscal years and quarter ended fiscal year fy fy results of operations in thousands  except per patient data fiscal year compared to net revenues net revenues for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   this represents a increase in net revenues 
this increase is due to a increase in patients serviced and a increase in net revenue per patient 
our laboratory operations had net revenues of  in fiscal the number of patients serviced during the year ended october  was  which was greater when compared to the prior fiscal year 
net revenue per patient for the year ended october  was compared to net revenue per patient for the year ended october  of  an increase of or as a result of increases in esoteric testing 
cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended october  was  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of 
this increase is related to the increase in net revenues of 
gross profits gross profits on net revenues increased to  for the year ended october  from  for the year ended october   an increase of   primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues and the decrease in direct costs relative to the increase in net revenue 
gross profit margins in the laboratory increased to from  primarily due to the increase in net revenues and efficiencies in direct operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of  or 
this is greater than the increase in net revenues and is attributable to several factors 
bad debt expense increased to of net revenues as compared to for the twelve month period ended october  this increase in bad debt is partly attributable to an increase in our third party billing and our acquisition of new payors in new geographical regions resulting from the expansion of our oncology and esoteric testing services 
marketing expenses as a percent of net revenues increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  a result of our continued emphasis on sales and marketing in the area of oncology and esoteric testing 
in addition  we took a one time charge against earnings of approximately  that came about because of changes in an addendum we executed to our strategic marketing alliance with roche diagnostic corporation 
interest expense interest expense decreased from during the year ended october  to during the year ended october   a decrease of this decrease is due to a decline in the variable interest rates associated with our line of credit 
management believes that this trend may not continue in the future due to the continued use of our revolving line of credit to fund our expansion and growth and the increase in interest rates that may continue to occur during fiscal year net income we realized net income of  for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to  for the twelve month period ended october   an increase of 
pre tax income for the period ended october  was  as compared to  for the period ended october   an increase of  and was caused primarily by a decrease in expenses in relation to an increase in net revenues 
the provision for income taxes increased from  for the period ended october   to  for the current twelve month period 
this increase was anticipated due to the full utilization of federal and state net operating loss carry forwards during the third quarter of fiscal however  it was mitigated by other tax considerations 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues net revenues for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   this represents a increase in net revenues 
this increase is due to a increase in patients serviced and a increase in net revenue per patient 
our laboratory operations had net revenues of  in fiscal the number of patients serviced during the year ended october  was  which was greater when compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase is attributable to six new sales representatives and our ongoing marketing efforts during the current fiscal year 
net revenue per patient for the year ended october  was compared to net revenue per patient for the year ended october  of  an increase of or as a result of increases in esoteric testing 
cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended october  was  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of 
this increase is related to the increase in net revenues of 
gross profits gross profits on net revenues increased to  for the year ended october  from  for the year ended october   an increase of   primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues and the decrease in direct costs relative to the increase in net revenue

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of  or 
this increase is in line with the increase in net revenues 
however  insurance expense increased approximately  or over the prior period 
interest expense interest expense decreased from during the year ended october  to during the year ended october   a decrease of this decrease is due to a decline in the variable interest rates and a decline in the outstanding balance with the pnc line of credit utilized by the company 
management believed that this trend would not continue in the future due to the continued use of our revolving line of credit to fund our expansion and growth and the expectation that interest rates might increase during fiscal year net income we realized net income of  for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to  for the twelve month period ended october   an increase of 
pre tax income for the period ended october  was  as compared to  for the period ended october   an increase of  and was caused primarily by a decrease in expenses in relation to an increase in net revenues 
the provision for income taxes increased from for the period ended october   to  for the current twelve month period

this increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue 
cash collected over the twelve month period ended october  increased over the prior twelve month period 
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of patients comprising the client base 
we have significant receivable balances with government payors and various insurance carriers 
generally  we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables  however  we continually monitor and evaluate our client acceptance and collection procedures to minimize potential credit risks associated with our accounts receivable 
while we maintain what we believe to be an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts  there can be no assurance that our ongoing review of accounts receivable will not result in the need for additional reserves 
such additional reserves could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations
