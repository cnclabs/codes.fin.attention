item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
cautionary statement the discussion below contains forward looking statements regarding our financial condition and our results of operations that are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states  as well as projections for the future 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition associated with our product candidates  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for one of our product candidates to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the product candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate significant revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations which are not historical facts are  or may constitute  forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results 
these risks are discussed in the section entitled risk factors 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
our operating expenses are difficult to predict and will depend on several factors 
development expenses  including expenses for drug synthesis and manufacturing  preclinical testing and clinical research activities  will depend on the ongoing requirements of our drug development programs  availability of capital and direction from regulatory agencies  which are difficult to predict 
management may in some cases be able to control the timing of development expenses in part by accelerating or decelerating preclinical testing  other discovery and basic research activities and clinical trial activities  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of whether our product candidates are approved when anticipated or at all 
we have begun to incur significant selling and marketing expenses to successfully commercialize our products 
once again  management may in some cases be able to control the timing of these expenses  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of the commercial success of our products  at least initially 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our consolidated operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the prevailing market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering  developing and commercializing prescription pharmaceutical products in disease areas with significant commercial markets and unmet medical needs 
we were incorporated in october and commenced operations in march following our first substantial financing and licensing of the initial technology from unc 
we are located in durham  north carolina  adjacent to the research triangle park 
our goal is to build and commercialize a sustainable pipeline of innovative new treatments based upon our technical and scientific expertise  focusing in the ophthalmic and respiratory therapeutic areas 
our ophthalmic 
table of contents products and clinical product candidates are currently concentrated in the allergic conjunctivitis  dry eye disease  corneal wound healing and retinal disease indications 
in addition  we also have a preclinical program to treat glaucoma 
we are also working on a product candidate for the treatment of respiratory complications of cystic fibrosis and an antiplatelet product candidate that could be utilized in cardiopulmonary bypass procedures 
we have several product candidates in various stages of clinical development and various programs in preclinical development 
all of our clinical product candidates are based on proprietary technology relating to p receptors 
our most clinically advanced product candidates are py receptor agonists that target ophthalmology and respiratory conditions and diseases where current treatments are not adequate 
we have acquired the rights to market elestat and restasis in the united states under co promotion agreements with allergan  and we receive co promotion revenue based upon net sales of these products 
in january  we completed the hiring and training of our specialty sales force  at which time we began co promoting restasis for dry eye disease 
in february  we launched elestat for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis 
in the first quarter of  we emerged out of the development stage  having transformed into a commercial organization  and began receiving co promotion revenue from the commercial product sales of elestat and restasis 
previously  we devoted substantially all of our efforts to the discovery and clinical development of our product candidates as well as the establishment of strategic partnerships 
prior to  our revenues consisted of payments under our various corporate partnerships established for the development and commercialization of our products when approved 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for the next several years 
we have financed our operations through proceeds received from the sale of equity securities including private sales of preferred stock and public offerings of common stock  as well as revenues received under corporate collaborations and the co promotion of elestat and restasis 
we operate in a single business segment and do not have any foreign operations 
on june   we submitted an nda to the fda for our dry eye product candidate  and we were notified that our nda was granted a priority review on july  on december   we received an approvable letter from the fda 
since the initial submission of the nda  we have completed two additional diquafosol phase clinical trials  trials and although neither of the two additional diquafosol phase clinical trials met their primary endpoint  we plan to submit an amendment to our diquafosol nda by june  based upon the totality of data from our diquafosol clinical program  including positive data on certain secondary endpoints and analyses from the and clinical trials 
we intend to consult with allergan to determine a european regulatory filing strategy for diquafosol for the treatment of dry eye disease 
in december  we entered into an agreement with allergan to co promote elestat in the united states 
allergan records all product sales and retains all product costs and licensing rights  with the exception of primary selling  promotional and marketing activities in the united states which is our responsibility 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid allergan an up front payment and allergan pays co promotion revenue to us on us net sales of elestat 
in february  we began to receive co promotion revenue from allergan on net sales of elestat upon our launch and co promotion of elestat in the united states 
in june  we entered into a joint license  development and marketing agreement with allergan to develop and commercialize diquafosol and granted the right to co promote restasis in the united states 
under the terms of this agreement  we have received up front and milestone payments of million and may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments assuming the successful completion of all remaining milestones under this agreement 
in the third quarter of  we exercised our right to co promote restasis and diquafosol and we began co promotion activities of restasis in january allergan records all product sales and retains all product costs and licensing rights with the exception of costs for our domestic sales force which is our responsibility 
we receive co promotion revenue based upon net sales of restasis and we will receive diquafosol 
table of contents co promotion revenue for worldwide  except asia  net sales if and when the product candidate is approved by regulatory agencies 
we began receiving co promotion revenue on net sales of restasis in april in october  we entered into a study funding agreement with the cfft pursuant to which they funded the majority of the external costs of one phase trial for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in exchange for a milestone payment upon fda approval  and the possibility of a sales milestone upon the commercialization and the achievement of a certain aggregate sales volume in the first five years following product approval 
in the event of fda approval  we are obligated to pay to the cfft  over a period of five years  an amount equal to a multiple of the clinical trial costs incurred by the cfft as a development milestone payment  which is currently estimated to be approximately million 
additionally  in the event aggregate sales of the product exceed a certain level in the first five years subsequent to regulatory approval  we are obligated to pay the cfft an additional million sales milestone  payable over two years 
in december  we entered into a development  license and supply agreement with santen for the development of diquafosol for the therapeutic treatment of ocular surface diseases 
we are obligated to supply santen with its requirements of diquafosol in bulk drug substance form for all preclinical studies  clinical trials and commercial requirements at agreed upon prices 
under the agreement  we received an up front equity investment of million for shares of our stock and a milestone payment of  in addition  if all milestones are met  we could receive additional payments of up to million  as well as royalties on net sales of licensed products 
santen is developing diquafosol in japan and nine other asian countries  and is currently in phase clinical trials 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and the policies underlying these estimates on a periodic basis as situations change  and regularly discuss financial events  policies  and issues with members of our audit committee and our independent auditors 
in addition  recognition of revenue from product co promotion is affected by certain estimates and judgments made by allergan on which we rely in recording this revenue on a quarterly basis 
we routinely evaluate our estimates and policies regarding revenue recognition  taxes  clinical trial  preclinical toxicology and manufacturing liabilities 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product co promotion based on net sales for elestat and restasis  as defined in the co promotion agreements  and as reported to us by our collaborative partner  allergan 
accordingly  our co promotion revenue is based upon allergan s revenue recognition policy  other accounting policies and the underlying terms of our co promotion agreements 
allergan recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
the co promotion agreements provide for gross sales to be reduced by estimates of sales returns  credits and allowances  normal trade and cash discounts  managed care sales rebates and other allocated costs as defined in the agreements 
we also reduce gross sales for incentive programs we manage  estimating the proportion of sales that are subject to such incentive programs and reducing revenue appropriately 
under the elestat co promotion agreement  we are obligated to meet predetermined minimum annual net sales performance levels 
if the annual minimum is not satisfied  we record a reduced percentage of net sales based upon our level of achievement of predetermined calendar year net sales target levels 
amounts contractually due from allergan in excess of recorded co promotion revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
we recognize milestone revenue under our collaborative research and development agreements when we have performed services under such agreements or when we or our collaborative partner has met a contractual milestone triggering a payment to us 
non refundable fees received at the initiation of collaborative agreements for which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of ongoing research and clinical development commitment 
we are also entitled to receive milestone 
table of contents payments under our collaborative research and development agreements based upon achievement of development milestones by us or our collaborative partners 
we recognize milestone payments as revenues ratably over the period of our research and development commitment 
the recognition period begins at the date the milestone is achieved and acknowledged by the collaborative partner  which is generally at the date payment is received from the collaborative partner  and ends on the date that we have fulfilled our research and development commitment 
this period is based on estimates by management and the progress towards milestones in our collaborative agreements 
the estimate is subject to revision as our development efforts progress and we gain knowledge regarding required additional development 
revisions in the commitment period are made in the period that the facts related to the change first become known 
this may cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period 
taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  against all potential tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
liabilities we generally enter into contractual agreements with third party vendors to provide clinical  preclinical toxicology  manufacturing  research and other services in the ordinary course of business 
many of these contracts are subject to milestone based invoicing and the contract could be conducted over an extended period of time 
we record liabilities under these contractual commitments when we determine an obligation has been incurred  regardless of the timing of the invoice 
we monitor all significant research and development  manufacturing  promotion and marketing and other service activities and the related progression of work for these activities 
we estimate the underlying obligation for each activity based upon our estimate of the amount of work performed and compare the estimated obligation against the amount that has been invoiced 
because of the nature of contracts and related delay in the contract s invoicing  the obligation to these vendors may be based upon management s estimate of the underlying obligation 
we record the larger of our estimated obligation or invoiced amounts for completed service 
in all cases  actual results may differ from our estimate

impact of inflation although it is difficult to predict the impact of inflation on our costs and revenues in connection with our products  we do not anticipate that inflation will materially impact our costs of operation or the profitability of our products when marketed 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues our revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in the change in revenue in as compared to relates to our recording co promotion revenue from elestat and restasis commercial product sales in as compared to 
table of contents collaborative revenue associated with milestone payments and amortization of deferred revenue recognized in under our collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners 
the increase in revenues  as compared to  relates primarily to our receipt of a milestone payment from our strategic partner  allergan 
fluctuations in revenue between the periods relate to fluctuations in product sales and the associated co promotion revenue we receive and the timing and magnitude of milestone payments and amortization of deferred revenue recognized under our collaborative agreements 
revenue from product co promotion relates to us net sales of elestat and restasis according to the terms of our collaborative agreements with allergan 
we began realizing co promotion revenue from elestat beginning in february  upon its launch in the united states  and recorded million of revenue from net sales of elestat in the eleven month period 
elestat continues to increase market share and to be widely accepted by patients and physicians  becoming the second most prescribed allergic conjunctivitis product in our target universe  the top highest prescribing ophthalmologists  optometrists  and allergists in each of our sales territories in the united states 
based upon weekly national prescription data from ims health for the week ending december   elestat has achieved over market share in new prescription volume and over market share in total prescriptions in our target universe 
in regards to the total united states allergic conjunctivitis market  elestat represents approximately of new prescriptions and approximately of total prescriptions for the week ending december   based on data compiled and reported by ims health 
elestat is a seasonal product with product demand mirroring seasonal trends for topical allergic conjunctivitis products whereby there is usually a large increase in sales during the spring and a lesser increase during the summer and fall 
in april  we began receiving co promotion revenue on restasis  the only fda approved treatment for dry eye disease 
restasis had significant growth in  its first full year of commercial sales  contributing approximately million to our co promotion revenue 
we anticipate that restasis will become a more significant component of our co promotion revenue in our entitled co promotion percentage of net sales of restasis will increase in april and allergan has forecasted net sales of restasis to be million in  as compared to million in net sales in our future revenue will depend on the commercial success of elestat and restasis  seasonality of sales of elestat  whether we enter additional collaboration or co promotion agreements  achieve milestones under existing or future collaboration agreements and whether we obtain regulatory approvals 
costs and expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in research and development expenses vary according to the number of programs in preclinical and clinical development and the stage of development of our clinical programs 
later stage clinical programs tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the length of the trial and the number of patients enrolled in later stage clinical trials 
the decrease in expenses  as compared to  relates to significantly decreased spending on ins intranasal and ins diagnostic  which were partially offset by increased spending on key programs in aggressive clinical and preclinical development  including expenses associated with our phase clinical trial of diquafosol  a phase clinical trial of ins respiratory  long term toxicology studies of ins respiratory and a phase clinical trial of ins ophthalmic 
in  we reclassified the ins intranasal and ins diagnostic programs to lower priority programs and correspondingly decreased the resources dedicated to them 
the increase in research and development expenses in  as compared to  was due to increased spending on our clinical programs  particularly our ins intranasal program  in which we completed a 
table of contents phase clinical trial in perennial allergic rhinitis in  and our ins ophthalmic program 
also in october  we entered into a research and development agreement with the cfft  whereby the expenses for one phase ins respiratory proof of concept clinical trial are funded by the cfft  but we also record the corresponding expenses and liabilities as the cfft incurs these costs 
if we receive fda approval for ins respiratory for the treatment of cystic fibrosis  we will be obligated to pay a development milestone  and possibly a sales milestone  to the cfft 
if we do not receive fda approval  we will have no financial obligation to the cfft  including the phase clinical trial costs the cfft is funding on our behalf 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million of contingent liabilities associated with this agreement 
research and development expenses include all direct costs  including salaries for our research and development personnel  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  sponsored research costs  clinical trial insurance  license fees and other fees and costs related to the development of product candidates 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and and from the respective project s inception are shown below and includes the percentage of overall research and development expenditures for the years listed 
in thousands year ended december  cumulative from inception october  to december  diquafosol tetrasodium ins ophthalmic ins respiratory denufosol tetrasodium ins antiplatelet ins ophthalmic denufosol tetrasodium ins intranasal denufosol tetrasodium ins diagnostic uridine triphosphate other discovery and development costs total in september  kirin terminated its license for this drug candidate 
other discovery and development costs represent all unallocated research and development costs or those costs allocated to preclinical projects 
these costs include personnel costs of our discovery programs  internal and external general research costs and other internal and external costs of other drug discovery and development programs 
our future research and development expenses will depend on the results and magnitude of our clinical  preclinical and discovery activities and requirements imposed by regulatory agencies 
accordingly  our development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in addition  if we in license or out license rights to product candidates  our development expenses may fluctuate significantly from prior periods 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and  in the increase in selling and marketing expenses in  as compared to  resulted from our first year of commercial operations  including increases in personnel  advertising and promotion expenses and other administrative costs to enable our active co promotion of restasis and elestat 

table of contents the increase in selling and marketing expenses in  as compared to  resulted from increases in personnel and other administrative costs as we began building our sales and marketing infrastructure in the fourth quarter of for the co promotion of elestat and restasis 
our selling and marketing expenses include all direct costs for our sales force and marketing programs 
our sales force expenses include training costs  salaries  fleet management and travel costs 
our marketing expenses include product management  promotion  advertising  public relations  phase clinical trial costs  physician training and continued medical education and other administrative expenses 
we have one phase clinical trial for elestat ongoing and are planning to initiate an additional phase clinical trial in in december  we began hiring territory managers and regional sales directors to provide us with national sales coverage for our ophthalmic products 
our commercial organization focuses its promotional efforts on approximately  highly prescribing ophthalmologists  optometrists and allergists in the united states 
we began co promoting restasis in january and launched elestat in february future selling and marketing expenses will depend on the level of our future commercialization activities 
we expect selling and marketing expenses will increase in periods that immediately precede and follow product launches 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel  facility and related costs for general corporate functions  including business development  finance  accounting  legal  human resources  quality compliance  facilities and information systems 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to expenses necessary to support and maintain a commercial organization  costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  as well as overall corporate growth 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to our increased development activities  building a sales and marketing infrastructure  and continuing corporate growth 
future general and administrative expenses will depend on the level of our future development and commercialization activities  however  we expect an increase in future professional fees as a result of recently filed litigation 
other income expense other income  net totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for other income fluctuates from year to year based upon fluctuations in the interest income earned on variable cash and investment balances and realized gains and losses on investments offset by interest expense on debt obligations 
the increase in other income  as compared to  is primarily the result of a write down of a strategic investment in and larger cash and investment balances as a result of stock offerings that generated net proceeds in excess of million in the increase in other income  as compared to  represents larger interest income earned on higher average cash and investment balances offset by interest expense and increased losses on our investments  including a write down on a strategic investment 
future other income will depend on our future cash and investment balances  the return on these investments  as well as levels of debt and the associated interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and public offerings of common stock 
we currently receive revenue from co promotion of elestat and restasis  but do not expect this revenue to exceed our operating expenses 
at december   we had net working capital of million  an increase of approximately million from million at december  the increase in working capital is principally due to our successful offerings of common stock in july and november  offset by the use of funds for our normal 
table of contents operating expenses 
in july  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock  which included the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  at per share 
the net proceeds  after underwriting discounts and costs in connection with the sale and distribution of the securities  were approximately million 
in november  we completed an offering of approximately million shares of common stock  which included the full exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option  at per share 
the net proceeds  after underwriting discounts and costs in connection with the sale and distribution of the securities  were approximately million 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  were million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments which are considered available for sale  reflecting a million increase of cash  cash equivalents and investment balances over those at december  our working capital requirements may fluctuate in future periods depending on many factors  including the efficiency of manufacturing processes developed on our behalf by third parties  the number  magnitude  scope and timing of our drug development programs  the costs related to the potential fda approval of diquafosol and denufosol  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and changes in regulatory requirements  the costs of obtaining patent protection for our product candidates  the timing and terms of business development activities  the rate of technological advances relevant to our operations  the timing  method and cost of the commercialization of our product candidates  the level of required administrative and legal support  the availability of capital to support product candidate development programs we pursue  the commercial potential of our products and product candidates  outcome of pending litigation  and the potential expansion of facility space 
we are targeting operating expenses of million 
this range  however  does not consider the impact of any non cash stock option expense as required under sfas no 
r issued in 
we intend to continue to offer stock options to attract and retain qualified employees and board of directors and we will be required to expense this non cash cost beginning in the third quarter of based upon stock options currently outstanding and the valuation model and assumptions consistent with quarterly calculations  we project stock option expense to be approximately million for the last half of we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated working capital requirements beyond in order for us to continue operations beyond  we will need to obtain product candidate approvals  in license commercial products  obtain additional co promotion agreements  and or raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or from other sources 
accordingly  we have the ability to sell approximately million worth of common stock under an active shelf registration statement  which we filed with the securities and exchange commission on april  however  additional funding may not be available on favorable terms from any of these sources or at all 
our ability to achieve our operating expense target range is subject to several risks including unanticipated cost overruns  the need to expand the magnitude or scope of existing development programs  the need to change the number or timing of clinical trials  unanticipated regulatory requirements  costs to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates  commercial success of our products and product candidates  unanticipated professional fees or settlements associated with pending litigation and other factors described under the risk factors located elsewhere in this report 
as part of our drug development strategy  we outsource significant amounts of our preclinical and clinical programs and the manufacture of drug substance used in those programs 
accordingly  we have entered into contractual commitments or purchase arrangements with various clinical research organizations  manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and or drug product as well as with others 
the amount of our financial commitments under these arrangements totaled approximately million at december  in addition  we have other contractual commitments outside of drug development under arrangements which totaled approximately million at december  these amounts may vary dependent upon the results of underlying studies  the completion of studies and or projects and certain other variable components that may yield a result that differs from management s estimate 
also  at december   we have future contractual commitments to pay million of lease obligations for our administrative offices  laboratory facilities and equipment 
our existing license  collaboration and sponsored research agreements may require future cash 
table of contents payments 
in the aggregate  these agreements may require payments of up to million assuming the achievement of all development milestones and up to million assuming the achievement of all sales milestones 
amounts payable by us under these agreements are uncertain and are contingent on a number of factors  including the progress of our discovery and drug development programs  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  and the commercial success of our approved products 
additionally  we are obligated to pay royalties on net sales  if any  of certain product candidates currently in our portfolio 
some of our license agreements require minimum annual license preservation fees under our existing license agreements ranging from  to  in addition  if we obtain licenses on additional product candidates in the future  or if our collaborative arrangements identify additional product candidates  our license obligations would increase 
subject to the information and qualifications included in the above paragraph  as of december   our contractual and potential obligations are as follows in thousands payment due by period contractual and potential obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum annual payments development milestone obligations sales milestone obligations total litigation on february   a purported class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina by mirco investors  llc on behalf of itself and all other similarly situated investors against us and certain of our senior officers 
the complaint alleges violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  and securities and exchange commission rule b  and focuses on statements that are claimed to be false and misleading regarding a phase clinical trial of our dry eye product candidate  diquafosol 
the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our securities during the period from june  through february  on february   a similar complaint against the same defendants was filed by richard and susan giorgino 
in addition  on march   a similar complaint against the same defendants was filed by kiah sai tan 
it is possible that additional complaints may be filed in the future 
we expect that these individual lawsuits will be consolidated into a single civil action 
we intend to defend the litigation vigorously 
as with any legal proceeding  we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of these pending lawsuits 
furthermore  we will have to incur expenses in connection with these lawsuits  which may be substantial 
in the event of an adverse outcome  our business  future results of operations  financial position and or cash flows could be materially affected 
moreover  responding to and defending the pending litigation will result in a diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of united states government and government agency obligations  money market investments  municipal notes and bonds and asset or mortgage backed securities 
our portfolio has a current average maturity of less than months  using the stated maturity or reset maturity dates associated with individual maturities as the basis for the calculation 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio  changes in the market value of investments due to changes in interest rates  the increase or decrease in realized gains and losses on investments and the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to various outstanding debt instruments 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to capital leases and other short term debt obligations 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
at december   our portfolio of available for sale investments consisted of approximately million of investments maturing within one year and approximately million of investments maturing after one year but within months 
in addition  we have million of our long term investments that are held in a restricted account that collateralizes a letter of credit with a financial institution 
additionally  we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect that our operating results  financial position or cash flows will be affected by a significant amount due to a sudden change in interest rates
