overview we are a much stronger company than we were just a few years ago with better operating units  a solid financial position  and a more disciplined culture 
on any given day  we have  dedicated associates providing high quality care and generating annual revenues totaling approximately billion 
in just a few years we have made dramatic progress in transforming us into a leading provider of eldercare services 
just for example  since the end of we have decreased our balance sheet debt from million to less than million  eliminated off balance sheet debt of million  increased our cash balance from million to million  and cut our nursing facilities patient receivables by to million and less than days sales outstanding  and substantially completed the divestiture program begun in in  we successfully delivered the profitable growth we had expected  through strong performance by all three of our principal business segments 
our ebitda for the year ended december  was million exceeding the high end of our guidance for by million 
for purposes of generally accepted accounting principles gaap  ebitda is most directly comparable to pre tax income from continuing operations of million see item for a reconciliation of ebitda to pre tax income from continuing operations and a definition of  and discussion of why we use ebitda 
we reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of cents  a increase from  despite a million refinancing charge and an increase in the shares used to compute diluted earnings per share of approximately million  primarily due to the effect of our convertible subordinated notes 
a key to our success was the focused execution of our strategic plan by our seasoned leadership team 
critical measures of our success in terms of our four core strategies are as follows strengthen and grow our nursing facilities segment revenue growth  pre tax income growth  and divested non strategic facilities  substantially completing our divestiture strategy 

table of contents accelerate the growth of our service businesses revenue growth  including from aegis and from aseracare  new aegis customers  net  growth in hospice average daily census  and new hospice locations including the acquisition of hospice usa 
lead innovation in eldercare completed construction on alzeheimer s units  and aegis freedom through functionality program added in locations 
continually re engineer our company million or drop in interest expense  and new technologies implemented to improve the documentation of resident care and to effectively manage labor costs at the local level resulting in a weighted average wage rate increase of 
revenues consistently grew quarter over quarter during we generated a increase in pre tax income from continuing operations on a increase in revenues dollars in millions qtr qtr qtr qtr total revenues change pre tax income loss from continuing operations change as further discussed in results of operations continuing operations  we strategically incurred million of costs related to the refinancing of high cost debt  primarily during the second quarter of we believe it was the right thing to do because it improved our capital structure by increasing the maturities on of our long term debt by more than five years  providing greater covenant flexibility  lowering our interest rate basis points on that layer of debt  and providing additional financing capacity and flexibility by refinancing with subordinated debt 
our solid operating and financial performance was further demonstrated by our increase in cash flows from operations to million in  from million in our cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by approximately million due to the reconsolidation of beverly funding corporation bfc 
bfc was reconsolidated in the second quarter of  as a result of the repayment of its outstanding obligations see item note transfers of financial assets 
excluding this one time impact  our cash flows from operations would have been approximately million for  a increase over our significant cash generation during enabled us to strategically invest million in capital expenditures and million for acquisitions 

table of contents we expect that our momentum in  together with diligent and focused attention to our strategic plan  will drive further profitable growth in and beyond 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the accounting policies detailed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements  and are discussed annually with the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors  because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
certain risks related to these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our revenues are derived primarily from providing long term healthcare services 
approximately of our current revenues is derived from federal and state healthcare programs primarily medicare and medicaid 
all providers participating in the medicare and medicaid programs are required to meet certain financial cost reporting requirements 
federal and state regulations generally require the submission of annual cost reports covering revenues  costs and expenses associated with the services provided to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 
annual cost reports are subject to routine audits and retroactive adjustments 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to  or by  us under these programs 
compliance with laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs is subject to government review and interpretation  as well as significant regulatory action including fines  penalties  and possible exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  under the medicare program  if the federal government makes a formal demand for reimbursement  even related to contested items  payment must be made for those items before the provider is given an opportunity to appeal and resolve the issue 
revenue assumptions and approach used 
as discussed more fully in item note  we record revenues when services are provided at standard charges  adjusted to amounts estimated to be received under governmental programs or other third party contractual arrangements based on contractual terms and historical experience 
on an annual basis  state medicaid programs may adjust their plan reimbursement rates in accordance with state specific guidelines and calculations 
in addition  our reimbursement rates are adjusted based on information we file in annual cost reports to each state 
using these state plans  and filed cost report data  we estimate rate adjustments and record revised per diem rates beginning in the period the rate adjustment would apply according to state plans 
as adjustments to recorded revenues become known or as cost reporting years are no longer subject to audits  reviews or investigations  the amounts of our revenues and receivables are revised 
our revenues are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts  and we believe adequate provision has been made to reflect any adjustments that could result from audits of cost reports 
however  due to the complexity of the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  there is at least a possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
changes in estimates related to third party receivables due to retroactive rate adjustments and cost report settlements resulted in an increase in revenues from continuing operations of approximately million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
allowance assumptions and approach used 
we record bad debt expense monthly as a percentage of revenue reflecting our historical experience 
each quarter we adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts according to the aging and payor mix of the receivables 
these adjustments are based on our weighted average collection experience by payor type  and recognize the relative risk depending on the source of the expected payment 
private pay accounts usually represent our highest collectibility risk 
in addition  specific accounts that are determined to be uncollectible due to bankruptcy  insufficient documentation  lack of third party coverage or financial resources and the like are fully reserved when such determinations are made 
we write off uncollectible accounts receivable after all collection efforts have been exhausted and we determine they 
table of contents will not be collected 
if circumstances change including  but not limited to economic downturn  higher than expected defaults or denials  reduced collections  and changes in our payor mix  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be reduced by a material amount 
for our nursing facilities segment  the aging of our receivables has improved over the past three years and our cash collections continue to be in line with  or ahead of  our generated revenues 
these factors have led to a decrease in our total provision for bad debts and a reduction in our total allowance for doubtful accounts 
the following table provides an analysis of our allowance and provision for doubtful accounts from continuing and discontinued operations at or for the years ended december dollars in thousands allowance for doubtful accounts as a of accounts receivable as a of accounts over days old provision for doubtful accounts as a of revenues sensitivity analysis 
we believe adequate provision has been made for receivables that may prove to be uncollectible 
during  our nursing facilities segment weighted average collection experience improved basis points when compared to as a result of the improved collection rates  we reduced our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately million 
however  changes in collection rates or payment patterns could affect the assumptions used to estimate the current level of allowance for doubtful accounts 
if our collection rates increase or decrease by ten basis points  the impact on pre tax income from continuing operations on the consolidated statement of operations would be approximately million 
general and professional liabilities and other insurance risks general and professional liability costs for the long term healthcare industry have become expensive and difficult to estimate 
in addition  insurance coverage for general and professional liability and certain other risks  for nursing facilities specifically and companies in general  has become increasingly difficult to obtain 
when obtained  insurance carriers are often requiring companies to significantly increase their liability retention levels and pay substantially higher premiums for reduced terms of coverage 
the majority of our workers compensation and auto liability risks are insured through loss sensitive insurance policies with affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies 
for our general and professional liabilities  we are responsible for the first dollar of each claim  up to a self insurance limit determined by the individual policies  subject to aggregate limits in certain prior policy years  and accrue liabilities for claims when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we evaluate our purchased insurance coverage for risk transfer and we exercise care in selecting companies from which we purchase insurance  including review of published ratings by recognized rating agencies  advice from national brokers and consultants and review of trade information sources 
there exists a risk that any of these insurance companies may become insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to defend  pay or reimburse us when that obligation becomes due 
in several prior policy years  losses exceed our self insurance aggregate limits 
for claims relating to these years  our insurers have assumed their obligations for defense and payment of covered claims  and we expect them to continue to meet these obligations 
although we believe the companies we have purchased insurance from are solvent  in light of the dramatic changes occurring in the insurance industry in recent years  we cannot assure you that they will remain solvent and able to fulfill their obligations 
assumptions and approach used 
our outstanding liabilities for general and professional liability risks and workers compensation risks are estimated by our independent actuaries twice a year using the most recent historical trends of data  including frequency and severity of claims  settlements and other relevant data 
on an undiscounted basis  these liabilities totaled million at december  on our financial statements  these liabilities are discounted at to their present value using actuarially determined loss payment timing patterns 
the discount rate is based upon our best estimate of the incremental borrowing rate that would be required to fund these liabilities with incremental uncollateralized debt 
we continually evaluate the discount 
table of contents rate utilized to measure our outstanding insurance liabilities 
due to changes in our capital structure and the overall interest rate environment  we decreased our discount rate from to and recorded a pre tax charge of million on these liabilities during the fourth quarter of sensitivity analysis 
a reduction in the discount rate by one half of a percentage point would have resulted in an additional pre tax charge of million for the year ended december  based on information provided by our independent actuaries  we estimate our range of discounted exposure for these liabilities to be million to million 
at december   our recorded reserves for these liabilities totaled million 
we believe adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for liabilities that may arise out of patient care and other services 
tax valuation allowance in  based upon our operating results in previous years  our reported cumulative losses  and the inherent uncertainty associated with the realization of future income  we provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
during and  our valuation allowance decreased by million and million  respectively  primarily due to the reversal of temporary differences and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  partially offset by increases in general business tax credits and state tax credits 
during  the decrease in the valuation allowance was further offset by the generation of alternative minimum tax credits 
during  our valuation allowance increased by million primarily due to the generation of net operating loss carryforwards and increases in general business tax credits and state tax credits  partially offset by the reversal of temporary differences 
assumptions and approach used 
we assess the need for  and amount of  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all  or a portion  of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income  which may be derived from future reversals of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies or future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
we believe a significant cumulative pre tax loss for the current and two preceding years is significant evidence to warrant a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
sensitivity analysis 
currently we have a million valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets and any change in net deferred tax assets resulting from the reversal of existing temporary differences  the origination of future temporary differences  and the utilization generation of net operating losses is being applied against the valuation allowance  and  therefore  does not affect the provision for income taxes 
all available evidence has been  and will continue to be  considered at least quarterly in assessing the need to maintain a full valuation allowance 
we expect to maintain a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained for the current and two preceding years  or we are able to develop and implement tax strategies enabling us to conclude it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized 
asset impairments long lived assets 
we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges from continuing operations of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

these indicators of impairment can include  but are not limited to  the following a history of operating losses  with expected future losses  changes in the regulatory environment affecting reimbursement  
table of contents decreases in cash flows or cash flow deficiencies  changes in the way an asset is used in the business  and commitment to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset 
sfas no 
assumptions and approach used 
a history of operating losses  with expected future losses  and cash flow deficiencies led to impairments in our nursing facilities segment on seven facilities in and three facilities in during  changes in the regulatory environment affecting medicare reimbursement led to a long lived asset impairment analysis on each facility within our nursing facilities segment 
these impairment analyses included estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by each facility or property  primarily over the remaining life of the primary asset  and reducing the carrying value of the asset to the estimated fair value when the total estimated undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying value of the facility or property 
in order to estimate the fair values of the nursing facilities  we used a discounted cash flow approach  supplemented by public resource information on valuations of nursing facility sales transactions by region of the country 
where the estimated undiscounted cash flows were negative  we estimated the fair values based on discounted public resource information  sales values or estimated salvage values 
sfas no 
sensitivity analysis 
in estimating the undiscounted cash flows for our nursing facilities  we primarily used our internally prepared budgets and forecast information  with certain probability adjustments  including  but not limited to  the following items medicare and medicaid funding  overhead costs  capital expenditures  and general and professional liability costs 
a change in the estimated future cash flows could change our estimated fair values resulting in additional impairments 
indefinite lived intangible assets 
we also recorded impairments of goodwill of million in as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in july  sfas no 
was issued  which established new rules on the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
assumptions and approach used 
in accordance with this standard  we performed the initial screening for potential impairments of our indefinite lived intangible assets by reporting unit as of january  we determined the estimated fair values of each reporting unit using discounted cash flow analyses  along with independent source data related to recent transactions 
based on this determination  we identified potential goodwill impairments at our former matrix segment and at care focus  a former reporting unit within our aseracare segment 
the fair values of the reporting units were derived from a five year projection of revenues and expenses plus residual value  with the resulting projected cash flows discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
the analysis was completed in the fourth quarter of  and led to the recording of goodwill impairment charges as the cumulative effect of an accounting change of million as of january   including million for matrix and million for care focus 
the outpatient therapy clinic operations and the managed care network of matrix were sold during january the care focus unit was sold in june we perform assessments of goodwill for all reporting units on an annual basis during the fourth quarter 
based on these analyses  there have been no additional impairments of goodwill since sfas no 
sensitivity analysis 
our estimated future cash flows by reporting unit would have to decline by nearly to result in additional impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets 
off balance sheet arrangements on june   million of off balance sheet medium term notes medium term notes were repaid 
these notes were obligations of beverly funding corporation bfc  a bankruptcy remote  qualifying special purpose entity  which was not consolidated with us prior to the repayment of the notes 
upon 
table of contents repayment of the medium term notes  bfc no longer had third party beneficial owners and no longer met the conditions of a qualifying special purpose entity 
therefore  during the second quarter of  bfc was reconsolidated with us see item note transfer of financial assets 
as of december   we were contingently liable for approximately million of long term debt maturing on various dates through  as well as annual interest on that debt 
these contingent liabilities principally arose from previous sales of nursing facilities 
we also guarantee certain third party operating leases 
those guarantees arose from our dispositions of leased facilities and  as of december   the underlying leases have million of minimum rental commitments remaining through the initial lease terms 
in accordance with the fasb s interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  we have recorded approximately  included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december   as the estimated fair value of our guarantees initiated in and operating results general our business consists principally of providing healthcare services  including the operation of nursing facilities  assisted living centers  hospice and home health locations and rehabilitation therapy services

acquisitions  divestitures and other 
on july   we purchased substantially all of the assets of hospice usa  llc and its affiliates  which were privately held companies providing hospice services in mississippi  alabama and tennessee  for cash of approximately million 
at the time of acquisition  hospice usa  llc and its affiliates operated hospice locations and had an additional locations under development 
the acquisition was part of our ongoing strategy to expand our service businesses 
in  we completed a full evaluation of our nursing facilities segment portfolio  which included the identification of non strategic facilities and facilities that account for a disproportionately high share of projected general and professional liability costs 
as a result of this analysis  we have divested a significant portion of our nursing facility capacity 
during the years ended december  and  we sold  closed or terminated the leases on nursing facilities  nine assisted living centers  of which nursing facilities and seven assisted living centers were part of this divestiture strategy

table of contents our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the unsolicited indication of interest in acquiring us by a group including arnold whitman  the chief executive officer of formation capital  llc and appaloosa management  lp  a new jersey based hedge fund  among others  and related actions taken by this group  including the nomination of candidates for election to our board of directors 
these actions may impact our ability to attract and retain customers  management and employees and may result in the incurrence of significant advisory fees  litigation costs and other expenses 
summary 
we currently anticipate that cash on hand  cash flows from operations and availability under our banking arrangements will be adequate to repay our debts due within one year of million  to make capital additions and improvements of approximately million  to make operating lease and other contractual obligation payments  to make selective acquisitions  including previously leased facilities and to meet working capital requirements for the twelve months ending december  our ability to make payments on  and to refinance  our indebtedness  as well as to fund planned capital expenditures  including strategic acquisitions  and research and development efforts  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
however  based on our current level of operations and anticipated cost savings and operating improvements  we believe our cash flows from operations  current cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next five years 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations  that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if cash flows from operations or availability under our existing banking arrangements fall below expectations  we may be required to utilize cash on hand  delay capital expenditures  dispose of certain assets  issue additional debt securities  or consider other alternatives to improve liquidity 
see item business risks relating to our company to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash
