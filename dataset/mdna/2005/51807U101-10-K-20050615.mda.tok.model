item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k report for the year ended march  forward looking statements 
for a discussion of the risk factors related to the company s business operations  please refer to the forward looking statements section starting at page of this report and the section entitled risk factors and factors that may affect future operating results starting at page of this report 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our revenues  inventories  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this report revenue recognition 
product sales primarily consist of card sales  sales of read write drives  and card printers 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time of shipment when shipping terms are fob shipping point  orders are placed pursuant to a pre existing sales arrangement  and there are no post shipment obligations other than warehousing under a us government subcontract or customer acceptance criteria 
where appropriate  provision is made at the time of shipment for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns 
the total amount of actual warranty costs and returns activity was  in fiscal warranty costs and return activity were immaterial in fiscal and the company s us government subcontract requires delivery into a secure vault located on company premises 
shipments are made from the vault on a shipment schedule provided by the prime contractor  which is subject to revision  but generally not subject to cancellation  at the option of the prime contractor 
at the time the cards are delivered into the vault  title to the cards is transferred to the government and all risks of ownership are transferred as well 
the prime contractor is invoiced  with payment due within thirty days  and the contract does not contain any return other than for warranty or cancellation provisions 
pursuant to the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue is recognized on delivery into the vault as the company has fulfilled its contractual obligations and the earnings process is complete 
if the company does not receive a shipment schedule for shipment of cards from the vault  revenue is deferred and recognized upon shipment from the vault 
in addition  revenue recognition for future deliveries into the vault would be affected if the us government cancels the shipment schedule through the prime contractor 
as a result  the company s revenues may fluctuate from period to period if the company does not continue to obtain shipment schedules under this subcontract or if the shipment schedules are cancelled 
in may  the emerging issues task force eitf finalized the terms of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf which provides criteria governing how to identify whether goods or services that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
deliverables are accounted for separately if they meet all of the following criteria a the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer  b the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined  and c if the arrangement includes a general right of return  delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller 
in situations where the deliverables fall within higher level literature as defined by eitf  the company applies the guidance in that higher level literature 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables 
the company adopted eitf for any new arrangements entered into after july  and now assesses all revenue arrangements against the criteria set forth in eitf the company applies the provisions of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop in applicable contracts 
revenues on time and materials contracts are recognized as services are rendered at contract labor rates plus material and other direct costs incurred 
revenues on fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs to complete the contract 
estimates of costs to complete include material  direct labor  overhead and allowable general and administrative expenses 
in circumstances where estimates of costs to complete a project cannot be reasonably estimated  but it is assured that a loss will not be incurred  the percentage of completion method based on a zero profit margin  rather than the completed contract method  is used until more precise estimates can be made 
the full amount of an estimated loss is charged to operations in the period it is determined that a loss will be realized from the performance of a contract 
for the year ended march   the company recognized approximately  of revenues based on a zero profit margin related to a long term contract 
the company had no revenues generated from this type of contract for the years ended march  and the company applies the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
revenue from the license of the company s software products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable  and  if applicable  upon acceptance when acceptance criteria are specified or upon expiration of the acceptance period 
software revenue was immaterial for the fiscal  and  respectively 
license revenue  which may consist of up front license fees and royalty payments  is recognized as revenue when earned 
the second source card manufacturing license sold in april to global investments group provides for royalty payments to the company for each card produced during the year term of the license agreement 
this is a multi element arrangement as described in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue derived from the payments will be recognized from time to time over the term of the license 
revenue will be recognized over the remaining term of the agreement beginning when operation of the factory commences 
there were no cost of license revenue recorded in fiscal  and accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that management believes recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  the company includes an expense within the tax provision in the statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets 
due to the company s recent cumulative tax loss history for the three year period ended march   income statement loss history over the previous five quarters  and the difficulty in forecasting the timing of future revenue as evidenced by the deviations in achieved revenues from expected revenues during the previous few quarters and taking into account the newness of certain customer relationships  the company determined in fiscal it was necessary to increase the valuation allowance under sfas no 
to the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
as a result  the company determined that a full valuation allowance was required to net against its deferred tax asset for fiscal and increased the existing allowance by million to million 
in addition  the company increased its a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset in the amount of million during fiscal the company s methodology for determining the realizability of its deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income  the estimated impact of future stock option deductions  and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards 
these estimates are based on near term projections and assumptions which management believes to be reasonable 
for recent prior periods through second quarter fiscal  the company had been estimating future taxable income from its core business  which assumed on going business under the us government subcontract for permanent resident cards green cards and laser visa border crossing cards and the canadian government s permanent resident card program  as well as estimated operating expenses to support that level of business  as offset by the estimated impact of future stock option deductions 
starting with fiscal  the company estimated future taxable income based upon its expectations for the current and next three years because this past core business has not proven to be as stable as the company had believed it to be and because this past core business is expected to represent an increasingly smaller part of the business 
this is because the company expects revenues from these us programs to stabilize at revenue levels lower than had been expected in the past and because the company expects new foreign business  which has fluctuated considerably quarter to quarter  to comprise a larger portion of the core business 
the company has had difficulty in the past  and expects to have continued difficulty in the future  in reliably forecasting its foreign business and the revenue to be received from it 
this  in combination with the anticipated three year cumulative tax loss for the period ended march   has resulted in the company basing its estimates of future income for these purposes to booked orders only 
as circumstances change  the company may in the future be able to revert back to estimating future revenue based upon its forecast revenues rather than only using booked orders  although the company cannot say when this will occur 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required at the end of fiscal and is still required at the end of fiscal  the company considered both the positive and negative evidence regarding its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
positive evidence included having achieved profitability for financial reporting purposes from fiscal through fiscal year other positive evidence included the level of sales and business experienced under the contract with the canadian government s permanent resident card program  prospects in italy and a middle eastern country for national identification card programs  the heightened interest in border security initiatives following the events of september   and expected future orders 
negative evidence included the company s reliance on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of its business  the uncertainty in timing of anticipated orders from customers  the impact of future stock option deductions on taxable income  and recent experience of net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused through fiscal  the financial statement loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal through fiscal  and the three years cumulative tax net operating losses through fiscal in weighing the positive and negative evidence above  the company considered the more likely than not criteria pursuant to sfas no 
as well as the risk factors related to its future business described under the subheadings dependence on vars and on a limited number of customers  lengthy sales cycles  technological change  and competition as noted in the section entitled risk factors and factors that may affect future operating results 
as described above  the company concluded that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and as a result increased the valuation allowance to be equal to the full amount of the deferred tax asset as of march  and again at march  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or that these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to adjust the amount of the valuation allowance based on future determinations of whether it is more likely than not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized 
a decrease in the valuation allowance would be recorded as an income tax benefit or a reduction of income tax expense or a credit to stockholders equity 
the company s net operating losses available to reduce future taxable income expire on various dates from fiscal through fiscal to the extent that the company generates taxable income in jurisdictions where the deferred tax asset relates to net operating losses that have been offset by a full valuation allowance  the utilization of these net operating losses would result in the reversal of the related valuation allowance 
inventories 
the company values its inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasts of product demand 
demand for read write drives can fluctuate significantly 
in order to obtain favorable pricing  purchases of certain read write drive parts are made in quantities that exceed the booked orders 
the company purchases read write drive parts for its anticipated read write drive demand and takes into consideration the order to delivery lead times of vendors and the economic purchase order quantity for such parts 
in addition  the company keeps a supply of card raw materials it deems necessary for anticipated demand 
management s analysis of the carrying value of card and read write drive inventory is performed on a quarterly basis 
with respect to inventory carrying values  the company follows the principles articulated in accounting research bulletin  chapter  inventory pricing  paragraphs through and and other authoritative guidance sab as it relates to determining the appropriate cost basis of inventory and determining whether firm  noncancelable purchase commitments should be accrued as a loss if forecasted demand is not sufficient to utilize all such committed inventory purchases 
as part of the company s quarterly excess obsolete analysis  management also determines whether lower of cost or market adjustments ie  where selling prices less certain costs are not sufficient to recover inventory carrying values are warranted  during fiscal  the company has not recorded any significant lower of cost or market adjustments other than for read write drives in the amount of about  during fiscal and  the company has not recorded any significant lower of cost or market adjustment 
in those instances where the company has recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory  management ensures that such new cost basis is reflected in the statement of operations if that inventory is subsequently sold 
the company s inventory reserves are based upon the lower of cost or market for slow moving or obsolete items 
as a result  the company believes a increase or decrease of sales would not have a material impact on such reserves 
the company is currently evaluating sfas no 
inventory costs amendment of arb no 
 chapter and does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal overview headquartered in mountain view  california  lasercard corporation formerly known as drexler technology corporation  until october  manufactures lasercard r optical memory cards  chip ready opticalsmart tm cards  and other advanced technology cards 
in addition  the company operates two wholly owned subsidiaries acquired on march   challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh  of rastede  germany  manufactures advanced technology cards  and cards more gmbh  of ratingen  germany  markets cards  system solutions  and thermal card printers 
fiscal is the first year that results of the german subsidiaries are included in the consolidated statements of operations  the german operations contributed to the consolidated company s revenue by million and net loss by million 
low production volumes for italian cie cards partially manufactured in germany had a negative impact on the results 
these acquisitions provide the company with an optical card manufacturing base to serve the european  middle eastern  african  and asian markets  supplementing the company s newly expanded manufacturing operations in california 
the company is reviewing the viability of merging cards more gmbh into challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh during the next twelve months 
in addition to using its own marketing staff in california  new york  and germany  the company utilizes value added reseller var companies and card distribution licensees for the development of markets and applications for lasercard products 
product sales to vars and licensees consist primarily of the company s optical memory cards and optical card read write drives 
the company also offers for sale  its customized software applications and add on peripherals made by other companies such as equipment for adding a digitized photo  fingerprint  hand template  or signature to the cards 
these peripherals have not generated material revenue for the company but have demonstrated various system options 
the vars licensees may add application software  personal computers  and other peripherals  and then resell these products integrated into data systems 
the company is continuing its efforts to recruit new vars and eliminate nonproductive vars 
major near term growth potential for lasercard optical memory cards are in government sponsored identification programs in several countries 
since governmental card programs typically rely on policy making  which in turn is subject to technical requirements  budget approvals  and political considerations  there is no assurance that these programs will be implemented as expected or that they will include optical cards 
objectives for long term revenue growth include broaden the optical memory om products range to address lower end applications characterized by higher price sensitivity  diversify om products into  and effectively penetrate  industrial and commercial markets  expand hardware product offering to address new markets and add value to current offering  increase om product revenues by selling more application software and integrated solutions  such as personalization and kiosk systems 
lasercard corporation external revenue sourced in the united states totaled approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal external revenue sourced in germany by the german subsidiaries totaled approximately million for fiscal  the first year that results of the german subsidiaries are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenues sourced in the united states are generally to a small number of government customers located throughout the world  while revenues sourced in germany are mainly for a relatively large number of commercial customers 
the largest purchaser of lasercard products is anteon international corporation anteon  a value added reseller var of the company 
anteon is the government contractor for lasercard product sales to the us department of homeland security dhs  us department of state dos  us department of defense dod  and the government of canada 
under government contracts with anteon  the dhs purchases green cards and dos laservisa bccs  the dod purchases automated manifest system cards  and the canadian government purchases permanent resident cards 
encompassing all of these programs  the company s product sales to anteon represented  and of the total revenues for fiscal  and another unaffiliated var  laser memory card spa of italy  accounted for and of the company s total revenues for fiscal and for programs in italy and senegal 
revenues for the major government programs are shown below as a percentage of total revenues fiscal year united states green cards and laser visa bccs canadian permanent resident cards italian carta d identita elettronica cie cards for the government of italy  the company has received orders for cie cards carta d identita elettronica and anticipates orders for a new program for the pse cards permesso di soggiorno elettronico 
as of march   the company had no backlog for these programs 
the company has delivered about million cards for the experimental phases and of the cie card program 
the italian parliament has enacted a law that moves this program into full implementation requiring the issuance of cie cards beginning january the pse card program was also included in the legislation 
the company anticipates orders for these programs this calendar year in preparation for the full implementation 
according to program descriptions released by the italian government  cie card orders could potentially reach to million cards per year when fully implemented 
the company s current five year us government subcontract  as extended in may  for green cards and laser visa bccs was announced in june and will expire on november  but is expected to be extended or replaced with a new contract 
this subcontract was received by the company through anteon  a lasercard var that is a us government prime contractor  under a competitively bid  government procurement contract 
the company believes that a new contract will be issued before the expiration of the anticipated extension of the current contract 
us laser visa border crossing cards bccs and us permanent resident cards green cards for the us department of homeland security dhs are an important part of the company s revenue base 
therefore  when orders were delayed at the beginning of fiscal while new artwork for the cards was being designed by dhs and when the us government decided to decrease the number of cards they hold in their safety stock  the company s revenues and profits suffered 
for these programs  the company recorded card revenues of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the company believes that inventory levels have declined to the level desired by the government and revenue levels will increase to the governments rate of card personalization 
subsequent to our fiscal year ended march   the company received orders totaling million comprised of million for green cards with deliveries from april through january and million for bccs with deliveries from may through october this represents an million annualized run rate for the two programs assuming subsequent orders are continuous and at the same delivery rate 
at march   between the us government s own on site inventory and the inventory the us government owns and maintains in its vault on company premises  the us government has inventories of laser visa bccs which would last approximately seven months and green cards which would last approximately eight months at the us government s trailing twelve month card personalization rates 
the company believes that the us government wants to maintain an inventory which would last approximately months 
over the past twelve months  the us government has personalized million of cards valued at the company s selling price for the two programs 
in  the company began shipments under a subcontract for canada s new permanent resident cards 
cumulative shipments totaled million as of march  the backlog at that time was  deliverable through july subsequent to year end  the company received an order in the amount of million which calls for deliveries over a thirteen month period beginning in july at the rate of approximately  per month 
for a secure personal identification card program in the middle east  the company has sold read write drives  most of which were shipped in the fiscal second quarter  for installation of the infrastructure required for card issuance  and also has shipped less than  optical memory cards over the past two years for testing and sample purposes 
a new prime contractor has been selected for the program as it moves into implementation with whom the company is currently negotiating a new agreement which the company anticipates successfully concluding 
the company anticipates that it will ship  to  additional optical memory cards during the first quarter of fiscal in part under its old agreement and in part under an interim order with the new prime contractor 
effective april   the company sold a second source card manufacturing license to the global investments group  based in auckland  new zealand  for card manufacturing in slovenia 
this agreement provides for payments to the company of million for year license and the initial five year training support package followed by million paid million annually for ongoing support for an additional years 
additionally  the company is to sell approximately million worth of the required manufacturing equipment and installation support for the to be built facility to provide a targeted initial manufacturing capacity of million optical cards annually 
the company has purchased approximately million worth of equipment for sale to gig  classified as equipment held for resale within the consolidated balance sheets and plans to purchase the remainder of the equipment this calendar year 
as of march   the company has received million of payments called for in the agreements  consisting of a partial payment for the equipment and installation support of million  recorded as advance payments from customers  and million for the license fee  recorded as deferred revenue  which are classified as long term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  global investments group is to pay the company royalties for each card produced during the year term of the license agreement 
start up of the global investments group facility is planned for early revenue will be recognized over the remaining term of the agreement beginning when operation of the factory commences 
the company plans to invest approximately million in additional capital equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures if and as customer orders justify the investment 
these expenditures could occur during the next twelve months  as more fully discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
revenues for the fiscal year ended march  the company s total revenues were million compared with million for fiscal and million for fiscal product revenues 
the company s total revenues for fiscal consisted of sales of optical memory cards  optical card read write drives  drive accessories  specialty cards and printers  maintenance  and other miscellaneous items 
product revenues were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal fiscal was the first year that the acquired german entities are included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the german companies had revenue of million on sales to external customers in fiscal the increase in product revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal was mainly due to revenue from the acquired german entities  a million increase in optical memory card revenues for the us government s laser visa bcc and green card programs  a million increase in optical memory card revenues for the carta d identita elettronica cie national id card program for italy  partially offset by a million decrease in read write drive revenue 
revenue on optical memory cards totaled million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal and million for fiscal optical memory card revenues for the us government s laser visa bcc and green card programs were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal optical memory card revenues for the italian government s carta d identita elettronica cie national id card program was million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and immaterial in fiscal for fiscal  revenue on read write drives  drive service  and related accessories totaled million compared with million for fiscal and million for fiscal during fiscal  the company delivered  optical memory card read write drives and biometric verification system software for a us department of homeland security program which accounts for the difference between fiscal and both fiscal and fiscal read write drives comprised of total revenues during fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal fiscal revenue on specialty cards and printers was million  the first year the company operated in this segment 
license fees and other revenues 
there were no license revenues during fiscal or fiscal fiscal license and other revenue included  representing the unamortized portion of a million nonrefundable distribution license fee received in from a licensee in asia that had committed to purchase a minimum number of optical memory cards for a program in the licensee s country 
the company recorded this fee as deferred revenue and had been amortizing it as revenue in proportion to the actual card purchases by the licensee 
during december  the company determined that  due to the licensee s failure to meet the minimum contractual purchase commitment  the licensee s distribution rights had become unenforceable and that the licensee would no longer be acting as the sole supplier for that program 
in addition  at that time the company decided it would no longer work with the licensee under the terms of the license agreement 
since there were no further obligations  the company recognized the remaining  of revenue in the quarter ended december  fiscal license and other revenue also included  relating to a payment received in january from a third party that was considering entering into a license agreement with the company  the company originally recorded this payment as deferred revenue 
the third party had subsequently foregone its rights under the agreement due to non performance and  accordingly  the company recognized revenue on this agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal effective april   the company sold a second source card manufacturing license to the global investments group  based in auckland  new zealand  for card manufacturing in slovenia discussed above in overview 
backlog as of march   the backlog for lasercard optical memory cards totaled million scheduled for delivery in fiscal  compared with million at march   and million at march  the company has only a few customers who generally place orders for a several month period so that variations in order placement from a single customer can materially affect backlog 
as of may   subsequent to year end  the company received additional orders bringing its optical memory card orders scheduled for shipment during fiscal to approximately million 
the company has no significant backlog for read write drives 
in addition  the backlog for challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh and cards more gmbh as of march  for specialty cards and printers totaled million euros approximately million and for a contract to develop a conventional non optical card production facility totaled million euros approximately million 
revenue on the contract for a conventional non optical card production facility contract is being booked on a zero profit margin basis 
therefore  the total profit under this contract will be booked at completion on or about december the million included in the march  backlog of the company s german operations for a partially completed contract for an amusement park gate system has been canceled due to the insolvency of the customer 
this does not affect the financial position of the company since we did not anticipate any gross profit or loss from the contract because it was substantially completed prior to the march  acquisition and all profit accrued to the prior entity 
in addition to cancellation of the backlog  we removed the million of deferred costs from inventory  million from deferred revenue  and million from accounts payable and accrued liabilities since the contract will not be completed and the company has been indemnified for potential losses 
gross margin gross margin on product sales was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal the decrease in gross margin on product sales for fiscal and compared with fiscal was due primarily to lower volume of optical memory card sales 
optical memory cards 
the gross margin on optical memory cards was for fiscal compared with for fiscal and for fiscal prior to fiscal  optical memory card gross margins have approximated 
optical memory card gross profit and margins can vary significantly based on average selling price  sales and production volume  mix of card types  production efficiency and yields  and changes in fixed costs 
the declines for fiscal and as compared with fiscal were primarily due to low sales and production volume and the corresponding lower absorption of fixed costs and about million for increases in overhead costs due to the introduction of cards made by a sheet lamination process that produces premium cards with selling prices from to higher than the typical roll lamination process card 
read write drives 
for fiscal  the company had a negative gross profit on read write drive sales of approximately million  compared with a fiscal gross profit on read write drive sales  including biometric system software  of approximately million and a gross margin of  compared with a negative gross profit on read write drive sales in fiscal of approximately million 
read write drives gross profits increased by  in fiscal due to the inclusion of biometric system software on a per drive basis on the  drive dhs purchase 
during fiscal  the company wrote off read write drive inventory  including costs to convert model to model q  in the amount of approximately million 
during fiscal  the company wrote off read write drive inventory totaling approximately million 
read write drive gross profit and margins can vary significantly based upon sales and production volume  changes in fixed costs  and the inclusion of optional features and software licenses on a per drive basis 
except for the large read write drive order from the us government in the third quarter of fiscal  read write drive gross profits have been negative  inclusive of fixed overhead costs  due to low sales volume 
the company anticipates that quarterly negative gross profits will continue in the future unless sales volume is sufficient to cover fixed costs 
also  unless per drive system software licenses are included in future orders  the company believes that margins will be below when sales volume is sufficient to result in positive gross profit 
specialty cards and printers 
the gross margin on specialty cards and printers was for fiscal  the first year the company operated in this segment 
income and expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the million increase for fiscal as compared with fiscal includes million from the acquired german companies  million for additional costs for legal  accounting  auditing  and the cost of compliance with assessing internal control over financial reporting mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  million for increased marketing  selling  and customer service expenditures  million on exchange rate fluctuations on debt that has subsequently been extinguished  million for occupancy costs  million for increases in investor relations expenditures  and million in other miscellaneous expenses 
the million increase for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in insurance premiums and an increase of million in legal and accounting fees 
sg a expenses for fiscal were higher than fiscal levels  mainly due to increases in accounting and legal fees related to the costs of being a public company and the acquisition and integration of two companies in germany 
the company believes that sg a expenses for fiscal will be higher than fiscal levels  mainly due to increases in marketing and selling expenses  partially offset by approximately million of expected decreased expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
research and engineering expenses r e 
the company is continuing its efforts to develop new optical memory card features and structures  including various sheet lamination card structures  the insertion of contactless chips with radio frequency rf capability  optichip tm  ovd optically variable device products  and associated media development  enhanced optical memory card read write drives and read only drives readers  and new software products in an effort to provide new products that can stimulate optical memory card sales growth 
for example  the company recently has developed a prototype of a lasercard handheld reader 
the company anticipates that these ongoing research and engineering efforts will result in new or enhanced card capabilities  production model read only drives  or drives with advanced security features and lower manufacturing costs  however  there is no assurance that such product development efforts will be successful 
these features are important for the company s existing and future optical memory card markets 
total r e expenses were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the increase in r e spending for fiscal compared with fiscal was mainly due to million in r e expenditures by the acquired german entities 
the decrease in r e spending for fiscal compared with fiscal was mainly due to the completion of the design for a new read write drive model and a million reduction related to the completion in the previous year of the amortization of design technology transfer costs 
increases in r e expenses are anticipated for fiscal for development of production model read only drives  optical memory card media development  and other card and hardware related programs 
other income and expense 
total net other income for fiscal was  of interest income 
total net other income for fiscal was  consisting of  of interest income  offset by  of expense recorded to mark to market the fair value of common stock options and warrants issued in december total other income was  of interest income for fiscal the decrease in interest income for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to the reduction in invested funds 
the decrease in interest income for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to the decline in interest rates 
income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax expense of  for fiscal and million for fiscal for fiscal  the income tax expense was million  for an effective tax rate of 
the company s income tax expense for fiscal was mainly due to alternative minimum taxes to the us government 
the payments from gig received during fiscal are recorded as income on the tax return 
this income has been offset by net operating loss carryforwards generated in previous years 
however  alternative minimum taxes are due on this income 
the company s income tax expense for fiscal was due to increasing the valuation allowance to be equal to the remaining balance of the company s deferred tax asset 
the fiscal income tax expense was not a cash item and did not mean that the company owed income taxes  but rather that it no longer could demonstrate that in the future it would likely be able to utilize the tax benefits of previously generated net operating losses 
the methodology for determining the realizability of its deferred tax asset is a critical accounting policy as described under the heading critical accounting policies 
in summary  this methodology considers positive and negative evidence regarding the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
due to the company s cumulative tax loss history for the three year period ending march   income statement loss history over the five quarters ended march   and the difficulty in forecasting the timing of future revenue which could lead to positive income on its financial statements and taxable income as evidenced by the deviations in achieved revenues from expected revenues and taking into account the newness of certain customer relationships  the company determined it was necessary to increase the valuation allowance under sfas no 
to the full amount of the deferred tax asset because its estimated future revenue taking into account only booked orders would not generate sufficient taxable income to realize any of its deferred tax assets 
if the company has taxable income in the future  any unexpired net operating loss income tax carry forward amounts will be utilized to reduce otherwise required income tax payments  and future tax expense  up to the full amount of the net deferred tax asset which is currently million 
in future years  unless the valuation allowance is reduced  should the company be profitable for income tax purposes  the company will utilize its available net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax it would otherwise owe  meaning that its federal effective tax rate will be zero except for alternative minimum taxes of 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million and a current ratio of to the company also had million in long term investments with original maturities from one year to two and one half years 
cash  short term investments  and long term investments were million at march  and million at march  net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared with cash used in operating activities of thousand for fiscal and thousand for fiscal cash increased during fiscal due to the proceeds from an equity private placement of common stock  as described below 
cash will fluctuate based upon the timing of advance payments from customers relative to shipments and the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of products
