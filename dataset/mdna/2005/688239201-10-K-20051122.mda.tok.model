stock split on july   the company s board of directors declared a two for one stock split effective august  of the company s common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of shares of common stock authorized from million to million 
all per share amounts presented in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been restated to reflect this stock split 
executive overview the company s financial performance in fiscal compared to fiscal and its expectations for its financial performance in fiscal year follow percentage increase vs 
prior year fiscal fiscal estimate sales operating income net income earnings per share assuming dilution company estimates as of november  since the onset of operation iraqi freedom in  and including throughout fiscal  the company s operating results have benefited substantially from increasing dod requirements for parts  service  armoring and remanufacturing of oshkosh defense vehicles operated in iraq 
in fiscal  the company s fire and emergency segment s operating results also improved substantially due largely to improving market conditions for each of its businesses in the segment  some market share gains and the acquisition of two businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal the financial performance in the company s commercial segment underperformed fiscal results 
the underperformance resulted from relatively flat pricing for us product lines while steel and component costs escalated and a larger operating loss in the company s european refuse business 
in the us  the company announced price increases of approximately in june and cumulative increases of approximately since april for rear discharge concrete mixers and domestic refuse product lines to seek to recover its higher steel and component costs 
due to quote to shipment lead times of up to nine months and certain existing customer contracts  the company does not expect these pricing initiatives to be realized until the second quarter of fiscal the company has also assigned a team of lean manufacturing specialists to reduce the costs for these us product lines 
as result of the operating losses in the european refuse business in fiscal and fiscal  the company is in the process of re designing certain products and restructuring manufacturing processes  among other actions  to lower its material and labor costs for the business 
this process resulted in a workforce reduction charge of million in fiscal to rightsize the company s workforce in the netherlands and to outsource certain manufacturing processes to lower cost manufacturing sites 
due to the company s actions to reduce its costs at its european refuse business  the business earned a small operating profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the company expects this business to be modestly profitable throughout fiscal because the geesink norba group had operating losses in both fiscal and fiscal  the company conducted a review for potential impairment of the goodwill recorded with respect to this business as described under critical accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company concluded in this review that such goodwill was not impaired at september   but the company will continue to monitor this investment 
the company believes that its financial performance will continue to improve in fiscal because it expects the dod s requirements for its products and services resulting from operation iraqi freedom will increase and municipal and federal funding for its fire and emergency segment products will improve 
the company also expects that its actions to raise selling prices domestically and reduce costs across all businesses in its commercial segment will substantially improve the profitability of its commercial segment in fiscal the company also anticipates that its commercial segment will benefit from strong demand for its products in fiscal due to changes in diesel engine emissions standards scheduled to be effective in january for diesel engines in the classes of chassis the company sells and or utilizes for mounting of the company s truck bodies 
when new standards became effective in  the company experienced an acceleration of purchases of trucks and truck bodies in its commercial segment immediately prior to the effective date of the new standards and lower purchases immediately following such date 
the company believes that a similar acceleration of purchases could occur in fiscal and early fiscal  with lower purchases possible beginning in the second quarter of fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal and beyond outlook and certain assumptions 
in fiscal  the company believes that its financial results will improve over expected fiscal results 
the company believes that its defense segment sales will increase in fiscal over fiscal given the duration and intensity of operation iraqi freedom and the us army s modularity initiative  which  among other things  are expected to increase the dod s requirements for the company s tactical trucks and for the remanufacturing of such trucks damaged in the conflict 
however  due to the complexities of us funding for operation iraqi freedom  the status of the federal budget overall and the unpredictable nature of military conflicts  the company cannot provide assurance that its defense segment sales will increase in fiscal the company further believes that market conditions in its fire and emergency segment will remain strong in fiscal to permit improved operating results in that segment 
the company expects its price increase and cost reduction initiatives in its commercial segment will offset the impact on profitability of any demand decreases expected in fiscal from the effects of the diesel engine emissions standards changes 
for fiscal years and  the company anticipates that the dod requirements from operation iraqi freedom will remain high  but total defense sales may decline during this period 
the company cannot reasonably expect to maintain its defense sales and operating income at the unprecedented levels of fiscal and fiscal and at the expected sales levels in fiscal and fiscal over the long term unless new military conflicts arise or the company is successful in expanding its military truck product offering 
as a result  the company expects to derive most of its sales and earnings growth  if any  after fiscal from its non defense segments and from acquisitions 
given the company s low indebtedness at september   its cash position  significant unused availability under its revolving credit facility and the company s expectations for cash flow in fiscal and fiscal  the company believes that it has substantial financial resources to maintain an active acquisition strategy in support of its growth strategy over the next three to five years 
however  the company cannot predict whether any acquisitions can be consummated at favorable prices and integrated effectively over the next few years given the uncertainties involved in targeting  negotiating and integrating acquisitions 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million of unused availability under the terms of its revolving credit facility as of september  assuming no acquisitions  the company expects its cash and cash equivalents to grow to to million at september  the company could utilize the cash to further its acquisition strategy  for stock repurchases and or to increase dividend payments to contribute to shareholder returns 
please refer to fiscal and beyond outlook and certain assumptions 
during fiscal and the first six months of fiscal  costs rose sharply for steel and component parts containing steel  and the availability of steel has at times been limited  especially for small consumers of steel  including certain of the company s suppliers 
the company uses thousands of tons of steel annually and some industry experts have estimated the increase in steel costs over this period at more than 
a surge in over the road truck sales has also created a shortage of certain components utilized by the company and resulted in periodic delays in receipt of chassis scheduled for mounting of the company s truck bodies 
although the company believes steel costs have stabilized  the company could face further steel cost increases in fiscal based on long term agreements with suppliers  the company has been able to avoid some of the impact of these cost increases  but not all the company s suppliers have been able to honor their contracts with the company 
to mitigate these increases  the company announced multiple price increases in fiscal and in fiscal  some of which take effect in fiscal  in all of its commercial and fire and emergency business units 
the new prices apply to all new orders received after their respective effective dates and the company does not anticipate being able to recover all the cost increases from customers in fiscal due to the significant amount of orders in the company s backlog prior to the effective dates of product selling price increases 
in addition  reaction to these price increases has been adverse from some customers and competitive conditions have limited  and may limit in the future  price increases and or sales volumes in some market sectors 
if steel and component cost increases resume  then the company would expect to announce further price increases as necessary 
due to the nature of its defense business  which is generally based on firm  fixed price contracts  the company is generally limited in its ability to raise prices in response to rising steel and component costs 
the company generally has firm pricing from a substantial majority of its suppliers to its defense business at the time of a contract award  but it does not expect these supply contracts to fully protect the company from steel and component cost increases in its defense segment 
the company has sought substantially higher pricing for all new defense contracts executed since the second half of fiscal to recover the higher steel and component costs experienced to date

sales in the remaining businesses in the segment rose  reflecting strong order rates for fire apparatus and higher airport product sales 
defense segment net sales increased to  million in fiscal compared to fiscal the sales increase arose from a near doubling in parts and service sales and higher sales of new and remanufactured heavy payload trucks to the dod to support operation iraqi freedom 
commercial net sales increased to  million in fiscal compared to fiscal the acquisitions of con e co and london contributed million to fiscal net sales 
concrete placement sales  other than sales by con e co and london  were up primarily due to higher unit sales volumes as industry order levels began to improve following a two year downturn and an increased mix of package sales 
package sales include a purchased chassis and a concrete mixer 
domestic refuse sales were higher due to increased shipments to large us commercial waste haulers 
european refuse sales increased in us dollars due to favorable currency translation adjustments as a result of the increased strength of the euro compared to the us dollar offset in part by lower unit volumes and lower pricing in some end markets

the acquisitions of jerrdan and bai contributed million of the sales increase in fiscal fire and emergency segment sales increased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the acquisitions of jerrdan and bai contributed million to fiscal sales

defense segment net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the sales increase arose from a more than doubling in parts and service sales and increased sales of heavy payload trucks to international customers and the dod which more than offset a million decrease in mtvr base contract sales due to a decline in the production rate under this five year contract  as the company anticipated  in advance of scheduled base contract expiration in june commercial net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal concrete placement product sales were up due to strong customer demand as us industrial markets recovered from a recession

european refuse product sales were up slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal in us dollars as changes in foreign currency exchange rates offset a decline in sales in local currency due to weak conditions in european refuse markets 
analysis of consolidated operating income three years ended september  the following table presents operating income by business segment in thousands fiscal year ended september  operating income expense fire and emergency    defense    commercial    corporate and other    consolidated    fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in income as a percentage of sales was generally due to efficiencies realized from the substantially higher sales during the period and a disproportionate increase in fire and emergency and defense sales  which generally have higher margins than the commercial segment 
fire and emergency segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the acquisitions of jerrdan and bai contributed million of the increase in operating income in fiscal operating income for the other businesses in the segment grew in fiscal compared fiscal due to higher sales and a substantially improved sales mix of custom pumpers  aerials and airport products 
defense segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the largest contributor to the increase in operating income in fiscal was the near doubling of relatively higher margin parts and service sales arising from dod requirements to support operation iraqi freedom 
substantially higher sales of relatively higher margin new and remanufactured heavy payload trucks also contributed to the increase in operating income in fiscal earnings in fiscal further benefited from cumulative life to date adjustments totaling million to increase mtvr base contract margins from to  including million related to prior year revenues 
the mtvr margin adjustments resulted from lower than expected material cost escalation and better than expected overhead absorption related to higher defense production volumes resulting from the requirements of operation iraqi freedom 
fiscal operating income benefited from million of mtvr base contract margin adjustments 
commercial segment operating income decreased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to operating income of million  or of sales  in fiscal the acquisitions of con e co and london contributed million of operating income in fiscal operating income margins were lower in fiscal principally due to an million operating loss for the company s european refuse operations  an increase of million compared to fiscal the operating loss arose from a million workforce reduction charge  lower unit volumes  lower pricing in many end markets and increased material  labor and warranty costs associated with the launch of a new geesink branded rear loader 
operating income of concrete placement and domestic refuse operations in the segment  other than con e co and london  was down in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in operating income was the result of relatively flat pricing at a time of higher steel and component costs which offset the overhead absorption benefits of higher unit volumes 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of sales in fiscal compared to of sales in fiscal such expenses as a percentage of sales declined due to cost control in a period of rapidly rising sales 
corporate operating expenses and inter segment profit eliminations increased million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increases in personnel costs related to new hires  restricted stock awards granted in late fiscal  employee termination costs and higher incentive bonuses  which more than offset a million favorable product liability settlement in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales in fiscal  largely reflecting substantially improved results from the company s defense segment 
fire and emergency segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the acquisitions of jerrdan and bai contributed million of operating income in fiscal fiscal margins were negatively impacted by rising steel costs and increased product liability and health care costs 
operating income margins in fiscal were also negatively impacted by fair value purchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions  which resulted in additional expense immediately following the acquisitions 
defense segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the largest contributor to the increase in operating income in fiscal was the increase in parts and service sales arising from dod requirements to support operation iraqi freedom

commercial segment operating income decreased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to operating income of million  or of sales  in fiscal operating income decreased in fiscal compared to the prior year in spite of a increase in sales due to losses in the company s european refuse business as industry conditions continued to deteriorate 
the company estimates that industry volume in european refuse products was down approximately from fiscal levels and that pricing was adversely impacted in most european countries 
this business also incurred costs related to headcount reductions of million and to introduce new smooth sided bodies and value priced products totaling million 
in the balance of the segment  the company s domestic businesses realized an operating income increase of approximately 
substantially higher steel costs  competitive pricing conditions and manufacturing inefficiencies adversely impacted fiscal operating income margins in the company s domestic businesses 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of sales in fiscal compared to of sales in fiscal such expenses declined as a percentage of sales due to cost control in a period of rapidly rising sales 
corporate operating expenses and inter segment profit elimination increased million to million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal from million  or of consolidated sales  for fiscal the increase was largely due to expenses incurred related to acquisition investigations and increased personnel charges

the fiscal effective income tax rate also reflects a higher effective state income tax rate due to increased earnings in higher tax states 
other miscellaneous income of million relates to foreign currency transaction gains on inter company amounts net of a million charge to write off deferred financing costs resulting from the refinancing of the company s bank credit facility in september in fiscal  other miscellaneous income included a million charge related to the early retirement of senior subordinated notes 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  net of income taxes  of million in fiscal and million in fiscal represents the company s equity interest in omfsp and in a concrete mixer and refuse packer manufacturer in mexico

financial condition fiscal year ended september  during fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at september  cash provided from operating activities of million which included million in tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million funded the acquisitions of con e co and london for million  repayments of borrowings of million  capital expenditures of million and dividends of million 
cash provided from operations during fiscal increased compared to fiscal due to the increase in net income and proportionately higher increases in customer advances  largely from the dod  than in operating assets required to support the company s fiscal sales increase 
in fiscal  inventories increased sharply to support higher sales levels  including production under the uk wheeled tanker contract 
customer advances represented a significant source of cash in fiscal due to higher performance based payments from the dod and higher advances associated with fire apparatus orders compared to prior year levels 
cash paid for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash taxes paid increased due to the higher level of earnings offset in part by increased deductions in fiscal for the tax benefits of stock option exercises and pension contributions 
at september   the company had repaid all of its revolving credit facility borrowings  with the exception of million designated as a hedge of its investment in bai 
the company s debt to total capital ratio at september  was compared to at september  fiscal year ended september  during fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at september  cash provided from operating activities of million  net borrowings of million under the company s credit facilities and proceeds of stock option exercises of million were used to acquire jerrdan and bai for million  fund capital expenditures of million  pay dividends of million and fund the million increase in other long term assets  which primarily related to increased pension contributions 
in fiscal  receivables and inventories increased to support higher sales levels 
customer advances represented a significant source of cash in fiscal due to higher performance based payments on the company s fhtv contract and higher advances associated with fire apparatus orders compared to prior year levels 
net working capital also increased million due to acquisitions 
cash paid for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash taxes paid increased due to the higher level of earnings less increased deductions in fiscal for the tax benefits of stock option exercises and pension contributions 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million of unused availability under the terms of its revolving credit facility as of september  the company s primary cash requirements include working capital  capital expenditures  dividends  interest and principal payments on indebtedness and  potentially  future acquisitions 
in september  the company obtained a new unsecured million senior revolving credit facility revolving credit facility expiring in september availability under the revolving credit facility was reduced by borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit of million at september  the company may seek to increase the revolving credit facility up to an aggregate maximum outstanding amount of million  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including the company not being in default under terms of its revolving credit facility and the identification of lenders willing to provide additional commitments 
the company expects its primary sources of cash to be cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  and borrowings from unused availability under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company s cash flow from operations has fluctuated  and will likely continue to fluctuate significantly  from quarter to quarter  due to changes in working capital requirements arising principally from seasonal fluctuations in sales  the start up or conclusion of large defense contracts and the timing of receipt of individually large performance based payments from the dod 
based upon current and anticipated future operations and excluding the impact of any potential acquisitions  the company believes that these capital resources will be adequate to meet future working capital  debt service and other capital requirements for fiscal debt levels and capital resource requirements beyond fiscal are not currently estimable because the company maintains an active acquisitions strategy and the capital requirements of this strategy cannot be reasonably estimated 
the company s revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants  including requirements that the company maintain certain financial ratios at prescribed levels  and restrictions on the ability of the company and certain of its subsidiaries to consolidate or merge  create liens  incur additional indebtedness and dispose of assets 
given the company s limited borrowings and its estimated cash flow  the company believes that it is unlikely that these restrictions and covenants would limit the company s ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments  to raise additional debt or equity capital  or to take advantage of business opportunities  including future acquisitions 
interest rates on borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility are variable and are equal to the base rate which is equal to the higher of a bank s reference rate and the federal funds rate plus or the offshore rate which is a bank s inter bank offered rate for us dollars in off shore markets plus a margin of for offshore rate loans under the company s revolving credit facility as of september  the margins are subject to adjustment  up or down  based on whether certain financial criteria are met 
the weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding at september  was 
the company presently has no plans to enter into interest rate swap arrangements to limit exposure to future increases in interest rates 
in addition to the company s revolving credit facility  the company s wholly owned subsidiary in the netherlands  geesink group bv  and certain of its affiliates are party to a million bank credit facility the euro facility which supports a cross border cash pooling arrangement 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the euro facility at september  london has a million cad million credit facility with million cad million in borrowings outstanding at september   which bears interest at a variable rate based on a bank s prime rate plus at september  
other subsidiaries of the company had other unsecured debt outstanding of million with varying interest rates at september  also  the company s owned subsidiary  bai  had outstanding mortgage loans of million million  which bear interest at a variable rate based on the three month euribor rate  plus a margin of between and

mcneilus and an unaffiliated third party  ba leasing capital corporation balcap a subsidiary of bank of america corporation  are general partners in omfsp 
each of the two general partners has identical voting  participating and protective rights and responsibilities in omfsp

omfsp purchases trucks  truck bodies and concrete batch plants for lease to user lessees 
the company sold equipment totaling million  million and million to omfsp in fiscal  and  respectively 
banks and other financial institutions lend to omfsp approximately of the purchase price of the equipment  with recourse solely to omfsp  secured by a pledge of lease payments due from the user lessees 
each partner funds one half of the approximate equity portion of the cost of the new equipment purchases 
customers provide a down payment 
each partner is allocated its proportionate share of omfsp cash flow and taxable income in accordance with the partnership agreement 
indebtedness of omfsp is secured by the underlying leases and assets of  and is with recourse to  omfsp 
however  all omfsp indebtedness is non recourse to the company and balcap 
omfsp debt financing is bid among a pool of third party banks and other financial institutions 
omfsp s available but unused borrowing capacity with such banks and other third party financial institutions was million at september  omfsp lenders do not guarantee its borrowing capacity and may withdraw such borrowing availability at any time 
should debt financing not be available to omfsp in the future  certain of the company s customers would need to find sources of lease financing other than through omfsp  which could have an adverse impact on the company s sales of equipment 
omfsp and its predecessor have operated since  with profits in each year 
omfsp seeks to maintain strict credit standards 
each general partner approves each lease financing transaction 
lessee customers guarantee the residual value with respect to each lease 
infrequently  a customer will default on a lease 
in such instances  omfsp has historically been successful in disposing of the underlying equipment at values in excess of the then residual values on the leases 
lease losses historically have not been material in any one year 
in the event that material lease losses did occur  the company believes its losses would be limited to its investment in omfsp because omfsp s debt is nonrecourse to the company

the company cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions referred to in the forward looking statements or otherwise are accurate or will prove to have been correct 
any assumptions that are inaccurate or do not prove to be correct could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to achieve the results that the forward looking statements contemplate 
fiscal and beyond outlook the company estimates that fiscal consolidated net sales will range between and billion  an increase from fiscal net sales of to 
approximately million of the estimated increase can be attributable to fiscal acquisitions 
all comparisons are to fiscal and assume no new acquisitions 
the company expects the fire and emergency segment sales growth percentage to be in the high single digits in fiscal  reflecting improving markets and higher pricing across the segment 
the company projects defense segment sales to increase to in fiscal due to additional federal funding which includes requirements for new and remanufactured trucks to meet the dod s requirements for operation iraqi freedom  while it projects defense parts and service sales to be consistent with fiscal sales 
the company estimates the commercial segment s sales growth percentage to be in the low single digits range in fiscal as higher pricing is expected to offset lower volumes 
while the company believes that industry demand for concrete mixers and refuse packers in the us in fiscal will increase to in advance of a diesel engine emissions standards change that becomes effective on january   the company is projecting a loss in market share due to its need to increase prices to recover increasing steel and component costs 
the company estimates the acquisitions of con e co and london will add million to segment sales in fiscal because fiscal results only included their operations since the dates of acquisition 
the company expects that geesink norba group refuse product sales will also be up slightly in fiscal the company is projecting consolidated operating income to be up between and in fiscal resulting in operating income of between million and million 
the company is projecting fire and emergency segment margins will be relatively flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal as start up costs related to a facility expansion at pierce are expected to offset other margin improvement initiatives 
the company is projecting defense segment operating income margins to decrease approximately basis points in fiscal as fiscal results benefited from million of mtvr base contract margin adjustments 
in the commercial segment  the company projects operating income margins to double in fiscal as a result of a pricing strategy implemented to recover steel and component costs increases experienced in fiscal and the company expects that the con e co and london acquisitions will add million to segment operating income in fiscal the company also expects its european refuse business to be modestly profitable in fiscal as a result of the restructuring of that business in fiscal and compared to an million operating loss in fiscal the company estimates that corporate operating expenses and inter segment profit eliminations will increase million to approximately million in fiscal the increase reflects higher personnel costs related to new hires and stock option expense as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r effective october  also  fiscal results benefited from a million favorable product liability settlement in the first quarter 
the company estimates that interest expense net of interest income and other expenses will decrease million to million in fiscal largely due to the repayment of the debt associated with the acquisitions in fiscal and higher interest income on higher estimated average cash balances in fiscal the company estimates that in fiscal its effective income tax rate will decrease to approximately to  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates will approximate million and minority interest in earnings will approximate million 
these estimates result in the company s estimate of fiscal net income between million and million and earnings per share between and per share 
the company expects its earnings per share to be down in the first quarter of fiscal to to per share compared to per share in the first quarter of fiscal and that about of its estimated annual earnings per share in fiscal will be realized in its second and third quarters 
by september   assuming no further acquisitions  the company expects to generate cash balances of to million that the company could utilize to further its acquisition strategy  for stock repurchases and or to increase dividend payments to contribute to shareholder returns 
the company anticipates capital spending to approximate million in fiscal in fiscal  the company believes that its financial results will improve over expected fiscal results 
the company believes that its defense segment sales will increase in fiscal over fiscal given the duration and intensity of operation iraqi freedom and the us army s modularity initiative  which  among other things  are expected to increase the dod s requirements for the company s tactical trucks and for the remanufacturing of such trucks damaged in the conflict 
however  due to the complexities of us funding for operation iraqi freedom  the status of the federal budget overall and the unpredictable nature of military conflicts  the company cannot provide assurance that its defense segment sales will increase in fiscal the company further believes that market conditions in its fire and emergency segment will remain strong in fiscal to permit improved operating results in the segment 
the company expects its price increase and cost reduction initiatives in its commercial segment will offset the impact of any demand decreases expected in fiscal from the effects of the diesel engine emissions standards changes 
for fiscal years and  the company anticipates that the dod requirements from operation iraqi freedom will remain high  but total defense sales may decline during this period 
the company cannot reasonably expect to maintain its defense sales and operating income at the unprecedented levels of fiscal and fiscal and at the expected sales levels in fiscal and fiscal over the long term unless new military conflicts arise or the company is successful in expanding its military truck product offering 
as a result  the company expects to derive most of its sales and earnings growth  if any  after fiscal from its non defense segments and from acquisitions 
given the company s low indebtedness at september   its cash position  significant unused availability under its revolving credit facility and the company s expectations for cash flow in fiscal and fiscal  the company believes that it has substantial financial resources to maintain an active acquisition strategy in support of its growth strategy over the next three to five years 
however  the company cannot predict whether any acquisitions can be consummated at favorable prices and integrated effectively over the next few years given the uncertainties involved in targeting  negotiating and integrating acquisitions 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on equipment and parts sales when contract terms are met  collectibility is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
revenue from service agreements is recognized as earned  when services have been rendered 
the company records revenues under certain long term  fixed price defense contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting  generally using either the cost to cost or units accepted method as the measurement basis for effort accomplished 
profits expected to be realized on contracts are based on management estimates of total contract sales value and costs at completion 
estimated amounts for contract changes and claims are included in contract sales only when realization is estimated to be probable 
assumptions used for recording sales and earnings are recognized as a cumulative life to date adjustment in the period of change to reflect revisions in contract value and estimated costs 
in the period in which it is determined that a loss will be incurred on a contract  the entire amount of the estimated loss is charged to cost of sales 
the complexity of the estimation process and all issues related to assumptions  risks  and uncertainties inherent with the application of the cost to cost method of accounting affect the amounts reported in the company s financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect the cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  overhead rate estimates  revised estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices  and customer specification changes 
if business conditions were different  or if the company had used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported in the financial statements 
bid and proposal costs are expensed as incurred 
in fiscal  following completion of contractually required performance testing  the company began initial deliveries of wheeled tanker systems comprised of a truck chassis and water or fuel tank trailer under a multi year requirements contract with the uk mod 
the contract  valued at million british sterling million  calls for delivery of wheeled tanker systems over a month period beginning in february the contract provides that the company is paid within days of delivery of the wheeled tanker systems to the uk mod 
the uk mod has up to days following system delivery to reject the delivered wheeled tanker systems 
wheeled tanker systems remain in the company s inventory and cash received in payment for these systems is recorded as deferred revenue until the earlier of the date that the wheeled tanker system has been accepted by the customer or the date the rejection right lapses generally days from system delivery at which time the company recognizes revenue 
sales in fiscal under this contract totaled million 
goodwill and other intangible assets in conformity with us gaap  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions 
the fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including recorded goodwill 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets become impaired 
any impairment review is  by its nature  highly judgmental as estimates of future sales  earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values 
however  the company believes that it has conducted thorough and competent valuations of its goodwill and other intangible assets annually  resulting in no impairment of goodwill 
in fiscal  the company s geesink norba group incurred an operating loss of million 
as a result of this loss and a small operating loss in fiscal  the company continues to monitor whether an impairment of the geesink norba group goodwill has occurred 
goodwill associated with the geesink norba group  which was recorded in connection with the acquisition of this business in july  totaled million as of september  million based on the exchange rate as of september  
most of the european refuse markets served by the geesink norba group have been in a recession since while experiencing a slight improvement in fiscal  the company believes that refuse collection vehicle market sales volumes in europe declined by more than from fiscal levels to fiscal levels and that pricing in several of its markets declined by to over this period 
during fiscal  the company launched a new geesink branded  smooth sided  rear loader refuse collection vehicle and the valu pak  value priced refuse collection vehicle into the european refuse market to spur demand for the company s products 
also  the company installed new moving assembly lines in its facility in the netherlands for the production of some of the major components of its refuse collection vehicles for europe with the objective of substantially reducing component production hours 
following the launch of the new geesink branded rear loader  its product cost substantially exceeded the company s estimated product cost and initial production units involved substantial warranty claims until certain design changes were made in fiscal these issues caused the geesink norba group to begin reporting operating losses in the business in the quarter ended june  the company made a management change and assigned its lean team to the business in early fiscal to resolve the product design issues and to substantially reduce the manufacturing costs of the geesink branded rear loader 
as a result of these initiatives  the company recorded a million workforce reduction charge in fiscal to rightsize its workforce in the netherlands and to commence a strategy to outsource certain activities to lower cost manufacturing sites 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal and for the first quarter since the quarter ended june   the geesink norba group earned a small operating profit 
the company believes that the business will be modestly profitable throughout fiscal and that the profitability of the business will improve sharply in fiscal following the completion of its outsourcing strategy  among other planned actions 
based largely on the company s estimated benefits of its cost reduction initiatives in fiscal  the company developed long term projections of estimated cash flows from the geesink norba group to assess the fair value of the business 
as a result  the company determined that the fair value of the geesink norba group exceeded its carrying value at september   and therefore determined that the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of the geesink norba group was not impaired 
the company intends to continue to review the results of its fiscal initiatives and to monitor the valuation of its investment in the geesink norba group as appropriate during fiscal to the extent that the geesink norba group is not able to achieve expected sales and operating income performance in fiscal and fiscal  the company could be required to record a goodwill impairment charge

warranty sales of the company s products generally carry typical explicit manufacturers warranties based on terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
the company records provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at the time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
at times  warranty issues arise which are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company provides for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that from time to time additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
product liability due to the nature of the company s products  the company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
a substantial portion of these claims and lawsuits involve the company s concrete placement and domestic refuse businesses  while such lawsuits in the company s defense and fire and emergency businesses have historically been limited 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  the company maintains insurance to reduce or eliminate risk to the company 
most insurance coverage includes self insured retentions that vary by business segment and by year 
as of september   the company maintained self insured retentions of million per claim for each of its businesses 
the company establishes product liability reserves for its self insured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and the company s ability to reasonably estimate such loss 
there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation 
the company makes estimates based on available information and the company s best judgment after consultation with appropriate experts 
the company periodically revises estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances 
the company also utilizes actuarial methodologies to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of the adverse development of claims over time 
stock based compensation as permitted under sfas no 
 the company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting to account for employee stock options and other stock based compensation programs 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of the employee stock option is equal to or greater than the market price of the company s common stock on the grant date and all other provisions of the award are fixed 
had the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation prescribed by sfas no 
been used  net earnings would have been reduced by million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
critical accounting estimates management of the company has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition the uk wheeled tanker contract provides for a series of three tests  which together comprise a production reliability acceptance test prat to be conducted over the life of the production effort 
the initial test under the prat was conducted using wheeled tanker systems delivered in july in october  the company was informed that the uk mod intended to retain of amounts due on delivered trucks until certain warranty claims are addressed 
the company believes that the warranty claims are insignificant 
the modification of the timing of the cash flows under the contract may result in certain portions of the outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of this contract to become ineffective 
at this time  the company believes that this issue will be resolved with the uk mod and that the matter will result in no material loss to the company 
the uk wheeled tanker contract provides for approximately a four percent increase to the system sales price if the company can demonstrate the equipment is electro magnetic compatible emc as defined under the terms of the contract 
the company currently believes that it has a solution to meet the emc requirements  but given the difficult nature of the requirements  the company cannot provide any assurance that its solution will be acceptable 
if the company receives the mod s acceptance of achievement of the emc requirements  then the company would be required to retrofit the wheeled tanker systems already delivered prior to recognition of revenue for the increase in the system sales price 
the company believes that achievement of emc requirements  net of expected costs  could result in incremental pre tax earnings of approximately million for wheeled tanker systems accepted as of september  the company believes that its accounting for the uk wheeled tanker contract involves a critical accounting estimate because the ultimate resolution of the prat and emc issues could lead to either a material charge or gain in fiscal or beyond depending on the outcome of the issues and the timing of resolution of such issues 
the company recorded revenues and anticipated profits under the mtvr multi year  fixed price base production contract on a percentage of completion basis  generally using units accepted as the measurement basis for effort accomplished 
estimated contract profits were taken into earnings in proportion to recorded sales based on estimated average cost determined using total contract units under order 
changes in estimated contract profits were recognized in earnings using the cumulative life to date method 
under this method  current estimated contract profits were compared with previously estimated contract profits and a cumulative life to date adjustment is recorded to income for all previously accepted units 
the company believes that the accounting estimate was a critical accounting estimate because changes in estimated costs can materially affect net income 
the estimate requires management to forecast estimated material costs on non quoted components  to estimate manufacturing overhead rates which are dependent in part on sales forecasts of non mtvr volume  to estimate contract close out costs and to estimate manufacturing hours per unit over a broad spectrum of volume  including low rate of initial production  high rate of production and ramp down production to the end of the contract 
quarterly  or upon the occurrence of a significant event impacting the contract  company management reviews actual contract performance to date to determine if there are any factors that would require an adjustment of the overall contract estimated margin 
in fiscal  and  the company increased the margin percentage recognized on the mtvr contract by  and percentage points  respectively  as a result of contract modifications and favorable cost performance compared to estimates 
the changes in estimates increased operating income by million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  or  and of consolidated operating income  respectively 
warranty the company s products generally carry explicit warranties that extend from six months to five years  based on terms that are generally accepted in the marketplace 
selected components included in the company s end products such as engines  transmissions  tires  etc 
may include manufacturers warranties 
these manufacturers warranties are generally passed on to the end customer of the company s products and the customer would generally deal directly with the component manufacturer 
the company s policy is to record a liability for the expected cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring company obligations under the warranty plans 
the company believes that the warranty accounting estimate is a critical accounting estimate because changes in the warranty provision can materially affect net income  the estimate requires management to forecast estimated product usage levels by customers  in the case of new models  components or technology  there may be a different  higher level of warranty claims experience than with existing  mature products  and certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
the estimate for warranty obligations is a critical accounting estimate for each of the company s operating segments 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts  labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit campaigns 
over the past three years  the company s warranty cost as a percentage of sales has ranged from of sales to of sales 
warranty costs tend to be higher shortly after new product introductions  especially those introductions involving new technologies  when field warranty campaigns may be necessary to correct or retrofit certain items 
accordingly  the company must make assumptions about the number and cost of anticipated field warranty campaigns 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the extent of pre production testing  the number of units involved and the extent of new features components included in new product models 
each quarter  the company reviews actual warranty claims experience to determine if there are any systemic defects that would require a field campaign 
also  based upon historical experience  warranty provision rates on new product introductions are established at higher than standard rates to reflect increased expected warranty costs associated with any new product introduction 
at times  warranty issues can arise which are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
if the estimate of warranty costs in fiscal increased or decreased by  the company s accrued warranty costs  costs of sales and operating income would each change by million  or  and  respectively 
goodwill in accordance with the company s accounting policies  goodwill is not amortized  however  it is assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering events or indicators of potential impairment occur 
indicators of potential impairment include situations involving significant adverse changes in business climate  adverse actions by regulators  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  changes in technology or markets and operating losses  among others 
the company performs its annual review in the fourth quarter of each year 
recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the implied fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
reporting units are business components one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
in making this assessment  management estimates discounted anticipated cash flows of a reporting unit based on a number of factors including historical operating results  business plans and market conditions 
rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
in fiscal  the company s geesink norba group recorded an operating loss due to continued weakening of european markets  additional production and warranty costs associated with the launch of the new geesink branded refuse rear loader and a million workforce reduction charge to rightsize the workforce in the netherlands and to outsource certain manufacturing processes to lower cost manufacturing sites 
the company had goodwill of million at september  related to the geesink norba group 
the company s fiscal review for potential impairment of this goodwill indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill at september  while any assessment of goodwill is inherently a subjective process and is dependent on projections of future operating results  the company believes that it conducted a thorough and competent valuation of the geesink norba group at september  in support of its assessment 
to the extent that the geesink norba group is not able to achieve expected sales and operating income performance in fiscal and fiscal  the company could be required to record a goodwill impairment charge 
the range of potential charge would be based on a number of factors  including the speed of the european economic recovery  the results of the company s cost reduction activities  geesink norba group s operating performance  competition  required future capital expenditures  interest rates and long term growth assumptions 
the company cannot provide any assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
see critical accounting policies 
deferred income tax assets the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets 
the company records a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount management expects to realize 
management considers  as applicable  the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
the company will require future taxable income in the netherlands in order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset in that jurisdiction 
at september   a valuation allowance has been established to reserve for the net deferred tax asset related to tax loss carryforwards in the netherlands 
benefit plans the pension benefit obligation and related pension income are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations at september  used a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
the company s other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including health care trend rates 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the annual service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point  would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by million and decrease the annual service and interest cost by million 
the company s benefit plan assumptions are determined by using a benchmark approach as well as currently available actuarial data 
new accounting standards inventory costs in november  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of sfas in the fourth quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
nonmonetary exchanges in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
sfas 
sfas requires that exchanges of productive assets for similar productive assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged except in those instances in which the exchanges of nonmonetary assets do not have commercial substance 
sfas is effective prospectively for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  adoption of sfas in the fourth quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
stock based payments include stock option grants and certain transactions under other company stock plans 
the company grants options to purchase common stock to some of its employees and directors under various plans at prices equal to the market value of the stock on the dates the options were granted 
in april  the securities and exchange commission amended the required adoption date of sfas r to be the first interim period of the first fiscal year beginning after june  the company intends to adopt this new standard during the first quarter of fiscal  as required  under the modified prospective method 
the effect of adoption of sfas r on outstanding share based awards is estimated to be million to million to per share after tax for fiscal however  the company s actual share based compensation expense in fiscal will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of awards granted and the fair value of those awards at the time of grant 
american jobs creation act of on october   the american jobs creation act of jobs act was signed into law by the president of the us this legislation resulted in sweeping revisions to the us internal revenue code and related regulations 
the jobs act repeals the foreign sales corporation fsc and extra territorial income eti regimes and replaces them with a domestic manufacturing deduction 
provides taxpayers with an opportunity to repatriate foreign source income into the us if such repatriated income is invested in the us under a properly approved domestic reinvestment plan 
changes certain provisions of the us internal revenue code related to foreign tax credit ftc calculations 
provides for penalties and increased disclosures related to transactions defined as reportable transactions 
provides for changes to executive compensation arrangements  including fundamental changes to non qualified deferred compensation plans  limits deductions for personal use of employer provided airplanes and provides for changes in withholding 
provides for changes affecting calculation and allocation of partnership income and ownership interests 
provides for substantial reforms for leasing transactions  including limitations on tax deductions allocable to property used by tax exempt entities 
codifies present law mobile machinery exemption for purposes of the retail excise tax on heavy vehicles  the heavy vehicle use tax and the tax on tires 
the company currently expects that the domestic manufacturing deduction benefit will exceed the current fsc eti benefit the company receives  resulting in potential increases in after tax earnings per share assuming dilution by an estimated beginning in fiscal and due to the phase in period of the domestic manufacturing deduction benefit 
further  certain aspects of the provisions for retail tax on heavy vehicles and on the tax on tires may result in increases in excise tax associated with certain of the company s products 
customers and backlog sales to the us government comprised approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales for this period 
a substantial majority of the company s net sales are derived from customer orders prior to commencing production 
the company s backlog at september  increased to  million compared to  million at september  fire and emergency segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  due to homeland security market development and improving domestic municipal markets 
the defense segment backlog increased to  million at september  compared to million at september   due to the us dod requirements associated with operation iraqi freedom 
commercial segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  unit backlog for refuse packers was up domestically and up in europe 
unit backlog for front discharge concrete mixers was down  while unit backlog for rear discharge concrete mixers increased 
the company may sell lower volumes of front and rear discharge mixers in fiscal as a result of its aggressive pricing strategy to offset higher steel and component costs 
approximately million of the overall increase in backlog related to con e co and london  which were acquired in fiscal approximately of the company s september  backlog is not expected to be filled in fiscal reported backlog excludes purchase options and announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed 
additionally  backlog excludes unfunded portions of the fhtv  mtvr and id iq contracts 
backlog information and comparisons thereof as of different dates may not be accurate indicators of future sales or the ratio of the company s future sales to the dod versus its sales to other customers 
financial market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the interest rates in the us and off shore markets 
in this regard  changes in us and off shore interest rates affect interest payable on the company s borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
the company has not historically utilized derivative securities to fix variable rate interest obligations or to make fixed rate interest obligations variable 
if short term interest rates averaged two percentage points higher in fiscal than in fiscal  then the company s interest expense would increase  and pre tax income would decrease by approximately million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost  but do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to mitigate the company s exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure other than as noted 
commodity risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  including steel  aluminum and composites 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  rubber and others which are integrated into the company s end products 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company generally obtains firm quotations from its suppliers for a significant portion of its orders under firm fixed price contracts in its defense segment 
in the company s fire and emergency and commercial segments  the company generally attempts to obtain firm pricing from most of its suppliers  consistent with backlog requirements and or forecasted annual sales 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 
foreign currency risk the company s operations consist of manufacturing in the us  canada  the netherlands  the united kingdom  italy and sweden and sales and limited truck body mounting activities throughout the us and in various european jurisdictions 
international sales were approximately of overall net sales in fiscal  including approximately of overall net sales in fiscal that involved export sales from the us the majority of export sales in fiscal were denominated in us dollars

should significant changes occur in the actual timing of forecasted british sterling receipts under the uk wheeled tanker contract  the underlying forward foreign exchange contracts which have been designated as a hedge of such forecasted receipts may become partially ineffective which could lead to unintended earnings volatility 
the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies primarily as a result of the effects of the translation of the geesink norba group  bai and london earnings from source currencies into us dollars and euro denominated purchases of tank bodies and tank pumping systems in the defense segment  and hedging customer orders denominated in currencies other than the us dollar

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the company s shareholders equity 
amounts invested in the company s non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year end
