item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our current facilities are adequate to fulfill our business commitments for the immediate foreseeable future 
item legal proceedings we are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings 
we are a party to routine claims and lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of such ordinary course proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe that the resolution of any future ordinary course matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders there were no matters submitted to a vote of our security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal part ii item market for common equity and related stockholders matters trading in our common shares has been conducted on the nasdaq smallcap market since may   under the symbol hdtv 
because we are traded on the smallcap market  our securities may be less liquid  receive less coverage by security analysts and news media and generate lower prices than might otherwise be obtained 
the following table sets forth  for the calendar quarters indicated  the range of high and low quotations for our common shares  as reported by commodity systems  inc hdtv common shares fiscal high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter the quotations listed above reflect inter dealer prices  without retail mark up  markdown or commission and may not represent actual transactions 
as of march   there were approximately holders of record of our common shares and the closing price per share was as reported on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the common shares represent the only class of securities outstanding as of the date of this filing 
to date  we have not paid a dividend on our common shares 
the payment of future dividends is subject to our earnings and financial position and such other factors  including contractual restrictions  as the board of directors may deem relevant 
under the terms of the financing completed on november  november financing  which is more fully described under item overview  we are prohibited from paying cash dividends while the senior secured convertible notes issued in the november financing remain outstanding 
it is therefore unlikely that dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future 
sales of unregistered securities on november   we issued senior secured convertible notes totaling  the notes are convertible into our common shares at the conversion price of per share 
interest payable under the notes at per year may be paid in our common shares  at our option if certain conditions are met  at a conversion price that will be calculated at the end of each quarterly interest period while the senior secured convertible notes are outstanding 
in october  we issued  common shares upon the exercise of a warrant 
the purchase price was per share and total cash received was none of the above securities transactions involved any underwriters 
all of the purchasers of our securities in the above described securities transactions were accredited investors within the meaning of rule under regulation d of the securities act of  as amended the act and  accordingly  all of these transactions were exempt from registration under the act by reason of section thereof 
we have used proceeds from the above described securities transactions to reduce our liabilities  for working capital purposes  to fund the construction and equipment for our new manufacturing facility in the republic of korea and for other general corporate purposes

this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions as indicated in the introductory paragraphs to item of this report 
the actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  customers reception of our products  intensity of competition  quality control during manufacturing and those set forth under risk factors 
overview we are in the business of manufacturing lcos sets that provide high resolution images suitable for applications  including high definition television  rear projection computer monitors and video projectors  and potential applications such as those used in wireless communication devices  portable games and digital assistants 
our lcos sets are designed for use in end products of oems  and therefore we work closely with customers and prospective customers to incorporate our microdisplays into their final products 
we are currently working with oems that manufacture high definition televisions 
status of business with lg electronics  inc in july  we entered into an agreement with lg electronics  providing for us to sell a specially tailored version of our t lcos sets to lg electronics see item  subsection technology and products under development for a description of our products 
under the agreement  lg electronics agreed to purchase from us a minimum of  lcos sets over an initial six month delivery period 
based upon progress to date  we currently anticipate that the initial six month delivery period for the lcos sets will begin in the second quarter of  subject to lg electronics completion of pre production requirements 
under the agreement  commencing in the first delivery month  lg electronics is required to provide us with rolling monthly firm purchase orders six months in advance of the scheduled delivery and rolling twelve month advance projections of its anticipated future orders 
although the agreement does not contain any minimum purchase requirements after the initial six month delivery period  it projects that lg electronics will commence larger mass production scale purchases of lcos sets from us in the seventh delivery month  which we currently expect to occur in the third quarter of the agreement is scheduled to have a two year delivery term with monthly deliveries of lcos sets 
all of the rights and obligations of the parties under the agreement are subject to a limited quantity of trial lcos sets  a majority of which have been delivered to lg electronics  meeting certain final technical specifications 
under the agreement  lg electronics and we have agreed to work together to the extent necessary to ensure that the trial lcos sets meet the final specifications 
since the signing of the agreement  we have been actively working together with lg electronics for integration of our lcos sets into lg electronics rear projection televisions 
the agreement provides that we will be the exclusive supplier of three chip lcos microdisplay products to lg electronics in and potentially in as well 
lg electronics will have the exclusive right in korea to purchase t microdisplay products from spatialight in and potentially in as well 
the agreement with lg electronics occurred as the result of lg electronics working with us pursuant to a joint development agreement entered into in may during the course of that work  we made specially tailored modifications to our new generation of t microdisplays for lg electronics development of a new line of state of the art high definition televisions 
in january  lg electronics announced in a joint press release with us that they are currently planning an initial rollout of inch and inch lcos televisions incorporating our lcos sets commencing in the second quarter of  subject to the completion of pre production requirements 
lg electronics also announced that its initial product rollout will be into the united states  korean and australian consumer markets  with future plans for expansion into other markets 
commencing in the second quarter of  we expect that a substantial percentage of our product deliveries will be made to lg electronics 
the loss of lg electronics as a customer or any delays in our delivery schedule to lg electronics  could harm our future sales or results of operations  and our substantial dependence on one customer is subject to risks set forth under the heading risk factors 
status of business in china to date  we have made deliveries of our microdisplay products to our chinese customers in limited quantities 
a substantial portion of such delivered products were in we have entered into business transactions with a significant number of customers and prospective customers in china 
current chinese customers are at different stages in the development and product introduction processes  and are progressing at a slower rate than we originally anticipated 
there were no shipments to our chinese customers in the fourth quarter of  but we expect that shipments will resume in the second quarter of we are maintaining our plans to ship our products to our chinese customers  although at a slower rate of shipment than originally expected 
while we have purchase orders in place with our chinese customers  such orders are for limited quantities of our products and they are cancelable at any time by such customers 
we therefore cannot provide assurances that we will sell significant quantities to our chinese customers in the future 
although our chinese customers progression from product prototyping to mass production has been far slower than we had anticipated  we remain positive about our business prospects in china and the potential for china to become a large market for us 
we currently believe that chinese television manufacturers tend to apply a market strategy of following the successful business models of global television manufacturing leaders  rather than acting as leaders themselves in terms of introducing new technologies to the marketplace 
we therefore believe that if the lcos technology gains greater acceptance in the high definition television marketplace  and if industry leaders  such as sony  jvc and lg electronics  present their lcos based televisions to the worldwide consumer markets in a prominent fashion  it will then be more likely that the chinese television manufacturers will follow these business models and ramp up their own lines of lcos high definition televisions 
we believe that our present course of continuing to transact business with major chinese television manufacturers is positioning us to be a leading lcos supplier in china in the future 
business development we are currently developing working relationships with prospective customers  located primarily in japan and other parts of the pacific rim region 
these prospective customers fall into two general categories television manufacturers and light engine suppliers 
we have provided samples of our lcos sets to certain of such prospective customers  but we do not have any formal agreements with such parties 
while we have made significant progress with respect to product integration and negotiating purchase orders with certain of these prospective customers  we cannot assure that we will receive any purchase orders binding on any of these companies for their purchase of our products in the near future 
even assuming that we receive purchase orders that are binding on the prospective customers  these orders and our sales to these customers and to our existing customers are subject to certain contingencies described under risks factors 
manufacturing capacity we have completed construction on our new manufacturing facility located in the republic of korea 
we have provided periodically updated photographs of the facility on our website  www 
spatialight 
com 
the korean facility will serve as our central commercial manufacturing base 
we expect that the facility will commence producing products for commercial sale in the second quarter of the facility is designed with the capacity  on full employment  to produce up to  lcos sets per month 
the facility has been specially designed for expansion to a capacity of  lcos sets per month in several expansion phases 
we believe that the facility can be expanded in an expedient manner in the event that such expansion becomes necessary based upon increased or perceived increased demand for our products from our customers 
we are actively hiring personnel for our korean manufacturing facility 
we are currently training our new operators and supervisors in key processes and equipment familiarization prior to beneficial occupancy of the new facility 
we believe that this will make our production transition more efficient and reduce the chances of our incurring unexpected delays in the transition process 
while we cannot provide any assurances against unexpected delays  we believe that our transition approach constitutes a proactive  measured and responsible plan to deal with facility completion risks and to prepare ourselves to manage our manufacturing facility in korea on a basis consistent with the anticipated demand for our products 
currently we manufacture our microdisplays in limited commercial quantities at our facility in california 
once the korean facility reaches full production mode  we intend to transition the california facility to research and development and special project operations 
we will not lay off any us employees as the result of opening the korean facility 
business strategy we currently offer two types of products to our customers and prospective customers lcos sets and display units 
see item  technology and development  for a more detailed description of our products 
since we commenced delivering our products to our customers in the third quarter of  there has been a significant shift in the type of product that we have delivered to our customers based upon their demand 
the shift in deliveries has been in the direction of more lcos sets and less display units 
we believe that this shift is significant because lcos sets are a higher margin product line and require less working capital than display units  although lcos sets yield less revenue than display units per unit sold 
it is our short term strategic objective to operate primarily as a seller of lcos sets and decrease our supply of display units to our customers 
it is our longer term strategic goal to exclusively sell lcos sets to our customers 
a number of our chinese customers currently purchase display units because they have not yet developed their own light engines 
we believe that the display unit  which is a turnkey product offering  has served as a short term solution and helped us to capture market share in china because many of our competitors did not possess a turnkey solution 
while we will continue to offer display units to those current customers who do not have their own light engine solution  we expect that new customer business in the future will exclusively be for lcos sets rather than display units 
our supply agreement with lg electronics is exclusively for lcos sets  as lg electronics has developed its own light engine designed to incorporate our lcos sets 
we expect that there will be a shift in products demanded by our chinese customers  over time  from display units to lcos sets 
these trends are consistent with our overall product strategy 
we currently manufacture two models of our lcos sets the t and the t models 
see item  technology and products under development  for a more detailed description of our lcos set models 
we believe that the t model will become the standard for the next generation of rear projection display devices and will provide the most cost effective  high resolution microdisplays in the industry and will position us to be a potential market leader 
we believe that the t s ability to deliver megapixel resolution in a high performance  reliable  and cost effective manner was a key factor in our obtaining the supply agreement with lg electronics 
the t model is the central component of our ongoing customer acquisition strategy described above 
liquidity and capital resources through december   we have sustained recurring net losses from operations and  at december   we had total equity of approximately  during  we experienced negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately  and a net loss of approximately  our operations were funded in by the proceeds derived from exercises of warrants and options of approximately  the sale of  of senior secured convertible securities and financing transactions raising an aggregate total of approximately  consummated in august and december as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of approximately  from the december  amount of  our net working capital at december   was approximately  compared to a net working capital of approximately  at december  in addition to the increase in cash of approximately  our current prepaids increased approximately  due to an increase in prepaid interest to a related party and prepaid financing costs related to the november financing 
this was offset by our accrued liabilities  which increased by approximately  due to liabilities associated with our manufacturing plant construction in korea 
net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately  and  in and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to increase in inventory and prepaid expenses  including certain financing costs incurred in the november financing 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  and  in and  respectively  resulting from the issuance of the senior secured convertible notes totaling  in and the aggregate net proceeds of  raised in three separate equity private placement transactions in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we have realized significant losses in the past and expect that these losses will continue until we start to receive significant revenues from the sale of our products 
we generated revenue of  during the ramp up in manufacturing and commercialization of our microdisplay products will require substantial expenditures during although we are expecting to generate revenues from the sale of our products in  we may continue to operate at a loss during there can be no assurance that our business will operate on a profitable basis thereafter 
we anticipate that our cash expenditures during will approximate  per month  or approximately million for the year  without regard to any revenue in we expect to meet our cash needs and fund our working capital requirements with our existing cash balances and from additional sources as follows the purchasers in the november financing have the option  which expires on august   to lend us an additional  on the same terms as the november financing 
robert a 
olins  our chief executive officer and a director of spatialight  and greenpark limited  an unaffiliated shareholder  jointly and severally committed to provide us with up to an additional  in financing  subject to certain reductions  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also expect to receive cash payments from our customers and from the exercises of options and warrants 
there can be no assurances that existing investors will exercise their warrants or that the purchasers in the november financing will exercise their right to make the additional lending investment 
we also filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec on january   for the sale of up to two million of our common shares  in one or more offerings 
as of the date hereof  such registration statement has not been declared effective by the sec  and we cannot offer any assurances as to when such registration statement may become effective 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with the financing commitment from robert a 
olins and greenpark limited will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for our operations for the remainder of off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we have long term contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to payment of debt and lease arrangements 
the following table aggregates our expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  payments due by period and contractual obligations beyond total employment agreements   long term convertible debt   senior secured convertible notes   interest on senior secured convertible notes     operating lease commitments       total contractual cash obligations       all interest underlying the notes  at the contractual rate of  has been prepaid through the issuance of common shares see note to consolidated financial statements

revenue in was related to initial shipments against purchase orders signed in no revenue was recognized in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue was   and  in  and  respectively 
cost of revenue consists primarily of product costs 
the high cost of revenue incurred in and is attributable to the low quantities of our products sold during these years 
as the volumes of our product deliveries increase in the future  we anticipate that our cost of revenue per product sold will decrease 
in addition  gross profits increased in and  respectively  as compared to the previous years  as the margins on lcos sets are greater than those on display units 
in  cost of revenue consisted of an inventory adjustment to lower of cost of market of  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately   and  in  and  respectively  and include professional services  salaries and related taxes and benefits  rent  depreciation  travel  insurance  and office expenses 
salaries and related taxes and benefits increased approximately  in over as a result of the reassignment of employees from research and development to general and administrative and an additional increase in the number of general and administrative and sales staff 
the amount of the salary and related costs increase was approximately  in addition  travel and entertainment increased by approximately  due to travel by our sales and marketing team as well as by management to generate new business 
in addition  in we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  to reserve a receivable from one of our chinese customers 
salaries and related taxes and benefits increased approximately  in over as a result of the reassignment of employees from research and development activities to general and administrative duties and an additional increase in the number of general and administrative staff  which was due to the transition toward commercial manufacturing of our microdisplay products 
an additional increase in is due to fees of  reimbursed to robert a 
olins  our chief executive officer and a director of spatialight  for fees he incurred in conjunction with the may private financing transaction see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report and an increase in rent expense of  stock based general and administrative expenses

for more information concerning the foregoing  see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
the amounts incurred in and relate primarily to stock and options granted to employees and directors  and warrants issued in exchange for services 
in addition  the amounts incurred in include a  reduction in a note receivable from one of our shareholders in exchange for a commitment to invest an additional  see note to consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to is due to the reclassification of existing employees to general and administrative duties  offset by an increase in consulting services related to our integrated circuit design 
the decrease from to is due to costs of approximately  expensed in related to test units and the purchase of prototype engines for testing purposes 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
these amounts are consistent with the balances in notes payable 
non cash interest expense 
non cash interest expense of approximately   and  in  and  respectively  relates to the valuation of the beneficial conversion feature of interest converted and convertible into equity on the notes payable to argyle capital management corporation  a company wholly owned by robert a 
olins  chief executive officer and a director of spatialight  based on the intrinsic value of the conversion feature 
the beneficial conversion interest represents the excess market value of the shares issued or issuable at current market prices over accrued interest payable 
in november  the notes were extended until december  in addition  amortization of the discount on the argyle notes is included in non cash interest expense 
also included in non cash interest expense is the amortization of note discounts related to the november financing 
the note discounts primarily resulted from the valuation of the additional investment rights or note purchase option  and beneficial conversion feature 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

income taxes 
income taxes consist primarily of minimum state tax requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
inflation 
our management currently believes that inflation has not had a material impact on continuing operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
revenue recognition we evaluate revenue recognition for these transactions using the following criteria collectively called the revenue recognition criteria o evidence of an arrangement before revenue is recognized  we must have evidence of an agreement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions to deliver our products 
o delivery for products  delivery is considered to occur when title and risk of loss have been transferred  which generally occurs upon shipment 
o fixed or determinable fee we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment 
if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize that amount as revenue when the amount becomes fixed or determinable 
we do not consider a fee to be fixed and determinable if any amount is due more than days from the delivery date 
payment terms of less than days are evaluated based upon the laws or trade practices of the country in which the arrangement is entered into to assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable 
o collection is deemed reasonably assured collection is deemed reasonably assured if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
we reduce product revenue for customer returns and sales allowances and record an allowance for doubtful accounts should collectibility become questionable 
if it is determined that an account is uncollectible  the account is written off against the allowance 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost based on the first in  first out method or market value 
we include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead in the cost of inventories 
in determining inventory market values  we give substantial consideration to the expected selling price of the product based on historical recovery rates 
if we assess the market value of our inventory to be less than costs we write it down to its replacement cost or its net realizable value 
our estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity and quality and mix of products in inventory  consumer and retailer preferences and economic conditions 
research and development our research and development costs  including costs of prototype lcos sets and display units  are charged to expense when incurred 
income tax assets and liabilities in establishing our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  we make judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to our operations 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluate the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks  final us and foreign tax settlements  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
due to our lack of profitable operating history  potential limitations on usage of operating losses and general uncertainty  we provided for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we are also subject to examination of our income tax returns for multiple years by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes to our income tax provision or the valuation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities may affect our annual effective income tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
the objective of eitf was to provide guidance for identifying impaired investments 
eitf also provided new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
the accounting provisions of eitf were effective for all reporting periods beginning after june   while the disclosure requirements were effective only for annual periods ending after june  in september  the fasb deferred the requirement to record impairment losses caused by the effect of increases in risk free interest rates and sector spreads on debt securities subject to paragraph of eitf and excludes minor impairments from the requirement until new guidance becomes effective 
we have evaluated the impact of the adoption of eitf and do not believe the impact is significant to the company s overall results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs fas  which requires certain inventory related costs to be expensed as incurred 
fas is effective january  the company has not assessed the effect of fas on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment to revise sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and supersede apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance 
it requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments at fair value 
sfas no 
r is to be applied in the third quarter of we have not yet evaluated the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our consolidated financial statements  however  the adoption could materially impact our results of operations 
risk factors we have a history of losses and may incur losses in the future and therefore cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability 
we have incurred losses to date and have experienced cash shortages 
in and  we incurred net losses of approximately  and  respectively 
in addition  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  as of december  we expect additional losses as we continue spending for production and other business activities as well as further research and development of our products 
as a result  we will need to generate substantial sales to support our costs of doing business before we can begin to recoup our operating losses and accumulated deficit and achieve profitability 
while we have obtained financing and financing commitments that we expect will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated financial needs through the second quarter of  if we are unable to obtain further financing in the future or generate required working capital for future capital needs  our ability to operate could suffer or cease 
our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash and will continue to require substantial amounts of capital in the future 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments essential to our ability to operate profitably  including further investments in research and development  equipment  facilities and production activities 
our financial condition and liquidity have been strongly assisted through private sales of our common shares  the million  less expenses  raised by us in the november financing  the  raised from the sale in december of one million of our common shares which were registered for sale by means of a shelf registration process  and  raised through exercises of stock options and warrants during the purchasers in the november financing also have the option  which expires on august   to lend an additional million on the same terms  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  robert a 
olins  chief executive officer and a director of spatialight and greenpark limited  jointly committed to provide us with up to million in future financing  subject to the conditions more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
despite these financing and commitments  we may still require additional financing to satisfy our increasing working capital requirements in the future 
reliance on private equity purchase agreements and public offerings and exercises of derivative securities to finance our future operations entails the additional risks of default by purchasers under such equity purchase agreements or our inability to sell publicly registered shares and an insufficient number of warrants being exercised owing to the prevailing market prices of our underlying common shares 
in the event that we require additional financing in the future and we are unable to obtain further financing on satisfactory terms  or we are unable to generate sales sufficient to offset our costs  or if our costs of development and operations are greater than we anticipate  we may be unable to increase the size of our business at the rate desired or may be required to delay  reduce  or cease certain of our operations  any of which could materially harm our business and financial results 
the obligations arising from the november financing restricts our future financing alternatives and may result in financial difficulties for us in the future 
the  senior secured convertible notes issued pursuant to the november financing bear a rate of interest and are not prepayable  in whole or in part  prior to their maturity on november  therefore  we do not have the ability to refinance the senior secured convertible notes with debt obligations bearing more favorable terms to us or out of the proceeds of an equity financing until their above noted maturity date 
however  after the first anniversary of the november financing s closing  we have the right to force conversion of the senior secured convertible notes into our common shares in the event that our common shares trade at or above of the conversion price of the senior secured convertible notes for twenty consecutive trading days 
furthermore  the senior secured convertible notes are secured by virtually all of the assets of our company  other than those located in korea  and it may therefore be difficult for us to obtain future debt financing  however  the terms of the november financing allow us to subordinate the security interests of the senior secured convertible notes to a security interest given to a bank or other institution arising from accounts receivable  contractual rights  inventory or similar financing 
if we default in meeting our obligations under the senior secured convertible notes  the indebtedness which they evidence will become immediately due and payable  and the holders of such senior secured convertible notes will be entitled to foreclose on our assets to the serious detriment of our future operations 
as noted elsewhere in this k  the senior secured convertible notes are convertible into our common shares and the issuance of such shares including any shares issued in payment of interest on such notes may have a dilutive effect on the value of our outstanding common shares 
we are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles  which may significantly harm our business 
our business model requires us to develop microdisplays that perform better than existing technologies  manufacture our spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays and or display units in bulk  and sell the resulting microdisplays and or display units to original equipment manufacturers that will then incorporate them into their products 
original equipment manufacturers make the determination during their product development programs whether or not to incorporate our spatialight imagengine tm microdisplays and or display units in their products 
this requires us to invest significant amounts of time and capital in designing our lcos sets and or display units before we can be assured that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment 
if we fail to recover our investment in the lcos sets and or display units  it could seriously harm our financial condition 
in addition  the time period that our products may be demanded by our customers could be limited by the acceptance of new technologies developed by our competitors 
we incur substantial operational and research and development costs in connection with products and technologies that may not be successful 
we currently have nine full time engineering and fourteen full time manufacturing personnel based in california working on microdisplays 
we are currently actively hiring personnel for our manufacturing facility located in the republic of korea 
we expect to hire approximately five engineers and forty five manufacturing personnel in korea by the end of the first quarter of and an additional five engineers and manufacturing personnel by the end of this staffing creates significant operational and research and development costs that may not be recouped 
even if our current lcos sets become accepted and or successful  we must continue to use  and may increase in number  our engineering and manufacturing personnel to develop future generations of our microdisplays because of the rapid technological changes in our industry 
as a result  we expect to continue incurring significant operational and research and development costs 
we are currently manufacturing and shipping our products in limited commercial quantities  but unanticipated difficulties in manufacturing our products in larger quantities may make it difficult to meet customer demands from time to time and our operating results could be significantly harmed by such difficulties 
problems in production of our lcos sets or display units or lower than expected manufacturing yields could significantly harm our business because we will have already incurred the costs for the materials used in the microdisplay manufacturing process 
these problems could cause delays that might lead our current and prospective customers to seek other sources 
we currently obtain silicon backplanes  a vital component in our microdisplays  from the far east 
some asian countries are subject to earthquakes  typhoons and political instability 
unless we obtain an alternative source  any disruption or termination of our silicon manufacturing source s operation in taiwan or air transportation with the far east could significantly harm our operations 
our lcos sets are assembled by combining the silicon backplanes with electronic components 
the design and manufacture of lcos sets and display units are highly complex processes that are sensitive to a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
we lease clean room space in california where we currently manufacture our lcos sets 
we believe that these current arrangements provide us with strong quality controls and effectively protect our proprietary technology in our products  but the risks discussed above associated with the highly complex processes of manufacturing these liquid crystal microdisplays remain applicable 
we continue to have working arrangements with the manufacturer of the light engines and lamps required in the assembly of our display units 
we have entered into an agreement for the supply of prisms and filters which are also required for the assembly of such units 
we do not have other such agreements which are binding upon the manufacturers of the other components and no such manufacturer is bound to furnish us with any specific quantities of their products at previously specified prices 
at this date  we are not aware that any of our component manufacturers has a known shortage of critical material 
because the manufacture of our lcos sets involves highly complex processes and technical problems may arise as we manufacture our liquid crystal microdisplays  we cannot assure the manufacturing yields of our products 
although we believe that we will be able to mass produce our lcos sets  other companies  including some with substantially greater resources than us  have found great difficulty or failed to do so 
current purchase orders and anticipated future purchase orders  which we cannot assure  will require us to produce greater quantities of our lcos sets than we have produced in the past 
problems in production  including problems associated with increasing our production output or lower than expected manufacturing yields could significantly harm our business and operating results 
in addition  the complexity of our manufacturing processes will increase as the sophistication of our lcos sets and display units increases  and such complexities may lend to similar difficulties that could harm our business and operating results 
while we intend  in the near future  to commence operations in our new manufacturing facility in the republic of korea  which will serve as our principal facility for manufacturing our microdisplay products  we may encounter difficulties in transitioning our manufacturing operations and difficulties in maintaining our quality controls over the manufacturing and production processes  any of which would be likely to cause significant harm to our business 
our decision to locate our principal manufacturing operations in the republic of korea may cause us to encounter one or more potential problems that could harm our business 
such potential problems could arise in connection with transitioning our manufacturing operations to the new facility in korea 
other problems may arise in the training of employees  which may occur as the result of cultural or language differences  which may create misunderstandings or cause inefficiencies in our operations 
the geographic separation between our corporate offices in the united states and our principal manufacturing operation in korea could result in managerial or supervisory problems  which could lead to decreased quality controls and a subsequent material harm to our business 
geopolitical conditions or potential military conflicts between allies the united states and the republic of korea and north korea may negatively impact our business 
we intend to operate our principal manufacturing operations in the republic of korea commencing in the second quarter of and our largest expected customer  lg electronics  resides in the republic of korea 
the republic of korea and north korea are technically at war with each other  despite the sanctioned existence of the demilitarized zone and the relative absence of physical conflict for several decades 
any escalation in the existing military conflict between these countries or any commencement  or perceived commencement of a military conflict between the united states and north korea  may limit our ability to effectively operate our manufacturing facility in the republic of korea and also may substantially limit our ability to sell products into the republic of korea because of the negative economic  physical or other destructive impact that such a conflict could have on our most important customer 
any such disruptions to our manufacturing operations and or ability to consummate sales to a substantial customer could adversely affect the development of our business and our financial condition 
if markets for our products do not continue to develop  our business will likely be significantly harmed 
various target markets for our products  including high definition televisions  projectors  monitors  and portable microdisplays  are uncertain and may be slow to develop 
in addition  companies in those markets could utilize competing technologies 
high definition television has only recently become available to consumers  and widespread market acceptance  although anticipated  is uncertain 
in addition  the commercial success of the portable microdisplay market is uncertain 
the acceptance of our lcos sets and or display units will be dependent upon the pricing  quality  reliability and useful life of these units compared to competing technologies  as to which there can be no assurance 
in order for us to succeed  not only must we offer end product manufacturers better and less expensive microdisplays than our competitors  but the manufacturers themselves must also develop commercially successful products using our products 
spatialight s marketing efforts are focused on developing strategic customer relationships with television oems  who are located principally in the pacific rim region 
our failure to sell our products to such manufacturers or the failure of the ultimate target markets to develop as we expect will negatively effect our anticipated growth 
if our products do not become widely accepted by our customers or the end users  our business could be significantly harmed 
our microdisplays may not be accepted by a widespread market 
even if we successfully obtain customer orders  our customers may determine not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons  including the following o superior technologies developed by our competitors  o price considerations  and o lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products 
we currently have purchase order agreements with a limited number of customers 
despite our reasonable efforts to retain these customers and obtain new customers  we may not be successful in either of these regards 
the loss of any one or more of these customers or a failure to obtain new customers could materially harm our business and financial condition 
we may become largely dependent on one customer for our future revenues  and failure to expand our customer base or receive additional orders from our existing customer base will make us vulnerable to substantial loss of potential revenues 
commencing in the second quarter of  it is likely that a substantial percentage of our anticipated revenues will be derived from lg electronics  based upon our agreement with lg electronics 
if we cannot diversify our customer base or derive increased revenues from our existing customer base through additional purchase orders and product deliveries  and therefore become primarily reliant on only one customer for a substantial percentage of our anticipated revenues  we will be vulnerable to a substantial decline in anticipated revenues if we lose lg electronics as a customer for any reason or if lg electronics were to otherwise reduce  delay or cancel its orders 
any such events could cause a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition and the value of our common shares could decline substantially 
our ability to retain and receive additional purchase orders from our current customers and to attract and receive purchase orders from prospective customers may depend upon the acceptance of lg electronics products in the consumer marketplace 
if lg electronics television products incorporating our lcos technology are not commercially successful  demand for our products from our current and prospective customers may not materialize  which could negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain additional purchase orders from our current or prospective customers  or  if we do  that such orders will generate significant revenues 
even though we have received purchase orders for our lcos sets and or display units from lg electronics and from several chinese oems and we may receive additional purchase orders from our prospective customers  we may have problems implementing volume production of such microdisplay products 
furthermore  sales to manufacturers in the electronics industry are subject to severe competitive pressures  rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
customers may  at any time  cancel purchase orders or commitments or reduce or delay orders  thereby increasing our inventory and overhead risks 
in addition  purchase orders received from our chinese customers are for limited quantities of our products 
therefore  despite the purchase orders received from current customers and other purchase orders that we may receive from prospective customers  we cannot assure you that these agreements will result in significant revenues to us 
if our customers products are not successful  our business would be materially harmed 
we do not currently sell any products to end users 
instead  we design and manufacture various product solutions that our customers ie  oems may incorporate into their products 
as a result  our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our customers products 
any significant absence of  or slowdown in the demand for our customers products would materially harm our business 
our dependence on the success of the products of our customers exposes us to a variety of risks  including our need to do the following o maintain customer satisfaction with our design and manufacturing services  o match our design and manufacturing capacity with customer demand and maintain satisfactory delivery schedules  o anticipate customer order patterns  changes in order mix  and the level and timing of orders that we can meet  and o adjust to the cyclical nature of the industries and markets we serve 
our failure to address these risks may cause us to lose sales or for sales to decline 
the electronics industry is highly competitive  which may result in lost sales or lower gross margins 
we serve highly competitive industries that are characterized by price erosion  rapid technological change and competition from major domestic and international companies 
this intense competition could result in downward pricing pressures  lower sales  reduced margins and lower market share 
some of our competitors have greater market recognition  larger customer bases  and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we possess 
as a result  they may be able to introduce new products and respond to customer requirements more quickly and effectively than we can 
our competitive position could suffer if one or more of our customers decide to design and manufacture their own microdisplay products  to contract with our competitors  or to use alternative technologies 
in addition  our customers typically develop a second source 
second source suppliers may win an increasing share of a program 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  both within and outside our control 
these factors include the following o our success in designing and manufacturing new display technologies  o our ability to address the needs of customers  o the quality  performance  reliability  features  ease of use  pricing  and diversity of our display products  o foreign currency fluctuations  which may cause a foreign competitor s products to be priced significantly lower than our displays  o the quality of our customer services  o the efficiency of our production sources  o the rate at which customers incorporate our displays into their own products  and o products or technologies introduced by our competitors 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the united states dollar and foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and profitability 
a portion of our costs is denominated in foreign currencies  including the korean won  the euro and the japanese yen 
as a result  changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currencies to the us dollar will affect our costs of good sold and operating margins  and could result in exchange losses 
we cannot fully predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our profitability 
from time to time  we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  although we have not engaged in any such hedging activities to date 
however  we cannot offer assurance that any hedging technique we may implement will be effective 
if it is not effective  we may experience reduced operating margins 
our business is significantly affected by conditions or events occurring in the electronics industry generally 
the electronics industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices  and production over capacity 
since the electronics industry is cyclical in nature  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations 
our results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
some of the factors that cause our operating results to fluctuate include the following o introductions of displays and market acceptance of new generations of displays  o timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders  o changes in our cost structure  o availability of labor and components  o pricing and availability of competitive products and services  o the timing of orders  o the volume of orders relative to the capacity we can contract to produce  o evolution in the life cycles of customers products  and o changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
the market price of our common shares is highly volatile 
the market price of our common shares has been highly volatile  reflecting among other things reported losses  receipts of additional financing and investors perceptions about our business prospects 
some research has shown that similar volatility in other companies correlates with class action securities lawsuits although to date we have not been a defendant in any such lawsuit 
the trading price of our common shares in the future could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  including the following o quarterly variations in our operating results  o actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new product developments by us or our competitors  o public announcements regarding our business developments  o changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  o sales of large numbers of our common shares by our shareholders  o general conditions in the electronics industry  and o worldwide economic and financial conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations and other factors may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
by further increasing the number of our common shares that may be sold into the market  any future offerings of our equity securities could cause the market price of our common shares to decrease significantly  even if our business operations are performing well 
the total number of common shares included in the form s registration statement that we filed with the sec on january  registration number  principally relating to the november financing represents approximately of the total number of our common shares that were issued and outstanding as of december  sales of these shares  as well as the  common shares included in the form s shelf registration statement filed by us with the sec on january   into the public market  or the perception that future sales of these common shares could occur  might adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares in the near future 
our common shares may not be liquid 
our common shares are currently traded on the nasdaq smallcap market 
our shareholders may find that it is more difficult to sell our common shares than shares that are listed on the nasdaq national market  american stock exchange or new york stock exchange 
the trading volume of our common shares has historically been adversely affected due to their limited marketability  but such volume has increased significantly in recent periods 
nevertheless  any substantial sales of our common shares may result in a material reduction in price  reflecting the volatility of the trading market for our common shares 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed 
our development and operations depend substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and qualified technical personnel 
our products require sophisticated production  research and development and technical support 
the competition for qualified management and technical personnel is intense 
the loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to add key personnel could have a material adverse affect on us  particularly since currently we do not have any insurance policies in place to cover that contingency 
our success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  marketing  manufacturing  financial and other key management personnel 
we face intense competition for the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products and technology 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain such personnel or not incur significant costs in order to do so 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property from use by third parties  our ability to compete in the industry will be harmed 
our future success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our registered intellectual property 
we believe that our success depends in part on protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements from our employees  consultants and advisors and other contractual provisions  to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult  however 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  we face the following risks o pending patent applications may not be issued  o patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  o unauthorized parties may obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  o others may independently develop similar technology or design around any patents issued to us  o breach of confidentiality agreements  o intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property  and o effective protection of intellectual property rights may be limited or unavailable in some foreign countries  such as china  in which we may operate 
specifically  although we consider the following unlikely because of the complex technological structure of our products  one or more of our current or prospective chinese  korean or taiwanese customers  or their respective employees or other persons including our competitors  that have or gain access to our products for testing purposes  may seek to misappropriate or improperly convert to their own use our intellectual property and a lack of adequate remedies and impartiality under the chinese  korean and other foreign legal systems may adversely impact our ability to protect our intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that we will have adequate remedies in the event any of the foregoing materializes 
failure to protect our intellectual property would limit our ability to produce and market our products in the future  which would materially adversely affect our revenues generated by the sale of such products 
in addition  third parties could assert that our products and technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
as a result  we may become subject to future patent infringement claims or litigation  the defense of which is costly  time consuming and diverts the attention of management and other personnel 
political  economic and regulatory risks associated with international operations may limit our ability to do business abroad 
a substantial number of our customers  manufacturers and suppliers are located outside of the united states  principally in the far east 
our international operations are subject to political and economic conditions abroad  and protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or foreign countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export or import compliance laws  or other trade policies  any of which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell displays in foreign markets and to purchase materials or equipment from foreign suppliers 
certain of our current purchase order agreements with customers are governed by foreign law and therefore  are subject to uncertainty with regard to their enforceability 
risks related to doing business in china may negatively affect our business 
our business is subject to significant political and economic uncertainties and may be adversely affected by political  economic and social developments in china 
over the past several years  the chinese government has pursued economic reform policies including the encouragement of private economic activity and greater economic decentralization 
the chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies or may significantly alter them to our detriment from time to time with little  if any  prior notice 
a lack of adequate remedies and impartiality under the chinese legal system may adversely impact our ability to do business in china and to enforce the agreements or purchase orders to which we are  or may become  a party 
at various times during recent years  the united states and china have had significant disagreements over political  economic and social issues 
controversies may arise in the future between these two countries 
any political or trade controversies between the united states and china  whether or not directly related to our business  could adversely affect our ability to do business in china 
we do not pay cash dividends 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common shares and do not anticipate that we will pay cash dividends in the near future 
furthermore  under the terms of the november financing  we are prohibited from paying cash dividends while the senior secured convertible notes issued in the november financing remain outstanding 
instead  we intend to apply any future earnings to the expansion and development of our business 
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
for example  the fasb has implemented changes to us gaap that require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants for all awards unvested at and granted after july  this regulation will negatively impact our earnings 
technology companies generally  and our company  specifically  rely on stock options as a major component of our employee compensation packages 
due to the new requirement to expense options  we are less likely to achieve profitability and we may consider decreasing or eliminating option grants 
decreasing or eliminating option grants may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we place all of our excess cash and cash equivalents in a checking account or money market account in the united states 
we do not expect any material losses from our placement of such cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is modest 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  a portion of our costs is denominated in foreign currencies  including the south korean won  the euro and the japanese yen 
as a result  changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currencies to the us dollar will affect our financial results  including costs of revenue and operating expenses  and could result in exchange losses or gains 
we cannot fully predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our profitability 
from time to time  we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  although we have not engaged in any such hedging activities to date
