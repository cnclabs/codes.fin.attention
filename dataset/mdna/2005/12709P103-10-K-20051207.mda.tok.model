the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements which are included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview cabot microelectronics corporation cabot microelectronics  the company  us  we  or our is the leading supplier of high performance polishing slurries used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit ic devices within the semiconductor industry  in a process called chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
cmp is a polishing process used by ic device manufacturers to planarize or flatten many of the multiple layers of material that are built upon silicon wafers in the production of advanced ics 
in this polishing process cmp slurries and pads are used to level  smooth and remove excess material from the surfaces of these layers  while leaving minimal residue or defects on the surface 
cmp slurries are liquid solutions generally composed of high purity deionized water  proprietary chemical additives and engineered abrasives that chemically and mechanically interact with the surface material of the ic device at an atomic level 
cmp pads are engineered polymeric materials designed to distribute and transport the slurry to the surface of the wafer and distribute it evenly across the wafer 
cmp enables ic device manufacturers to produce smaller  faster and more complex ic devices with fewer defects 
we believe cmp will become increasingly important in the future as manufacturers continue to shrink the size of these devices and to improve their performance 
we operate predominantly in one industry segment the development  manufacture and sale of cmp slurries 
our cmp products are used for a number of applications  such as polishing insulating dielectric layers  tungsten that is used to connect the multiple wiring layers of ic devices through these insulating layers  and copper wiring  including the associated barrier film 
we also develop  manufacture and sell cmp slurries for polishing certain components in hard disk drives  specifically rigid disk substrates and magnetic heads  and we believe we are one of the leading suppliers in this area 
further  we are developing and beginning to commercialize cmp polishing pads  which are used in conjunction with slurries in the cmp process 
we believe that demand for our products is primarily based on the number of wafers  or wafer starts  of advanced devices produced by semiconductor manufacturers 
revenue for fiscal was million  which was down from the million reported for fiscal following a period of strong semiconductor demand in the second half of fiscal  our revenue during the first three quarters of fiscal was adversely impacted in part by a subsequent downturn in the semiconductor industry  which we believe was partially driven by a reduction in wafer starts by some semiconductor manufacturers to reduce excess inventories of certain semiconductor devices 
in addition  our fiscal revenue was adversely affected by the remaining impact of one large customer transitioning to another supplier of cmp slurry for polishing copper interconnects at nanometer technology  as well as continued competition and pricing pressure resulting in selected price reductions 
however  revenue for our fourth quarter of fiscal increased by from the prior fiscal quarter  possibly signifying a semiconductor industry recovery 
while some industry experts appear to be cautiously optimistic about the near term outlook for the semiconductor industry  there are several factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our business  including the cyclical nature of  and continued uncertainty in  the semiconductor industry  short order to delivery time for our products and the associated lack of visibility to future customer orders  and the effect of competition 
for example  it is uncertain what impact higher energy costs may have on consumers disposable income  which may affect consumer demand for electronic devices and  in turn  demand for ic devices 

table of contents on a geographic basis  the asia pacific region continues to be the fastest growing region for ic manufacturing as well as for our business  and we expect this trend to continue in the future 
in furtherance of our strategic initiatives to advance our technology leadership and to get closer to our customers  we have opened our asia pacific technology center  located adjacent to our existing manufacturing facility in geino  japan  which includes a clean room and provides polishing  metrology and product development capability to support our customers in the region 
in addition  we are moving the portion of our business that serves the rigid disk market to singapore  since a number of important customers are located in southeast asia 
this will include establishing manufacturing operations  as well as relocating our commercial and technical teams 
additionally  we have announced plans to sell directly to our customers in taiwan  rather than through a distributor  which we believe will allow us to further strengthen our solid relationships with our customers there 
as part of the transition  we anticipate an adverse impact on our revenue for the second quarter of fiscal of approximately million as our distributor sells its remaining inventory of our products to our customers and we begin building inventory required to begin servicing these customers directly 
following this transition period  we believe our sales volumes will return to the prior level 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was  which represents a decrease from the reported for fiscal the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by selected price reductions  partially offset by higher yields in our manufacturing operations and a higher valued product mix 
we believe that through the execution of our operations excellence initiative  including the implementation of six sigma methods  we made notable productivity improvements in fiscal these improvements have allowed us to maintain gross margin as a percentage of revenue within a range of  plus or minus  in spite of increased competitive activity and pricing pressure  and we expect this to continue into fiscal we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r effective october using the modified prospective method  which we believe will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we will continue to use the black scholes model to approximate grant date fair value  and we expect to recognize approximately million of pre tax share based compensation expense for full fiscal  assuming we apply our historical approaches to paying long term incentives and determining fair value 
this expense will be recognized in our income statement either in cost of goods sold or in operating expenses  based upon the functional area in which the recipient of the share based compensation works 
we expect that the majority of our share based compensation expense will be recognized as general and administration expense 
other factors may also impact future share based compensation expense including the attribution of the awards to the service period  the vesting period of stock options  the timing and number of additional grants of stock option awards  fluctuations in and volatility of our stock price  expected term of the grants  expected risk free rate of interest and estimated forfeiture rates 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to bad debt expense  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  assets impairments  share based compensation  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts includes both a general reserve based on historical experience and an additional reserve for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial condition 
while historical experience may provide a reasonable estimate of uncollectible accounts  actual results may differ from what was recorded 
as of september  our allowance for doubtful accounts represented of gross accounts receivable 
if we had increased our estimate of bad debts by  to of gross accounts receivable  our general and administrative expense would have increased by million 
warranty reserve we maintain a warranty reserve that reflects management s best estimate of the cost to replace product that does not meet customers specifications and performance requirements  and costs related to such replacement 
the warranty reserve is based upon a historical product replacement rate applied against sales made in the current quarterly period  plus an additional amount related to any specific known conditions or circumstances 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
as of september  our warranty reserve represented of the current quarter revenue 
if we had increased our estimate of general warranty reserve by  to of the current quarter revenue  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or if inventory is deemed unmarketable 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon a historical percentage of actual inventory written off applied against inventory at the end of the period  plus an additional amount for known conditions and circumstances 
we exercise judgment in estimating the amount of inventory that is obsolete 
should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
also  the purchase cost of one of our key raw materials from one supplier may change significantly based upon the total quantity of in specification product that we purchase in a given fiscal year 
during interim periods we determine inventory valuation and the amount charged to cost of goods sold for this raw material from this supplier based on the expected average cost over the entire fiscal year using our current full year forecast of purchases of this raw material from this supplier 
impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in this grouping 
sfas requires that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the identified asset group is less than the carrying value of the asset group  then an impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset group from the reported value of the asset group 
determining future cash flows and estimating fair values requires significant judgments and is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generally over a long term period 

table of contents investment impairments in july we entered into a strategic alliance with  and purchased stock of  nanoproducts corporation  and we account for this investment using the equity method of accounting 
we evaluate the estimated fair value of our equity investment annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if an other than temporary impairment in the value of our investment has taken place 
no write down was recorded in fiscal stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  and no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we have elected to account for share based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
we disclose the summary of pro forma effects to reported net income as if we had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of share based compensation to employees of cabot microelectronics as prescribed by sfas in calculating such fair value  there are certain estimates that we use such as expected volatility  expected term and expected risk free rate of interest 
in december the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
under sfas r  the pro forma disclosure alternative permitted under sfas and sfas is no longer allowable 
we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that our future taxable income will be sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
commitments and contingencies we have entered into unconditional purchase obligations  which include noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we review our agreements and make an assessment of the likelihood of a shortfall in purchases and determine if it is necessary to record a liability 
in addition  we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business such as a legal proceeding or claim 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in december the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values  and the pro forma disclosure alternative permitted under sfas and sfas is no longer allowable under sfas r 
we will adopt sfas r effective october using the modified prospective method  and we believe the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we intend to continue to use the black scholes model to approximate grant date fair value  and we expect to recognize approximately million of pre tax share based compensation expense for full fiscal  assuming we apply our historical approaches to paying long term incentives and determining fair value 
other factors may also impact future share based compensation expense including the attribution of the awards to the service period  the vesting period of stock options  the timing and number of additional grants of stock option awards  fluctuations in and volatility of our stock price  expected term of the grants  expected risk free rate of interest and estimated forfeiture rates 

table of contents in may the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting changes and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle  unless it is impractical to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows will only be impacted by sfas if we implement a voluntary change in accounting principle or correct accounting errors in future periods 
in march the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin which is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fin requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas  as part of its short term international convergence project with the international accounting standards board iasb 
under sfas  nonmonetary exchanges are required to be accounted for at fair value  recognizing any gains or losses  if their fair value is determinable within reasonable limits and the transaction has commercial substance 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  which adopts wording from the iasb s ias  inventories  in an effort to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting 
the new standard indicates that abnormal freight  handling costs and wasted materials are required to be treated as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory costs 
additionally  the standard clarifies that fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of a production facility 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain line items included in our historical statements of income year ended september  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents year ended september  versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in  which represented a  or million  decrease from of this decrease  million was due to a decrease in sales volume and million was due to a decrease in weighted average selling price  primarily resulting from selected price reductions partially offset by a higher valued product mix 
revenue for fiscal would have been million lower had the average exchange rates for the japanese yen and euro during the period held constant with the prior year s average rates 
in august we announced plans to sell directly to our customers in taiwan  rather than through a distributor  in pursuit of our initiative to get closer to our customers 
as part of the transition  we anticipate an adverse impact on our revenue for the second quarter of fiscal of approximately million as our distributor sells its remaining inventory of our products to our customers and we begin building inventory required to begin servicing these customers directly 
following this transition period  we believe our sales volumes will return to the prior level and our revenue may increase slightly to the extent we are able to gain a portion of our distributor s margin 
our revenue in the first three quarters of fiscal was adversely affected in part by a semiconductor industry downturn  which we believe was partially driven by a reduction in wafer starts by some semiconductor manufacturers to reduce excess inventories of certain semiconductor devices 
while some industry experts appear to be cautiously optimistic about the near term outlook for the semiconductor industry  there are several factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our business  including the cyclical nature of  and the continued uncertainty in  the semiconductor industry  short order to delivery time for our products and the associated lack of visibility to future customer orders  and the effect of competition on pricing 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented a decrease of  or million  from of this decrease  million was due to lower sales volume and million was due to lower average costs per gallon  primarily due to improved manufacturing yields partially offset by higher fixed costs 
fumed metal oxides  such as fumed silica and fumed alumina  are significant raw materials that we use in many of our cmp slurries 
in an effort to mitigate our risk to rising raw material costs and to increase supply assurance and quality performance requirements  we have entered into multi year supply agreements with a number of suppliers 
we purchase fumed silica under a fumed silica supply agreement with cabot corporation  which provides for the cost of fumed silica to increase approximately over the initial six year term of the agreement  and in some circumstances is subject to certain inflation adjustments and shared cost savings adjustments resulting from our joint efforts 
this agreement runs through december  and will automatically renew unless either party gives certain notice of non renewal 
we purchase fumed alumina primarily under a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation that runs through december  and may be renewed at our option for another five year term 
the fumed alumina supply agreement provides that the price cabot corporation charges us for fumed alumina is based on all of its fixed and variable costs for producing the fumed alumina  its capital costs for an agreed upon capacity expansion  an agreed upon rate of return on investment and incentive payments if they produce above a threshold level of fumed alumina per year that meets our specifications 
our need for additional quantities or different kinds of key raw materials in the future has required  and will continue to require  that we enter into new supply arrangements with third parties 
future arrangements may result in costs which are different from those in the existing agreements 
in addition  rising energy costs may also impact the cost of raw materials  packaging and freight costs 
we also expect to continue to invest in our operations excellence initiative to improve product quality  reduce variability and improve product yields in our manufacturing process 

table of contents gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in as compared to in the percentage point decrease in gross profit margin resulted primarily from selected price reductions and lower utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the lower level of sales  partially offset by a higher valued product mix 
we continue to experience competition and pricing pressure  but expect to be able to continue to achieve productivity improvements in our manufacturing operations through ongoing execution of our operations excellence initiative 
therefore  we expect our gross profit as a percentage of revenue for fiscal to be in the range of  plus or minus 
research and development total research and development expenses were million in  which represented a decrease of or million  from the decrease is primarily related to million in lower expenses for clean room materials and laboratory supplies  million in lower technical service and analysis fees and million in lower facilities costs 
these decreases were partially offset by million in higher depreciation expense related to equipment purchased in for our cmp polishing and metrology clean room in aurora  illinois  and million in higher staffing costs 
our research and development efforts are focused on four main areas development and formulation of new and enhanced cmp slurry and pad products  research related to fundamental technology such as advanced chemistry and particle technology  process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products  and evaluation of new polishing applications outside of the semiconductor and data storage industries  such as our engineered surface finishes initiative 
we expect that the opening of our new asia pacific technology center will result in increased research and development expense in fiscal  which we intend to partially offset over time by decreased costs in our aurora facility as we transition certain research and development capabilities to asia 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase resulted primarily from higher staffing costs of million and higher facility costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreased consulting fees of million and lower product sample costs of million 
in furtherance of one of our key strategic initiatives of getting closer to our customers  we announced our decision to begin selling directly to customers in taiwan  effective april  rather than through a distributor 
therefore we expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase slightly in fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from the increase resulted primarily from million in higher staffing costs and million of increased professional fees primarily related to meeting the requirements of sarbanes oxley section amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million in and 
table of contents other income  net other income was million in  compared to million in the increase in other income is primarily due to million greater interest income from higher interest rates and our larger balance of cash and short term investments  as well as a million increase in foreign exchange gains 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to higher tax exempt interest income and the increased effect of extraterritorial income tax credits related to export sales from north america 
we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal to be approximately 
net income net income was million in  which represented a decrease of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 
year ended september  versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in  which represented a  or million  increase from of this increase  million was due to an increase in sales volume and million was due to an increase in weighted average selling price resulting from both a higher valued product mix and favorable foreign exchange rate changes  which more than offset selective price reductions that were granted to certain customers 
revenue for fiscal would have been million lower had the average exchange rates for the japanese yen and euro during the period held constant with the prior year s average rates 
also  in june  we began selling directly to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia rather than through a distributor 
during the transition to selling directly to customers  we experienced an adverse revenue impact of million during the third quarter of fiscal as we discontinued sales to our distributor while it drew down its inventory of our products 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from of this increase  million was due to higher sales volume 
an additional million was due to higher average costs per gallon resulting from increased fixed manufacturing costs  higher costs from lower yields in our manufacturing operations associated with meeting our customers more stringent product quality requirements  as well as transition costs associated with the termination of a polishing pad distribution agreement 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of million of expense incurred in fiscal related to a raw material supply agreement for a polishing pad technology that was previously under development but is no longer being pursued 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in as compared to in the decrease in gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from increased costs from lower yields in our manufacturing operations associated with meeting customer requirements for higher product quality 

table of contents research and development total research and development expenses were million in  which represented an increase of or million  from research and development expense increased primarily due to million in higher staffing costs  million in higher depreciation expense related to the purchase of equipment for our cmp polishing and metrology clean room in aurora  illinois  and million in higher technical service fees 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in laboratory supplies of million 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase resulted primarily from higher staffing costs of million  increased office expenses of million  higher travel costs of million  increased consulting fees of million and million in employee separation costs 
the higher selling and marketing expenses resulted from our increased customer support initiatives including our transition in june to selling direct to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia  rather than through a distributor 
increases in selling and marketing expenses also resulted from the transition to a global business team structure to provide a single point of accountability for each major product area 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from the increase resulted primarily from million in higher staffing costs  million of increased professional fees  million due to higher insurance premiums and million in employee separation costs 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million in and other income expense  net other income was million in  compared to being negligible in the increase in other income was primarily due to higher interest income and lower interest expense  offset by increased foreign exchange losses 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the decreased effect of tax credits from research and experimentation activities 
net income net income was million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 

table of contents inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our revenues and net income for the last three fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities of million in  million in and million in our cash provided by operating activities in originated from net income from operations of million and noncash items of million  which were partially offset by a net change in working capital of million 
in cash flows used in investing activities were million 
purchases of property  plant and equipment  primarily for the construction of our asia pacific technology center and manufacturing projects  were made with million in cash and million in accrued liabilities 
in addition  million was used for net purchases of short term auction rate securities and million was used for the final payment for our acquisition of a minority equity ownership interest in nanoproducts corporation 
in cash flows used in investing activities were million  of which million was used for net purchases of auction rate securities  which were previously presented as cash and cash equivalents see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  million was used for capital spending  including purchases of land in geino  japan  manufacturing equipment and research and development equipment 
finally  we invested million as partial payment for a minority equity ownership interest in nanoproducts corporation 
in cash flows used in investing activities were million  primarily due to million in purchases of manufacturing equipment  and a mm polishing tool and metrology tools to support increased polishing capacity in our clean room in aurora  illinois 
these capital expenditures were partially offset by million in cash received from the sale of assets  of which million related to the january sale of our distribution center and land in ansung  south korea 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million 
in cash flows used in financing activities were million  primarily as a result of million in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and million in principal payments under capital lease obligations 
these outflows were partially offset by the issuance of common stock of million from the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in cash flows used in financing activities of million were also largely a result of repurchases of million of common stock under our share repurchase program and million in principal payments under capital lease obligations 
these outflows were partially offset by the issuance of common stock of million from the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in cash flows from financing activities of million resulted from the issuance of common stock of million for the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
these cash inflows were partially offset by a million loan repayment  which is described below  and principal payments of million made under capital lease obligations 
in july we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock and we completed the program during the fourth quarter of fiscal shares were repurchased from time to time  depending on market conditions  in open market transactions  at management s discretion 
we funded share repurchases from our existing cash balance 
the plan was primarily intended to diminish earnings dilution from the issuance of stock from the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in october we announced that our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock  under terms and conditions similar to those of the july share repurchase program 
the program may be suspended or terminated at any time  at the company s discretion 
we view the program as an effective means by which to return cash to shareholders 
in february  we prepaid the entire million unsecured term loan that had been funded on the basis of the illinois state treasurer s economic program 
the loan had been due in april and had incurred interest at an annual rate of 
no gain or loss was recognized with respect to the prepayment 
as a result of this prepayment  we have no outstanding long term debt 

table of contents on november   we terminated and replaced our existing unsecured revolving credit and term loan with an amended and restated unsecured revolving credit facility of million with an option to increase the facility by up to million 
under this agreement  which terminates in november but can be renewed for two one year terms  interest accrues on any outstanding balance at either the institution s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin 
a non use fee also accrues 
loans under this facility are anticipated to be used primarily for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants 
no amounts are currently outstanding under this credit facility and we believe we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
we have exercised the first renewal option to extend the currently scheduled termination date by one year to november  we believe that cash generated by our operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  expected capital expenditures  including merger and acquisition activities  and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
however  we plan to expand our business and continue to improve our technology and  to do so  we may be required to raise additional funds in the future through public or private equity or debt financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements at september  and  we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations less than after in millions total year years years years capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations capital lease obligations in december we entered into a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation under which we agreed to pay cabot corporation for the expansion of a fumed alumina manufacturing facility in tuscola  illinois 
the payments for the facility have been treated as a capital lease for accounting purposes and the present value of the minimum quarterly payments resulted in an initial million lease obligation and related leased asset 
the agreement has an initial five year term  which expires in  but we can choose to renew the agreement for another five year term  which expires in we also can choose not to renew the agreement subject to certain terms and conditions and the payment of certain costs  after the initial five year term 

table of contents operating leases we lease certain vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  machinery and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable operating leases  most of which expire within ten years and may be renewed by us 
purchase obligations we operate under a fumed silica supply agreement with cabot corporation under which we are obligated to purchase at least of our six month volume forecast and to pay for the shortfall if we purchase less than that amount 
this agreement has an initial six year term  which expires in december and will automatically renew unless either party gives certain notice of non renewal 
we currently anticipate meeting minimum forecasted purchase volume requirements 
we also operate under the fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation  described above in capital lease obligations  under which we are obligated to pay certain fixed  capital and variable costs 
purchase obligations include million of contractual commitments for fumed silica and fumed alumina under these contracts calculated based on the fumed alumina agreement running through december we have an agreement with a toll manufacturer pursuant to which the manufacturer performs certain agreed upon dispersion services 
we have agreed to purchase minimum annual services and to invest approximately million per year in capital improvements or other expenditures to maintain capacity at the manufacturer s dispersion facility 
the initial term of the agreement expired in october  and in november was renewed for another year under similar terms and conditions 
the contract continues to have automatic one year renewals  and contains a day cancellation clause executable by either party 
purchase obligations related to this agreement are million  which includes a termination payment if the agreement is not renewed 
in october  we opened our new asia pacific technology center located adjacent to our existing manufacturing facility in geino  japan 
the new  square foot facility includes a clean room and provides polishing  metrology and product development capabilities 
purchase obligations related to this capital expansion are million  which include remaining construction payments and equipment purchases 
other long term liabilities other long term liabilities include million for pension liabilities and million for deferred compensation obligations 
factors affecting future operating results risks relating to our business we have a narrow product range and our products may become obsolete  or technological changes may reduce or limit increases in cmp consumption our business is substantially dependent on a single class of products  cmp slurries  which historically has accounted for almost all of our revenue 
our business would suffer if these products became obsolete or if consumption of these products decreased 
our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the semiconductor industry and to adapt  improve and customize our products for advanced ic applications in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends 
since its inception  the semiconductor industry has experienced rapid technological changes and advances in the design  manufacture  performance and application of ic devices  and our customers continually pursue lower cost of ownership of materials consumed in their manufacturing processes  including cmp slurries 
we expect these technological changes and advances  and this drive toward lower costs  to continue in the future 
emerging technologies in the semiconductor industry  such as electrochemical mechanical planarization ecmp  as well as our customers efforts to reduce consumption of cmp slurries  could render our products less important to the ic device manufacturing process 

table of contents a significant amount of our business comes from a limited number of large customers and our revenue and profits could decrease significantly if we lost one or more of them as customers our customer base is concentrated among a limited number of large customers 
one or more of these principal customers may stop buying cmp slurries from us or may substantially reduce the quantity of cmp slurries they purchase from us 
our principal customers also hold considerable purchasing power  which can impact the pricing and terms of sale of our products 
any deferral or significant reduction in cmp slurries sold to these principal customers  or a significant number of smaller customers  could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in fiscal  our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  with marketech  our largest customer and also our distributor in taiwan and china  accounting for approximately of our revenue 
in fiscal  our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  with marketech  our largest customer  accounting for approximately of our revenue 
in august we announced the modification of our distribution agreement with marketech  such that we will sell our products directly to customers in taiwan beginning april marketech will continue to distribute our products in china 
our business could be seriously harmed if our existing or future competitors develop superior slurry products  offer better pricing terms or service  or obtain certain intellectual property rights competition from current cmp slurry manufacturers or new entrants to the cmp slurry market could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
competition has increased from other existing providers of cmp slurries and opportunities exist for other companies with sufficient financial or technological resources to emerge as potential competitors by developing their own cmp slurry products 
increased competition has and may continue to impact the prices we are able to charge for our slurry products as well as our overall business 
in addition  our competitors could have or obtain intellectual property rights which could restrict our ability to market our existing products and or to innovate and develop new products 
because we have limited experience in business areas outside of cmp slurries  expansion of our business into new products and applications may not be successful an element of our strategy has been to leverage our current customer relationships and technological expertise to expand our cmp business from slurries into polishing pads 
additionally  under our engineered surface finishes initiative we are translating our core technical expertise in cmp technology for the semiconductor industry  with which we modify surfaces at an atomic level  into a range of demanding surface modifications and polishing applications in other industries where shaping  enabling and enhancing the performance of surfaces is as critical to success as it is in the semiconductor industry 
expanding our business into new product areas involves technologies and production processes in which we have limited experience  and we may not be able to develop and produce products that satisfy our customers needs or we may be unable to keep pace with technological or other developments 
also  our competitors may have or obtain intellectual property rights which could restrict our ability to market our existing products and or to innovate and develop new products 
any problem or interruption in supply of our most important raw materials  including fumed metal oxides  could delay our slurry production and adversely affect our sales our business would suffer from any problem or interruption in our supply of the key raw materials we use in our cmp slurries  including fumed alumina and fumed silica 
for example  we operate under a fumed silica supply agreement and fumed alumina supply agreements with cabot corporation 
under these agreements  cabot corporation continues to be our primary supplier of particular amounts and types of fumed alumina and fumed silica 
we believe it would be difficult to promptly secure alternative sources of key raw materials  including fumed metal oxides  in the event one of our suppliers becomes unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials that meet the quality and technical specifications required by our customers 
in addition  contractual amendments to the existing agreements with  or non performance by our suppliers could adversely affect us as well 

table of contents also  if we change the supplier or type of key raw materials  such as fumed metal oxides we use to make our existing cmp slurries or are required to purchase them from a different manufacturer or manufacturing facility or otherwise modify our products  in certain circumstances our customers might have to requalify our cmp slurries for their manufacturing processes and products 
the requalification process could take a significant amount of time to complete and could motivate our customers to consider purchasing products from our competitors  possibly interrupting or reducing our sales of cmp slurries to these customers 
we are subject to some risks associated with our foreign operations we currently have operations and a large customer base outside of the united states 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated by sales to customers outside of the united states 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated by sales to customers outside of the united states 
we encounter risks in doing business in certain foreign countries  including but not limited to  adverse changes in economic and political conditions  as well as difficulty in enforcing business and customer contracts and agreements  including protection of intellectual property rights 
because we rely heavily on our intellectual property  our failure to adequately obtain or protect it could seriously harm our business protection of intellectual property is particularly important in our industry because cmp slurry and pad manufacturers develop complex technical formulas for cmp products which are proprietary in nature and differentiate their products from those of competitors 
our intellectual property is important to our success and ability to compete 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as employee and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could seriously harm our business 
we may pursue acquisitions and strategic alliances which could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results if they are unsuccessful we expect to continue to make investments in companies  either through acquisitions  investments or alliances  in order to supplement our internal development efforts 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in entering markets in which we have limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies  or inability to effectively cooperate and collaborate with our alliance partners 
further  we may never realize the perceived or anticipated benefits of a business combination 
future acquisitions by us could have negative effects on our results of operations  such as contingent liabilities and amortization charges related to intangible assets 
investments and acquisitions of high technology and development stage companies are inherently risky because these businesses may never develop  and we may incur losses related to these investments 
in addition  we may be required to write down the carrying value of these investments to reflect other than temporary declines in their value  which could harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents demand for our products and our business may be adversely affected by worldwide economic and industry conditions our business is affected by current economic and industry conditions and it is extremely difficult to predict sales of our products given uncertainties in these factors 
for example  our revenue in the first three quarters of fiscal was adversely affected in part by a semiconductor industry downturn  which we believe was partially driven by a reduction in wafer starts by some semiconductor manufacturers to reduce excess inventories of certain semiconductor devices 
as we enter into fiscal we are cautiously encouraged by what we believe are indicators of improving business trends  however there are several factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our business  including the cyclical nature of  and the continued uncertainty in  the semiconductor industry  short order to delivery time for our products and the associated lack of visibility to future customer orders  and the effect of competition on pricing 
our inability to attract and retain key personnel could cause our business to suffer if we fail to attract and retain the necessary managerial  technical and customer support personnel  our business and our ability to maintain existing and obtain new customers  develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly those with significant experience in the cmp and ic device industries  is intense 
the loss of services of key employees could harm our business and results of operations 
risks relating to the market for our common stock the market price may fluctuate significantly and rapidly the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and could continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of factors such as economic and stock market conditions generally and specifically as they may impact participants in the semiconductor industries  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts who follow our stock  earnings and other announcements by  and changes in market evaluations of  us or participants in the semiconductor and related industries  changes in business or regulatory conditions affecting us or participants in the semiconductor and related industries  announcements or implementation by us  our competitors  or our customers of technological innovations  new products or different business strategies  and trading volume of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions under our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our rights plan may discourage third parties from making an unsolicited bid for our company our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  our rights plan and various provisions of the delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company 
for example  our amended certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to million shares of blank check preferred stock and to attach special rights and preferences to this preferred stock 
also our amended certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our board of directors into three classes as nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three year terms 
in addition  the rights issued to our stockholders under our rights plan may make it more difficult or expensive for another person or entity to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct business operations outside of the united states through our foreign operations 
our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  the british pound and the euro 
from time to time we enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure 
however  we may be unable to hedge these exposures completely 
approximately of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
market risk and sensitivity analysis foreign exchange rate risk we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates 
as of september   the analysis demonstrated that such market movements would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows over a one year period 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency rate movements and our actual exposures
