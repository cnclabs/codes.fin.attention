item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations approximately of power s operating revenues represented tolling revenues of the michigan facility  was derived from the colorado facility operated as an independent power producer under a long term contract with xcel energy s public service company of colorado unit  and the remaining primarily resulted from fees for operating the other colorado facility 
in recent periods  we have recorded impairment charges associated with our power business activities  see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
kinder morgan power previously designed  developed and constructed power projects 
in  following an assessment of the electric industry s business environment and noting a marked deterioration in the financial condition of certain power generating and marketing participants  we decided to discontinue our power development activities 
in february  kinder morgan power announced an agreement under which williams energy marketing and trading agreed to supply natural gas to and market capacity for years for a megawatt natural gas fired orion technology electric power plant in jackson  michigan 
effective july   construction of this facility was completed and commercial operations commenced 
concurrently with commencement of commercial operations  i kinder morgan power made a preferred investment in triton power company llc now valued at approximately million  and  ii triton power company llc  through its wholly owned subsidiary  triton power michigan llc  entered into a year lease of the jackson power facility from the plant owner  alphagen power  llc 
williams energy marketing and trading supplies all natural gas to and purchases all power from the power plant under a year tolling agreement with triton power michigan llc 
in may  kinder morgan power and mirant corporation formerly southern energy inc announced plans to build a megawatt natural gas fired electric power plant in wrightsville  arkansas  utilizing kinder morgan power s orion technology 
construction of this facility was completed on july  and commercial operations commenced 
mirant corporation operates and maintains the wrightsville facility and manages the natural gas supply and electricity sales for the project company that owns the power plant 
kinder morgan power made an investment in the project company  comprised primarily of preferred stock 
this facility has not been dispatched significantly since july  in october  the project company was included in mirant corporation s bankruptcy filing 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote off our remaining investment in the wrightsville power facility  as further discussed in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  kinder morgan power acquired interests in the thermo companies  which provided us with our first electric generation assets as well as knowledge and expertise with general electric company jet engines lms configured in a combined cycle mode 
through the thermo companies  kinder morgan power acquired the interests in three colorado natural gas fired electric generating facilities discussed above  which have a combined megawatts of electric generation capacity 
kinder morgan power used the lm knowledge to develop its proprietary orion technology 
pursuant to a right we obtained in conjunction with the acquisition of the thermo companies  in december  we made an additional investment in the thermo companies in the form of approximately million kinder morgan management shares that we owned 
we delivered these shares to an entity controlled by the former thermo owners 
for further information regarding this incremental investment  see power within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition with respect to the electric generating facilities acquired from the thermo entities  kinder morgan power does not directly face competition with respect to the sale of the power generated  as it is sold to or generated for the local electric utility under long term contracts 
with respect to power s investment in the jackson  michigan facility  the principal impact of competition is the level of dispatch of the plant and the related but minor effect on profitability 
regulation interstate transportation and storage services under the natural gas act and  to a lesser extent  the natural gas policy act of  the federal energy regulatory commission regulates both the performance of interstate transportation and storage services by interstate natural gas pipeline companies  and the rates charged for such services 
terms and conditions of such services are subject to tariffs approved by the ferc 
as used in this report  ferc refers to the federal energy regulatory commission 
with the adoption of ferc order no 
 the ferc required interstate natural gas pipelines that perform open access transportation under blanket certificates to unbundle or separate their traditional merchant sales services from their transportation and storage services and to provide comparable transportation and storage services with respect to all natural gas supplies  whether such natural gas is purchased from the pipeline or from other merchants such as marketers or producers 
each interstate natural gas pipeline must now separately state the applicable rates for each unbundled service 
in order nos 
and a  the ferc directed all interstate pipelines to make tariff changes as necessary to comply with new regulatory requirements regarding scheduling procedures  capacity segmentation  imbalance management services and penalty credits 
the order tariff provisions for ngpl became effective on december  no issues remain outstanding as to ngpl s order compliance program 
we are also subject to the requirements of ferc order no 
 et seq  which set out revised standards of conduct that apply uniformly to interstate gas transmission pipelines and public utilities  governing their relationships with energy affiliates 
these new standards of conduct were designed to be more restrictive than the previous regulations that did not cover an interstate natural gas pipeline s relationship with energy affiliates that are not marketers 
in addition  unlike the prior regulations  these requirements apply even if the energy affiliate is not a customer of its affiliated interstate pipeline 
the rule is designed to prevent interstate natural gas pipelines from giving undue preference  including preference in the access to information  to any of their energy affiliates and to ensure that natural gas transportation is provided on a nondiscriminatory basis 
the kinder morgan interstate pipelines have implemented compliance with the standards of conduct as of september  the pipeline safety improvement act of was signed into law on december   providing guidelines in the areas of testing  education  training and communication 
the act requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as high consequence areas 
pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests within ten years of the date of enactment and must perform subsequent integrity tests on a seven year cycle 
at least of the highest risk segments must be tested within five years of the enactment date 
the risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
testing consists of hydrostatic testing  internal electronic testing  or direct assessment of the piping 
in addition to the pipeline integrity tests  pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained  and the united states department of transportation has approved our qualification program 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with this law s requirements and have integrated appropriate aspects of this pipeline safety law into our operator qualification program  which is already in place and functioning 
ngpl estimates that the average annual incremental expenditure associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of is approximately million to million 
intrastate transportation and sales we operate an intrastate pipeline in colorado  rocky mountain natural gas company  which is regulated by the public utilities commission for the state of colorado as a public utility with respect to its natural gas transportation and sales services within the state 
rocky mountain natural gas company also performs certain natural gas transportation services in interstate commerce pursuant to ferc authorization 
the public utilities commission for the state of colorado regulates the rates  terms  and conditions of natural gas sales and transportation services performed by public utilities in the state of colorado 
during  our intrastate pipeline in wyoming  northern gas company  was merged into kinder morgan  inc and is now operated as part of our retail distribution business in wyoming pursuant to approvals received from the wyoming public service commission 
the operations of our intrastate pipeline business are also affected by ferc rules and regulations issued pursuant to the natural gas act and the natural gas policy act 
of particular importance are regulations that result in an increased ability to provide interstate transportation services without the necessity of obtaining prior ferc authorization for each transaction 
a key element of the program is nondiscriminatory access  under which a regulated pipeline must agree  under certain conditions  to transport natural gas for any party requesting such service 
retail natural gas distribution services our intrastate pipelines and local natural gas distribution businesses in colorado  nebraska and wyoming are under the regulatory authority of each respective state s utility commission 
in certain of the incorporated communities in which we provide retail natural gas services  we operate under franchises granted by the applicable municipal authorities 
these franchises vary in duration 
in unincorporated areas  our natural gas utility services are not subject to municipal franchise 
we have been issued various certificates of public convenience and necessity by the regulatory commissions in colorado  nebraska and wyoming authorizing us to provide natural gas utility services within certain incorporated and unincorporated areas of those states 
we are a leader in providing for customer choice in purchasing gas supply directly from suppliers under our choice gas programs in wyoming and nebraska 
we introduced the choice gas program in  under an order issued by the wyoming public service commission 
the program is available to all  end use customers we serve in the state 
in  we announced a similar plan to give residential and small commercial customers in nebraska a choice of natural gas suppliers 
this program  the nebraska choice gas program  became effective june  and is now available to all  customers we serve in nebraska 
the programs have succeeded in providing a choice of suppliers  competitive prices  and new products  services and pricing options to our customers  while maintaining reliability and security of supply 
kinder morgan retail continues to provide all services other than the natural gas commodity in these programs  and competes with other suppliers in offering natural gas supplies to retail customers 
environmental regulation our operations and properties are subject to extensive and evolving federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the release or discharge of regulated materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health and safety 
we have an environmental compliance program  and we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
this program focuses on compliance with state and federal laws and regulations relating to the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act and solid waste issues and other related and applicable environmental laws and regulations 
numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws  for which compliance is often costly and onerous 
failure to comply with applicable environmental laws may result in substantial administrative  civil  and criminal penalties or injunctions that would restrict operations or require future compliance  damage awards against us  or other mandatory or consensual measures or liabilities 
these laws and regulations can also impose liability for remedial costs on the owner or operator of properties or the generators of materials  regardless of fault 
moreover  a trend in environmental law is toward stricter standards  stricter enforcement  and more restrictions on operations 
this trend and other developments in environmental law may result in significant cost and liabilities for us 
we had an environmental reserve of approximately million at december   to address remediation issues associated with approximately projects 
these projects include several ground water and soil hydrocarbon remediation efforts under the jurisdiction and direction of various state agencies 
many of these remediation efforts are the result of historical releases from currently non operating sites 
additionally  we are addressing impacts at several locations from the historical use of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls 
we believe that costs for environmental remediation and separately ongoing compliance with applicable environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial position or results of operations  or materially diminish our ability to operate our businesses 
however  there can be no assurances that future events  such as changes in existing laws  the promulgation of new laws  the discovery of circumstances or conditions currently unforeseen by us  or that the development of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant unanticipated costs and liabilities 
risk factors like all businesses  we face various obstacles  including rising legal fees  environmental issues and escalating employee health and benefit costs 
regulatory challenges to our regulated service rates and possible policy changes made by governmental regulatory entities could negatively affect our future financial performance 
further  we are well aware of the general uncertainty associated with the current world economic and political environments in which we exist and we recognize that we are not immune to the fact that our financial performance is impacted by overall marketplace spending and demand 
we are continuing to assess the effect that terrorism would have on our businesses and in response  we have increased security at certain of our assets 
recent federal legislation provides an insurance framework that should cause current insurers to continue to provide sabotage and terrorism coverage under standard property insurance policies 
nonetheless  there is no assurance that adequate sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at reasonable rates throughout currently  we do not believe that the increased cost associated with these measures will have a material effect on our operating results 
some of our specifically identified risk factors include the following we are highly dependent upon the earnings and distributions of kinder morgan energy partners 
for  approximately of our total segment earnings plus earnings attributable to our investment in kinder morgan energy partners was attributable to our general and limited partner interests in kinder morgan energy partners 
a significant decline in kinder morgan energy partners earnings and or cash distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us 
for more information on these earnings and cash distributions  please see kinder morgan energy partners annual report on form k 
competition could ultimately lead to lower levels of profits and adversely impact our ability to recontract for expiring transportation capacity at favorable rates 
for  ngpl s segment earnings of million represented approximately of total segment earnings plus earnings attributable to our investment in kinder morgan energy partners  and approximately of our income from continuing operations before interest and income taxes 
ngpl is an interstate natural gas pipeline that is a major supplier to the chicago  illinois area 
in recent periods  interstate pipeline competitors of ngpl have constructed or expanded pipeline capacity into the chicago area  although additional take away capacity has also been constructed 
to the extent that an excess of supply into this market area is created and persists  ngpl s ability to recontract for expiring transportation capacity at favorable rates could be impaired 
contracts representing approximately of ngpl s total long haul  contracted firm transport capacity as of january  are scheduled to expire during our large amount of floating rate debt makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
at december   we had billion of debt subject to floating interest rates  all of which was long term fixed rate debt converted to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps 
should interest rates increase significantly  our earnings would be adversely affected 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the rates which include reservation  commodity  surcharges  fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for we charge shippers on our pipeline systems are subject to regulatory approval and oversight 
while there are currently no material proceedings challenging the rates on any of our natural gas pipeline systems  regulators and shippers on these pipelines do have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations 
we can provide no assurance that we will not face challenges to the rates we receive on our pipeline systems in the future 
sustained periods of weather inconsistent with normal in areas served by our natural gas transportation and distribution operations can create volatility in our earnings 
weather related factors such as temperature and rainfall at certain times of the year affect our earnings in our natural gas transportation and retail natural gas distribution businesses 
sustained periods of temperatures and rainfall that differ from normal can create volatility in our earnings 
proposed rulemaking by the ferc or other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction could adversely impact our income and operations 
generally speaking  new laws or regulations or different interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our assets could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental regulation and liabilities could result in increased operating and capital costs 
our business operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  pollution and human health and safety 
for example  if an accidental leak or spill occurs at or from our pipelines  or at or from our storage or other facilities  we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak or spill  pay for government penalties  address natural resource damages  compensate for human exposure  install costly pollution control equipment  or a combination of these and other measures 
the resulting costs and liabilities could negatively affect our level of earnings and cash flow 
in addition  emission controls required under federal and state environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities 
the impact of environmental standards or future environmental measures could increase our costs significantly 
since the costs of environmental regulation are already significant  additional or stricter regulation or enforcement could negatively affect our business 
we own or operate numerous properties that have been used for many years in connection with pipeline activities 
while we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at or from our properties or at or from other properties where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose management and disposal of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to laws such as the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  also known as cercla or the superfund law  which impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
under such laws and implementing regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination  including groundwater contamination caused by prior owners or operators 
imposition of such liability schemes could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial position 
the distressed financial condition of some of our customers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these customers are unable to pay us for the services we provide 
some of our customers are experiencing severe financial problems  and other customers may experience severe financial problems in the future 
the bankruptcy of one or more of them  or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities 
in addition  such events might force such customers to reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
increased regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of our pipelines will require us to spend additional money to comply with these requirements 
through our regulated pipeline subsidiaries  we are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity 
for example  recent federal legislation signed into law in december includes new guidelines for the us department of transportation and pipeline companies in the areas of testing  education  training and communication 
compliance with existing and recently executed regulations requires significant expenditures 
additional laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future could significantly increase the amount of these expenditures 
other amounts we spent during   and on research and development activities were not material 
we employed  people at december   including employees of our indirect subsidiary kmgp services company  inc  who are dedicated to the operations of kinder morgan energy partners 
kmgp services company  inc  a subsidiary of kinder morgan gp  inc  provides employees and kinder morgan services llc  a subsidiary of kinder morgan management  provides centralized payroll and employee benefits services to kinder morgan management  kinder morgan energy partners and kinder morgan energy partners operating partnerships and subsidiaries collectively  the group 
employees of kmgp services company  inc are assigned to work for one or more members of the group 
the direct costs of compensation  benefits expenses  employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated and charged by kinder morgan services llc to the appropriate members of the group  and the members of the group reimburse their allocated shares of these direct costs 
no profit or margin is charged by kinder morgan services llc to the members of the group 
our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services  and the related administrative costs are allocated to members of the group in accordance with existing expense allocation procedures 
the effect of these arrangements is that each member of the group bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees  as the case may be  while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs 
pursuant to the limited partnership agreement  kinder morgan energy partners provides reimbursement for its share of these administrative costs and such reimbursements are accounted for as described above 
kinder morgan energy partners reimburses kinder morgan management with respect to the costs incurred or allocated to kinder morgan management in accordance with kinder morgan energy partners limited partnership agreement  the delegation of control agreement among kinder morgan gp  inc  kinder morgan management  kinder morgan energy partners and others  and kinder morgan management s limited liability company agreement 
our named executive officers and other employees that provide management or services to both us and the group are employed by us 
additionally  other of our employees assist kinder morgan energy partners in the operation of its natural gas pipeline assets 
these employees expenses are allocated without a profit component between us and the appropriate members of the group 
we are of the opinion that  with only insignificant exceptions  we have satisfactory title to the properties owned and used in our businesses  subject to the liens for current taxes  liens incidental to minor encumbrances  and easements and restrictions which do not materially detract from the value of such property or the interests therein or the use of the properties in our businesses

general in this report  unless the context requires otherwise  references to we  us  our  or the company are intended to mean kinder morgan  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
specifically  as discussed in notes  and of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we have engaged in acquisitions including the october acquisition of kinder morgan delaware  inc  the indirect owner of the general partner interest in kinder morgan energy partners  lp  a publicly traded master limited partnership  referred to in this report as kinder morgan energy partners  and divestitures including the discontinuance of certain lines of business and the transfer of certain assets to kinder morgan energy partners that may affect comparisons of financial position and results of operations between periods 
we are a provider of energy and related services through our direct ownership and operation of energy related assets  and through our ownership interests in and operation of kinder morgan energy partners 
our energy related assets owned and operated directly which  during  are budgeted to contribute approximately of the total of our segment earnings plus earnings attributable to our investment in kinder morgan energy partners include natural gas pipelines  natural gas storage facilities  retail natural gas distribution facilities and a relatively small investment in natural gas fired power generation facilities 
our investment in kinder morgan energy partners  which  during  is budgeted to contribute approximately of the total of our segment earnings plus earnings attributable to our investment in kinder morgan energy partners includes ownership of the general partner interest  as well as ownership of limited partner units and shares of kinder morgan management  llc  referred to in this report as kinder morgan management 
as described under business strategy elsewhere in this report  our strategy and focus continues to be on ownership of fee based energy related assets which are core to the energy infrastructure of the country and serve growing markets 
these assets tend to have relatively stable cash flows while presenting us with opportunities to expand our facilities to serve additional customers and nearby markets 
we evaluate the performance of our investment in these assets using  among other measures  segment earnings 
in addition  please see developments during under items and business and properties elsewhere in this report 
the variability of our operating results is attributable to a number of factors including i variability within national and local markets for energy and related services  including the effects of competition  ii the impact of regulatory proceedings  iii the effect of weather on customer energy and related services usage  as well as our operation and construction activities  iv increases or decreases in interest rates  v the degree of our success in controlling costs and identifying and carrying out profitable expansion projects and vi changes in taxation policy or regulated rates 
certain of these factors are beyond our direct control  but we operate a structured risk management program to mitigate certain of the risks associated with changes in the price of natural gas  interest rates and weather relative to historical norms 
the remaining risks are primarily mitigated through our strategic and operational planning and monitoring processes 
see risk factors elsewhere in this report 
effective november   we contributed transcolorado gas transmission company to kinder morgan energy partners see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
our remaining businesses apart from our investment in kinder morgan energy partners constitute three business segments 
our largest business segment and our primary source of operating income is ngpl  which owns and operates a major interstate natural gas pipeline system that runs from natural gas producing areas in west texas and the gulf of mexico to its principal market area of chicago  illinois 
in accordance with our strategy to increase operational focus on core assets  we have worked toward renewing existing agreements and entering into new agreements to fully utilize the transportation and storage capacity of ngpl s system 
as a result  ngpl sold virtually all of its capacity through the winter season 
ngpl continues to pursue opportunities to expand its system and has announced transmission and storage service expansions in northeast texas and southern oklahoma expected to cost approximately million 
our other business segments consist of i our retail distribution of natural gas to approximately  customers in colorado  wyoming and nebraska and ii our investment in  in some cases  operation of  and in previous periods construction of electric power generation facilities 
our retail natural gas distribution operations are located  in part  in areas where significant population and economic growth is occurring and we expect to participate in that growth through increased natural gas demand 
our power segment owns interests in and  in some cases  operates power generation facilities  and continues to hold preferred investments in two gas fired power plants constructed by us and placed into operation in during the fourth quarter of  we announced that we were discontinuing our power development activities and we revalued certain of our power assets 
we also revalued certain of our power assets during the fourth quarters of and see power following and note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and contained within this report 
certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  the effective income tax rate to apply to our pre tax income  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  unbilled revenues for our natural gas distribution deliveries for which meters have not yet been read  exposures under contractual indemnifications and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
certain of these accounting estimates are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others 
in our retail natural gas distribution business  because we read customer meters on a cycle basis  we are required to estimate the amount of revenue earned as of the end of each period for which service has been rendered but meters have not yet been read 
we have historical information available for these meters and  together with weather related data that is indicative of natural gas demand  we are able to make reasonable estimates 
in our natural gas pipeline businesses  we are similarly required to make estimates for services rendered but for which actual metered volumes are not available at reporting dates 
as with our retail natural gas distribution business  we have historical data available to assist us in the estimation process  but the variations in volume are greater  introducing a larger possibility of error 
we believe that our estimates  which are replaced with actual metered volumes in the next accounting month  provide acceptable approximations of the actual revenue earned during any period  especially given that the majority of our revenues in the pipeline business are derived from demand charges  which do not vary with the actual amount of gas transported 
with respect to the amount of income or expense we recognize in association with our pension and retiree medical plans  we must make a number of assumptions with respect to both future financial conditions for example  medical costs  returns on fund assets and market interest rates as well as future actions by plan participants for example  when they will retire and how long they will live after retirement 
most of these assumptions have relatively minor impacts on the overall accounting recognition given to these plans  but two assumptions in particular  the discount rate and the assumed long term rate of return on fund assets  can have significant effects on the amount of expense recorded and liability recognized 
the selection of these assumptions is discussed in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
while we believe our choices for these assumptions are appropriate in the circumstances  other assumptions could also be reasonably applied and  therefore  we note that  at our current level of pension and retiree medical funding  a change of in the long term return assumption would increase decrease our annual retiree medical expense by approximately   and would increase decrease our annual pension expense by million million in comparison to that recorded in similarly  a change in the discount rate would increase decrease our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million million and would increase decrease our accumulated pension obligation by million million compared to those balances as of december  with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
these estimates are affected by the choice of remediation methods as well as the expected timing and length of the effort 
often  as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses  additional information is obtained  requiring revisions to estimated costs 
these revisions are reflected in our income in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
we are subject to litigation as the result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance  any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached 
in addition  we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed 
therefore  we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate 
changes in our effective rate  including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes  are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 
as discussed under risk management in item a of this report  we enter into derivative contracts natural gas futures  swaps and options solely for the purpose of mitigating risks that accompany our normal business activities  including fluctuations in interest rates and the price of natural gas and associated transportation 
we account for these derivative transactions as hedges in accordance with authoritative accounting guidelines  marking the derivatives to market at each reporting date  with the unrealized gains and losses either recognized as part of comprehensive income or  in the case of interest rate swaps  as a valuation adjustment to the underlying debt 
any inefficiency in the performance of the hedge is recognized in income currently and  ultimately  the financial results of the hedge are recognized concurrently with the financial results of the underlying hedged item 
all but an insignificant amount of our natural gas related derivatives are for terms of months or less  allowing us to utilize widely available  published forward pricing curves in determining all of our appropriate market values 
our interest rate swaps are similar in nature to many other such financial instruments and are valued for us by commercial banks with expertise in such valuations

results of operations we manage our various businesses by  among other things  allocating capital and monitoring operating performance 
this management process includes dividing the company into business segments so that performance can be effectively monitored and reported for a limited number of discrete businesses 
transcolorado gas transmission company was a joint venture with questar corp 
until we became sole owner by purchasing questar corp 
s interest effective october  results of operations for this segment include our share of transcolorado s earnings recognized under the equity method of accounting prior to october and consolidated results at the level thereafter until  effective november   we contributed transcolorado gas transmission company to kinder morgan energy partners see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective with the contribution  the results of operations of transcolorado gas transmission company are no longer included in our consolidated results of operations or our transcolorado business segment results 
in addition to our three remaining business segments  we derive a substantial portion of earnings from our investment in kinder morgan energy partners  which is discussed under earnings from our investment in kinder morgan energy partners following 
business segment business conducted referred to as natural gas pipeline company of america and certain affiliates the ownership and operation of a major interstate natural gas pipeline and storage system natural gas pipeline company of america  or ngpl transcolorado gas transmission company prior to its disposition on november   the ownership and operation of an interstate natural gas pipeline system in colorado and new mexico transcolorado retail natural gas distribution the regulated sale and transportation of natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers including a small distribution system in hermosillo  mexico and the sales of natural gas to certain utility customers under the choice gas program kinder morgan retail power generation the operation and  in previous periods  development and construction of natural gas fired electric generation facilities power in the fourth quarter of  as further discussed under power following  we decided to discontinue the development portion of our power generation business and decreased the carrying value of certain of our power assets 
additional reductions in the carrying value of certain power assets have been made subsequently 
the accounting policies we apply in the generation of business segment earnings are generally the same as those described in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  except that i certain items below the operating income line are either not allocated to business segments or are not considered by management in its evaluation of business segment performance and ii equity in earnings of equity method investees  other than kinder morgan energy partners and certain insignificant international investees  are included 
these equity method earnings are included in other income and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  i certain items included in operating income such as general and administrative expenses are not allocated to individual business segments and ii gains and losses from incidental sales of assets are included in segment earnings 
we account for intersegment sales at market prices  while we account for asset transfers at either market value or  in some instances  book value 
following are operating results by individual business segment before intersegment eliminations  including explanations of significant variances between the periods presented 
as necessary for comparative purposes  we have reclassified prior period results and balances to conform to the current presentation 
natural gas pipeline company of america year ended december  in thousands except systems throughput operating revenues gas purchases and other costs of sales segment earnings systems throughput trillion btus ngpl s segment earnings increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
segment earnings for were positively impacted  relative to  by i increased transportation and storage service revenues in resulting  in part  from successful re contracting of transportation capacity and the recent expansion of our storage system  ii increased margins from operational gas sales largely due to higher market prices  iii million in contractual customer penalty charges in that were billed prior to december   the effective date for ngpl s order provisions  but had been reserved pending the final outcome of its order filings see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and iv million in pre tax gains in from the sale of certain assets  principally land parcels in illinois 
these favorable impacts were partially offset by i the fact that results included increased margin associated with the favorable conclusion of a regulatory matter  ii increased operations and maintenance expenses in resulting principally from increased hydrostatic testing and electric compression costs and iii increased depreciation expense due  in part  to system expansions 
ngpl s segment results for do not include a reduction of million in interest expense attributable to the final settlement of a regulatory matter  which amount is included in interest expense  net as discussed elsewhere herein 
the decrease in overall operating revenues in  relative to  was largely the result of decreased operational gas sales volumes and revenue recorded in conjunction with the conclusion of a regulatory matter 
ngpl s operational sales are primarily made possible by its collection of fuel in kind pursuant to its transportation tariffs 
these negative impacts on revenue were partially offset by the increase in transportation and storage service revenues and contractual customer penalty charges  as discussed above 
ngpl s segment earnings increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
segment earnings for were positively impacted  relative to  by i increased margin from transportation and storage services  including operational natural gas sales  primarily resulting from expansion and extension projects coming on line during and after the end of the second quarter of as discussed below and ii increased margin associated with a regulatory matter that was concluded in these positive impacts were partially offset by increased depreciation expense related to the expansion and extension projects and increased property taxes 
as discussed above  ngpl s segment results for do not include a reduction of million in interest expense attributable to the final settlement of a regulatory matter 
the increase in overall operating revenues  which was largely offset by a corresponding increase in cost of sales  was due to increased revenues from operational natural gas sales and increased transportation and storage revenues  largely due to expansions and extensions of pipeline and storage facilities 
in the second quarter of  ngpl completed construction of bcf of storage service expansion at its existing north lansing storage facility in east texas  all of which is fully subscribed under long term contracts 
effective september   ngpl acquired the black marlin pipeline  a mile  inch pipeline that runs from bryan county  oklahoma to lamar county  texas 
the black marlin pipeline ties into ngpl s amarillo gulf coast line and increased this line s capacity by  dekatherms per day dth day 
this incremental capacity was fully subscribed in an open season under long term contracts 
ngpl has announced two projects  with a combined cost of approximately million  to expand services and flexibility on its systems 
these projects are the amarillo gulf coast and oklahoma extension capacity expansion and the sayre storage expansion 
the amarillo gulf coast and oklahoma extension capacity expansion  pending ferc approval  will add  dth day of cross haul capacity on the amarillo gulf coast line and  dth day of capacity on the oklahoma extension aka segment one 
ngpl filed for ferc approval on december  and expects service to begin during the spring of all of this incremental capacity has been subscribed under long term contracts 
the additional capacity will be added by installing additional horsepower at two compressor stations and modifying existing equipment at two other compressor stations 
as part of a separate open season  ngpl received shipper commitments for a bcf expansion of its sayre storage system in beckham county  oklahoma  pending ferc approval 
ngpl filed for ferc approval on october  and expects service to begin during the spring of this incremental capacity is fully subscribed under long term contracts 
the additional capacity will be added by drilling additional wells  installing additional compression and dehydration equipment and expanding the gathering system 
horizon pipeline company  which provides natural gas transportation capacity to the growing northern illinois market  began service in the second quarter of horizon pipeline company is a joint venture with nicor inc our equity in the earnings of horizon pipeline company was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
ngpl s lateral extension into the eastern portion of the st 
louis metropolitan area began service in the third quarter of substantially all of ngpl s pipeline capacity is committed under firm transportation contracts ranging from one to five years 
under these contracts  over of the revenues are derived from a demand charge and  therefore  are collected regardless of the volume of gas actually transported 
the principal impact of the actual level of gas transported is on fuel recoveries  which are received in kind as volumes move on the system 
approximately of the total transportation volumes committed under ngpl s long term firm transportation contracts in effect on january  had remaining terms of less than three years 
contracts representing approximately of ngpl s total long haul  contracted firm transport capacity as of january  are scheduled to expire during ngpl continues to actively pursue the renegotiation  extension and or replacement of expiring contracts 
nicor gas and peoples energy  two local gas distribution companies in the chicago  illinois area  are ngpl s two largest customers 
for  we currently expect that ngpl will experience growth in segment earnings in comparison to this increase in earnings is expected to be derived primarily from an increase in storage and firm transport revenues resulting from successful re contracting at marginally higher rates  a bcf storage expansion being placed in service in the spring of  a full year of revenue from the black marlin pipeline acquisition and increased margins from operational gas sales including incremental sales of cushion gas 
however  as discussed following  there are factors beyond our control that can affect our results  including developments in the regulatory arena and as yet unforeseen competitive developments 
accordingly  our actual future results may differ significantly from our projections 
our principal exposure to market variability is related to the variation in natural gas prices and basis differentials  which can affect gross margins in our ngpl segment 
basis differential is a term that refers to the difference in natural gas prices between two locations or two points in time 
these price differences can be affected by  among other things  natural gas supply and demand  available transportation capacity  storage inventories and deliverability  prices of alternative fuels and weather conditions 
in recent periods  additional competitive pressures have been generated in midwest natural gas markets due to the introduction and planned introduction of pipeline capacity to bring additional supplies of natural gas into the chicago market area  although incremental pipeline capacity to take gas out of the area has also been constructed 
we have attempted to reduce our exposure to this form of market variability by pursuing long term  fixed rate type contract agreements to utilize the capacity on ngpl s system 
in addition  as discussed under risk management in item a of this report and in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we utilize a comprehensive risk management program to mitigate our exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas and associated transportation 
the majority of ngpl s system is subject to rate regulation under the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission 
currently  there are no material proceedings challenging the rates which include reservation  commodity  surcharges  fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for on any of our pipeline systems 
nonetheless  shippers on our pipelines do have rights  under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations  to challenge the rates we charge 
there can be no assurance that we will not face future challenges to the rates we receive for services on our pipeline systems 
transcolorado year ended december  in thousands operating revenues gas purchases and other costs of sales segment earnings effective november  we contributed transcolorado gas transmission company to kinder morgan energy partners see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
transcolorado was a joint venture with questar corp 
until we bought questar s interest effective october   thus becoming the sole owner 
as a result  transcolorado s results shown above reflect our equity interest in its earnings prior to october   of its results on a consolidated basis from october  through october  and nothing thereafter  however  we will continue to participate in the results of operations of transcolorado through our equity investment in kinder morgan energy partners 
we recognized a million pre tax loss from the contribution of transcolorado  which is included in segment earnings  as reported above 
transcolorado s segment earnings decreased from million in to million in  principally due to the fact that results include only the ten months through october and also include the million pre tax loss from the contribution of transcolorado 
transcolorado s segment earnings increased from million in to million in results for  relative to  reflected  in addition to a full year at the increased level of ownership  the favorable impact of wide basis differentials on certain transportation contracts 
kinder morgan retail year ended december  in thousands except systems throughput operating revenues gas purchases and other costs of sales segment earnings systems throughput trillion btus kinder morgan retail s segment earnings increased by million from to this increase was due principally to i increased space heating demand in the first and fourth quarters of  ii increased grain drying demand in the fourth quarter of and iii continued customer growth in colorado 
these positive impacts were partially offset by reduced irrigation demand in the second and third quarters of and increased operations and maintenance and depreciation expenses in due  in part  to system expansion 
the increase in operating revenues in  relative to  which was largely offset by an increase in gas purchases and other costs of sales  was principally due to i higher natural gas prices in which  in general  are passed through as a component of the overall sales rate  ii the fact that a higher percentage of our wyoming customers chose us as their natural gas supplier in  either through regulated rates that pass through the cost of gas to the customer  or through our choice gas program which allows competing commodity natural gas providers to sell natural gas to customers connected to our natural gas distribution system  which increased our revenues from natural gas sales accompanied by a corresponding increase in gas purchase costs  iii increased revenues from non regulated merchandise sales and iv continued customer growth in colorado 
these positive impacts to revenues were partially offset by reduced irrigation demand in the second and third quarters of our weather hedging program continued to contribute to stability in kinder morgan retail s earnings pattern by reducing the impact of weather related demand fluctuations 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our hedging strategy 
during the second quarter of  kinder morgan retail completed and placed into service its million  mile natural gas transmission pipeline from montrose to ouray  colorado 
we expect to add about  western slope customers via this pipeline over the next five years 
kinder morgan retail s segment earnings increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
segment earnings were positively impacted in  relative to  by i increased margins resulting from a full year of our choice gas program in certain of our service territories  ii continued customer growth in existing service territories  particularly colorado  and iii reduced operations and maintenance expenses 
these positive impacts were partially offset by i reduced demand during the irrigation season  ii increased depreciation expense resulting from asset additions and iii the inclusion in results of a million property tax refund from an affiliated shipper 
the decrease in operating revenues in  relative to  principally resulted from a full year of our choice gas program in certain of our service territories  which decreased our revenues from natural gas sales accompanied by a corresponding decrease in gas purchase costs  although we continued to receive the same margin for transporting the gas 
the increase in throughput volumes in was the result of increased demand for natural gas used in space heating as a result of colder weather and continued customer growth  partially offset by lower irrigation season demand 
for  we currently expect that kinder morgan retail will experience approximately growth in segment earnings 
with a stable base of earnings due to regulated business  supplemented by a weather hedging program  increased earnings are expected to derive largely from the addition of new customers in existing service territories  especially certain high growth areas in colorado 
however  as discussed following  there are factors beyond our control that can affect our results  including developments in the regulatory arena  currently unforeseen competitive developments and weather related impacts outside our hedging program 
for these and other reasons  our actual future results may differ significantly from our projections 
a significant portion of kinder morgan retail s business is subject to rate regulation by each respective state s utility commission in colorado  wyoming and nebraska 
there are currently no material proceedings to change the base rates on any of our intrastate pipeline or distribution systems 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that we will not face future challenges to the rates we receive for these services 
kinder morgan retail is also subject to market variability in natural gas prices and basis differentials 
please refer to the discussion of basis differentials under the heading natural gas pipeline company of america in this item 
power year ended december  in thousands operating revenues gas purchases and other costs of sales segment earnings does not include i pre tax charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively  to record the impairment of certain assets  ii incremental earnings of million in reflecting the recognition of previously deferred revenues associated with construction of the jackson  michigan power generation facility  gains from the sale of surplus power generation equipment and the settlement of certain litigation 
results for exclude a pre tax loss of million resulting from the sale of natural gas reserves by an equity method investee 
these items are discussed below 
due to the adoption of a recently issued accounting standard  the results of operations of our triton power affiliates are included in our consolidated operating results and in the results of our power segment beginning in although the results of triton have an impact on the total operating revenues and expenses of the power business segment  after taking into account the associated minority interests  the consolidation of triton had no effect on power s segment earnings 
power s segment earnings  as reported above  decreased by million from to segment earnings for were negatively impacted  relative to  primarily because results included million in development fees for the jackson  michigan power plant 
certain surplus power generation equipment was sold during and see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recorded million of pre tax gains from these sales in  which are excluded from segment earnings as reported above 
in addition  we recorded revenues of million and million in resulting from development fees associated with the jackson  michigan power plant and the favorable settlement of litigation matters  respectively  which are excluded from the tabular presentation of segment earnings as reported above 
segment revenues and segment earnings  as reported above  decreased by million and million  respectively  from to these decreases were expected  and principally resulted from reduced development fees due to the completed construction of the jackson  michigan and wrightsville  arkansas power plants  as well as our decision to exit the power development business 
this decision is discussed below  as well as the reductions we have recorded in the carrying value of certain of our power investments 
in february  kinder morgan power announced an agreement under which williams energy marketing and trading agreed to supply natural gas to and market capacity for years for a megawatt natural gas fired orion technology electric power plant in jackson  michigan 
effective july   construction of this facility was completed and commercial operations commenced 
concurrently with commencement of commercial operations  i kinder morgan power made a preferred investment in triton power company llc now valued at approximately million  and ii triton power company llc  through its wholly owned subsidiary  triton power michigan llc  entered into a year lease of the jackson power facility from the plant owner  alphagen power  llc 
williams energy marketing and trading supplies all natural gas to and purchases all power from the power plant under a year tolling agreement with triton power michigan llc 
our preferred equity interest has no management or voting rights  but does retain certain protective rights  and is entitled to a cumulative return  compounded monthly  of per annum 
no income was recorded in and no income is expected in from this preferred investment due to the fact that the dividend on this preferred is not currently being paid  and uncertainty concerning the date at which such distributions will be received 
in may  kinder morgan power and mirant corporation formerly southern energy inc announced plans to build a megawatt natural gas fired electric power plant in wrightsville  arkansas  utilizing kinder morgan power s orion technology 
construction of this facility was completed on july  and commercial operations commenced 
mirant corporation operates and maintains the wrightsville facility and manages the natural gas supply and electricity sales for the project company that owns the power plant 
kinder morgan power made an investment in the project company  comprised primarily of preferred stock 
this facility has not been dispatched significantly since july  and  while the dispatch decision is made by mirant and not by us  we believe that dispatch has not occurred largely due to unfavorable economic circumstances surrounding the market for the power that would be generated 
during the third quarter of  we announced that mirant had placed the wrightsville  arkansas plant in bankruptcy in october  and we would assess the long term prospects for this facility during the fourth quarter 
in december  we completed our analysis and determined that it was no longer appropriate to assign any carrying value to our investment in this facility and recorded a million pre tax charge  effectively writing off our remaining investment in the wrightsville power facility 
this charge is excluded from the tabular presentation of segment earnings as reported above 
during  we noted that a number of factors had negatively affected power s business environment and certain of its current operations 
these factors  which are currently expected to continue in the near to intermediate term  include i volatile and generally declining prices for wholesale electric power in certain markets  ii cancellation and or postponement of the construction of a number of new power generation facilities  iii difficulty in obtaining air permits with acceptable operating conditions and constraints and iv a marked deterioration in the financial condition of a number of participants in the power generating and marketing business  including participants in the power plants in jackson  michigan and wrightsville  arkansas 
during the fourth quarter of  after completing an analysis of these and other factors to determine their impact on the market value of these assets and the prospects for this business in the future  we i determined that we would no longer pursue power development activities and ii recorded a million pre tax charge to reduce the carrying value of our investments in sites for future power plant development  power plants and turbines and associated equipment 
this charge is excluded from the tabular presentation of segment earnings as reported above 
since  we have had an investment in a megawatt gas fired power generation facility located in greeley  colorado 
we became concerned with the value of this investment as a result of several recent circumstances including the expiration of a gas purchase contract  the amendment of the associated power purchase agreement and uncertainties surrounding the management of this facility  which has changed ownership twice in the last one and one half years 
these ownership changes made it difficult for us to obtain information necessary to forecast the future of this asset 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that we had sufficient information to determine that our investment had been impaired and  accordingly  reduced our carrying value by million 
this charge is excluded from the tabular presentation of segment earnings as reported above 
during and  we sold six of our surplus turbines and certain associated equipment  including certain equipment to kinder morgan energy partners see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
recognizing the effects of changes in technology and the limited improvement of the general economies of the electric generation industry  we determined that the carrying values of our remaining turbines and associated equipment should be reduced 
in the fourth quarter of  we reduced the carrying value of these assets by million 
this charge is excluded from segment earnings as reported above 
we are continuing our efforts to sell the remaining inventory of surplus turbines and associated equipment  which had a carrying value of million at december  pursuant to a right we obtained in conjunction with the acquisition of the thermo companies  in december  we made an additional investment in our colorado power businesses in the form of approximately million kinder morgan management shares that we owned 
we delivered these shares to an entity controlled by the former thermo owners  which entity is required to retain the shares until they vest  shares will vest each january of  and  with the remainder vesting on january  
we will continue to receive distributions made by kinder morgan management attributable to the unvested shares 
we recorded our increased investment based on the third party determined million fair value of the shares as of the contribution date  with a corresponding liability representing our obligation to deliver vested shares in the future 
the effect of this incremental investment will be to increase our ownership interest in the thermo entities beginning in we expect that segment earnings from power will decline by an insignificant amount 
actual future results may differ significantly from our projections 
earnings from our investment in kinder morgan energy partners the impact on our pre tax earnings from our investment in kinder morgan energy partners was as follows year ended december  in thousands general partner interest  including minority interest in the operating limited partnerships limited partner units kinder morgan energy partners limited partner i units kinder morgan management pre tax minority interest in kinder morgan management pre tax earnings from investment in kinder morgan energy partners for  pre tax earnings attributable to our investment in kinder morgan energy partners are expected to increase by approximately due to  among other factors  improved performance from existing assets

this increase was principally due to i increased equity in the earnings of kinder morgan energy partners due  in part  to acquisitions made and strong performance from the assets held by kinder morgan energy partners  ii decreased interest expense  reflecting reduced debt outstanding offset by a slight increase in interest rates and iii a million increase in gains from sales of assets see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements

income taxes continuing operations the income tax provision decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million

the reduction in the effective tax rate from to was principally due to a decrease in the component of the overall estimated effective tax rate attributable to state income taxes resulting from  among other factors  changes in apportionment of consolidated taxable income among the various states 
the income tax provision increased from million in to million in  an increase of million due mainly to an increase of million in income from continuing operations before income taxes

income taxes realization of deferred tax assets at december   we had a capital loss carryforward of approximately million 
a capital loss carryforward can be utilized to reduce capital gain during the five years succeeding the year in which a capital loss is incurred 
the amounts and the years in which our capital loss carryforward expires are million during  million during and million during management has concluded that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized through the sale of assets which will generate sufficient capital gain to fully utilize the capital loss carryforward during the periods specified above 
management has identified our limited partner interests in kinder morgan energy partners  lp and our common stock ownership in kinder morgan management as specific assets that could be sold to generate capital gain 
management intends to sell between million and million of our approximate million kinder morgan management shares to achieve utilization of the capital loss carryforward 
no valuation allowance has been provided with respect to this deferred tax asset 
discontinued operations during  we adopted and implemented plans to discontinue the following lines of business i gathering and processing of natural gas  including short haul intrastate pipelines and providing field services to natural gas producers  ii wholesale marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids  iii international operations and iv the direct marketing of non energy products and services 
during  we completed the disposition of these businesses  with the exception of international operations principally consisting of a natural gas distribution system in hermosillo  mexico which  in the fourth quarter of  we decided to retain 
during the fourth quarters of and  we recorded incremental losses of approximately million and million net of tax benefits of million and million  respectively  to increase previously recorded liabilities to reflect updated estimates and reflect the impact of settled litigation 
we had a remaining liability of approximately million at december  associated with these discontinued operations  representing legal obligations and an indemnification obligation associated with our sale of assets to oneok  inc we do not expect significant additional financial impacts associated with these matters 
note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contains certain additional financial information with respect to these discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources primary cash requirements our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating  general and administrative expenses  are for debt service  capital expenditures  common stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends to our common shareholders 
our capital expenditures other than sustaining capital expenditures  our common stock repurchases and our quarterly cash dividends to our common shareholders are discretionary 
our capital expenditures for are currently expected to be approximately million 
we expect to fund these expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from operations  we could meet these cash requirements through borrowings under our credit facilities  issuing short term commercial paper  long term notes or additional shares of common stock 
invested capital the following table illustrates the sources of our invested capital 
our ratio of total debt to total capital has declined significantly in recent periods 
this decline has resulted from a number of factors  including our increased cash flows from operations as discussed under cash flows following 
in recent periods  we have significantly increased our dividends per share and have announced our intention to consider further increases on an annual basis  and we maintain an ongoing program to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
for these reasons  among others  any declines in our ratio of total debt to total capital in the future may be smaller 
in addition to the direct sources of debt and equity financing shown in the following table  we obtain financing indirectly through our ownership interests in unconsolidated entities as shown under significant financing transactions following 
our largest such unconsolidated investment is in kinder morgan energy partners 
see investment in kinder morgan energy partners following 
in addition to our results of operations  these balances are affected by our financing activities as discussed following

we place no restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities  payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies 
in addition  ngpl is subject to ferc enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs 
ferc regulated entities subject to these rules must  among other things  place their cash management agreements in writing  maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements  and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc

we currently do not expect to make significant contributions to these plans in the next few years  although we could elect or be required to make such contributions depending on  among other factors  the return generated by plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions 
the million in letters of credit outstanding at december  consisted of the following i four letters of credit  totaling million  required under provisions of our property and casualty  worker s compensation and general liability insurance policies  ii a million letter of credit supporting the subordination of operating fees payable to us for operation of the jackson  michigan power generation facility to payments due under the operating lease of the facilities  iii a million letter of credit associated with the outstanding debt of thermo cogeneration partnership  lp  the entity responsible for the operation of our colorado power generation assets and iv a million letter of credit supporting thermo cogeneration partnership  lp s performance under its contract with public service company of colorado  the principal customer of our colorado power generation assets

investment in kinder morgan energy partners at december   we owned  directly  and indirectly in the form of i units corresponding to the number of shares of kinder morgan management  approximately million limited partner units of kinder morgan energy partners 
these units  which consist of million common units  million class b units and million i units  represent approximately of the total limited partner interests of kinder morgan energy partners

cash flows the following discussion of cash flows should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and related supplemental disclosures 
all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
net cash flows from operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
this positive variance is principally due to i a million increase in cash distributions received in attributable to our interest in kinder morgan energy partners see the discussion following  ii a million reduction in cash paid for interest during  iii a million decrease in cash paid for income taxes during and iv an increase of million in cash attributable to the change in the balance of deferred purchased gas costs 
cash flows attributable to deferred purchased gas costs vary with the relationship between the amount actually paid for natural gas and the amount currently included in regulated rates 
this difference is recovered or refunded through subsequent rate adjustments 
these positive impacts were partially offset by  i a decrease of million in cash inflows for gas in underground storage during and ii the fact that included million of cash proceeds received from termination of an interest rate swap see significant financing transactions for further information regarding this transaction 
significant period to period variations in cash used or generated from gas in storage transactions are due to changes in injection and withdrawal volumes as well as fluctuations in natural gas prices 
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
this positive variance is principally due to i a million increase in cash distributions received in attributable to our interests in kinder morgan energy partners  ii million of cash proceeds received in from termination of an interest rate swap  iii an increase of million in cash inflows from gas in underground storage during  iv a million decrease in cash outflows during for pension contributions in excess of expense and v the fact that cash flows in included million of cash outflows for a litigation settlement

summarized financial information for kinder morgan energy partners is contained in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash flows from investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million 
this decreased use of cash is principally due to i million of proceeds received from kinder morgan energy partners in for the contribution of transcolorado  ii million of additional proceeds received for sales of surplus natural gas fired turbines and boilers in and iii the fact that included million of expenditures for other investments  partially offset by i an additional million investment in kinder morgan energy partners during  which primarily consisted of kinder morgan management s purchase of additional i units from kinder morgan energy partners with the proceeds of an issuance of its shares as discussed under net cash flows from financing activities following  ii the fact that included an additional million of net proceeds from sales of other assets  iii additional capital expenditures of million during and iv an increase of million in investments in margin deposits associated with hedging activities utilizing energy derivative instruments 
net cash flows used in investing activities decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million 
this decreased use of cash is principally due to the fact that included i a million investment in i units of kinder morgan energy partners  ii a million cash outflow for investments in power plant facilities  iii payment of million net of cash acquired for the acquisition of the remaining interest in the transcolorado interstate pipeline system  iv million in capital expenditures for the ngpl pipeline extension to east st 
louis  illinois  v million for acquisition of the sayre natural gas storage facility and vi a million investment in horizon pipeline company 
net cash flows from financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
this increase is principally due to i a million reduction in short term debt in as compared to incremental short term borrowings of million in  ii million of cash used in for the early retirement of our million debentures due october  see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  iii a million increase in cash paid for common stock dividends in  principally due to the increased dividends declared per share see discussion following in this section  iv a million decreased source of cash from short term advances to unconsolidated affiliates during and v a million increase in cash paid during to repurchase our common shares 
partially offsetting these factors were i the fact that included million of cash used to retire our senior notes  ii million of proceeds  net of issuance costs  from the issuance of kinder morgan management shares in and iii an increase of million received in for issuance of our common stock  principally as a result of the exercise of employee stock options 
net cash flows used in provided by financing activities decreased from a source of million in to a use of million in  an increased net cash use of million 
this increased net use of cash was principally due to i million of cash used in to retire our senior notes  ii an increase of million paid in for common stock dividends  principally due to the increased dividends declared per share and iii the fact that included proceeds  net of issuance costs  of million from the issuance of kinder morgan management shares and million of net proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes due september  partially offsetting these factors were i a million increase during in cash flows related to short term borrowing  ii the fact that included cash used for repayment of million of floating rate notes and million for the early retirement of our debentures due september  and our sinking fund debentures due september  see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  iii a million decreased use of cash during to repurchase our common shares and iv a million increased source of cash from net repayment of short term advances to unconsolidated affiliates during total cash payments for dividends were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in these amounts are principally due to increases in the dividends declared per common share and  to a minor extent  to increased shares outstanding 
in january  we increased our quarterly common dividend to per share annualized 
on february   we paid a dividend at the increased rate of per share to shareholders of record as of january as discussed under business strategy elsewhere in this report  our intention is to maintain a capital structure that provides stability and flexibility  while returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
in recent periods  we have increased our common stock dividends in response to changes in income tax laws that have made dividends a more efficient way to return cash to our shareholders 
our board of directors generally considers our dividend policy in conjunction with its january meeting and has recently shown a pattern of increasing dividends  although the board determines dividend policy on an annual basis 
the board considers a number of factors in reaching its decision with respect to dividend policy including our historical and projected cash flows  our expected allocation of funds to share repurchases and  as discussed above  changes in laws that may affect the taxation of dividends to our shareholders 
we currently expect that our cash flows will be adequate to maintain at least our current level of dividends for  although changes in our economic circumstances  in the economic circumstances of our industry or of the economy in general could cause the board to reconsider our dividend policy at any time 
litigation and environmental our anticipated environmental capital costs and expenses for  including expected costs for remediation efforts  are approximately million  compared to approximately million of such costs and expenses incurred in we had an environmental reserve of approximately million at december   to address remediation issues associated with approximately projects 
this reserve has not been discounted or reduced for expected insurance recoveries 
our reserve estimates range in value from approximately million to million  and the lower end of the range has been accrued as no amount within the range is considered more likely than any other 
in addition  we have recorded a receivable of million for expected cost recoveries that have been deemed probable 
our reserve is primarily established to address and clean up soil and ground water impacts from former releases to the environment at facilities we have acquired 
reserves for each project are generally established by reviewing existing documents  conducting interviews and performing site inspections to determine the overall size and impact to the environment 
reviews are made on a quarterly basis to determine the status of the cleanup and the costs associated with the effort and to identify if the reserve allocation is appropriately valued 
in assessing environmental risks in conjunction with proposed acquisitions  we review records relating to environmental issues  conduct site inspections  interview employees  and  if appropriate  collect soil and groundwater samples 
after consideration of reserves established  we believe that costs for environmental remediation and ongoing compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial position or results of operations or diminish our ability to operate our businesses 
however  there can be no assurances that future events  such as changes in existing laws  the promulgation of new laws  or the development or discovery of new or existing facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant unanticipated costs 
refer to notes a and b of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pending environmental and litigation matters  respectively 
we believe we have established adequate environmental and legal reserves such that the resolution of pending environmental matters and litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
however  changing circumstances could cause these matters to have a material adverse impact 
regulation the pipeline safety improvement act of was signed into law on december   providing guidelines in the areas of testing  education  training and communication 
the act requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as high consequence areas 
pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests within ten years of the date of enactment and must perform subsequent integrity tests on a seven year cycle 
at least of the highest risk segments must be tested within five years of the enactment date 
the risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
testing consists of hydrostatic testing  internal electronic testing  or direct assessment of the piping 
in addition to the pipeline integrity tests  pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained 
the united states department of transportation has approved our qualification program 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with this law s requirements and have integrated appropriate aspects of this pipeline safety law into our operator qualification program  which is already in place and functioning 
ngpl estimates that the average annual incremental expenditure associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of is approximately million to million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information on our risk management activities 
our derivative activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  collectively  statement we enter into derivative contracts solely for the purpose of hedging exposures that accompany our normal business activities 
in accordance with the provisions of statement  we designated these instruments as hedges of various exposures as discussed following  and we test the effectiveness of changes in the value of these hedging instruments in offsetting the risk being hedged 
hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in income in the period in which it occurs 
we enter into these transactions only with counterparties whose debt securities are rated investment grade by the major rating agencies 
while we will continue to enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
our businesses require that we purchase  sell and consume natural gas 
specifically  we purchase  sell and or consume natural gas i to serve our regulated natural gas distribution sales customers  ii to serve certain of our retail natural gas distribution customers in areas where regulatory restructuring has provided for competition in natural gas supply  for customers who have selected the company as their supplier of choice under our choice gas program  iii as fuel in one of our colorado power generation facilities  iv as fuel for compressors located on ngpl s pipeline system and v for operational sales of gas by ngpl 
with respect to item i  we have no commodity risk because the regulated retail gas distribution regulatory structure provides that actual gas cost is passed through to our customers 
with respect to item iii  our exposure is minimal and primarily consists of basis rather than commodity risk 
with respect to item iv  this fuel is supplied by in kind fuel recoveries that are part of the transportation tariff 
items ii and v give rise to natural gas commodity price risk  which we have chosen to substantially mitigate through our risk management program  utilizing financial derivative products 
under our choice gas program  customers in certain areas served by kinder morgan retail are allowed to choose their natural gas supplier from a list of qualified suppliers  although the transportation of the natural gas to the homes and businesses continues to be provided by kinder morgan retail in all cases 
when those customers choose kinder morgan retail as their choice gas supplier  we enter into agreements providing for sales of gas to these customers during a one year period at fixed prices per unit  but variable volumes 
we mitigate the risk associated with these anticipated sales of gas by purchasing natural gas futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange nymex and  as applicable  over the counter basis swaps to mitigate the risk associated with the difference in price changes between henry hub nymex basis and the expected physical delivery location 
in addition  we mitigate a portion of the volumetric risk through the purchase of over the counter natural gas options 
the time period covered by this risk management strategy does not extend beyond one year 
with respect to operational sales of natural gas made by ngpl  we are exposed to risk associated with changes in the price of natural gas during the periods in which these sales are made 
we mitigate this risk by selling natural gas futures and  as discussed above  over the counter basis swaps  on the nymex in the periods in which we expect to make these sales 
in general  we do not hedge this exposure for periods in excess of months 
we use a value at risk model to measure the risk of price changes in the crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids markets 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the marked to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we use a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
our value at risk computations use a confidence level of for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk amount presented 
during  value at risk reached a high of million and a low of million 
value at risk at december   was million and  based on quarter end values  averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed preceding  we enter into these derivatives solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany our normal business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivatives is  with the exception of a minor amount of hedging inefficiency  offset by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 
during the three years ended december   all of our natural gas derivative activities were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges 
we recognized a pre tax loss of approximately  in  a pre tax gain of approximately  in and a pre tax loss of approximately  in as a result of ineffectiveness of these hedges  which amounts are reported within the caption gas purchases and other costs of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
there was no component of these derivative instruments gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
as the hedged sales and purchases take place and we record them into earnings  we also reclassify the gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 
we expect to reclassify into earnings  during  substantially all of the balance of approximately  in accumulated other comprehensive income representing unrecognized net losses on derivative activities at december  during the three years ended december   we reclassified no gains or losses into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges due to a determination that the forecasted transactions would no longer occur by the end of the originally specified time period 
we also provide certain administrative risk management services to kinder morgan energy partners  although kinder morgan energy partners retains the obligations and rights arising from all derivative transactions entered into on its behalf 
our business activities expose us to credit risk with respect to collection of accounts receivable 
in order to mitigate that risk  we routinely monitor the credit status of our existing and potential customers 
when customers credit ratings do not meet our requirements for the extension of unsupported credit  we obtain cash prepayments or letters of credit 
note g of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements provides information on the amount of prepayments we have received 
we have outstanding fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of billion at december  these agreements  entered into in august  september and november  effectively convert the interest expense associated with our debentures due in and our senior notes due in from fixed rates to floating rates based on the three month london interbank offered rate libor plus a credit spread 
these swaps have been designated as fair value hedges and we have accounted for them utilizing the shortcut method prescribed for qualifying fair value hedges under statement accordingly  the carrying value of the swap is adjusted to its fair value as of the end of each reporting period  and an offsetting entry is made to adjust the carrying value of the debt securities whose fair value is being hedged 
the fair value of these swaps of million at december  is included in the caption deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we record interest expense equal to the floating rate payments  which is accrued monthly and paid semi annually 
based on the long term debt effectively converted to floating rate debt as a result of the swaps discussed above  the market risk related to a change in interest rates would result in a million annual impact on pre tax income 
on march   we terminated the interest rate swap agreements associated with our senior notes due in and received million 
we are amortizing this amount reducing interest expense over the remaining period the senior notes are outstanding 
the unamortized balance of million at december  is included in the caption value of interest rate swaps under the heading long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
