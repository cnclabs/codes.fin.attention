item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts results of operations overview fiscal year net sales gross margin diluted eps net income net income as a of sales revenue declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of an inventory correction at our customers in the ate  or automatic test equipment  and wireless handset markets during the fiscal year 
gross margins declined by basis points primarily as a result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production 
we recorded special charges of million in accordance with our restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  of which million related to severance costs associated with the closure of our california wafer fabrication facility and million related to severance costs associated with a reorganization of our product development and support programs 
during fiscal  we repatriated  million of accumulated foreign earnings 
under current tax law  the earnings repatriated prior to october  were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate 
as a result of this action  we recorded additional income tax expenses of million in fiscal we generated cash flow from operations of million during fiscal  repurchased million of our common stock and paid million in cash dividends 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance increased by million during fiscal to  million at october  on october   we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options granted after december  awarded to employees under our stock option plans that had exercise prices of or greater 
the vesting terms of options issued to corporate officers and directors were not accelerated 
unvested options to purchase approximately million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration 
because the exercise price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of their modification  no compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the primary purpose for modifying the terms of these options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non cash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these options as measured under sfas revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas r 
the approximately million million net of tax of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification 
we are required to adopt sfas r effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal and we will be required to record compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of income  rather than in a pro forma footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue net sales declined million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decline was primarily the result of a decrease in orders for products used in communications applications due to weakness in the wireless handset end markets 
sales to customers in the industrial market decreased as a result of an inventory correction at our customers in the automatic test equipment market in the first half of fiscal sales to customers in the computer end market decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal these decreases were partially offset by a increase in sales to customers in the consumer end market 

table of contents for fiscal  net sales increased million  or  from fiscal this increase in net sales in fiscal was a result of what we believed was a broad based increase in demand for our products used in every end market we serve 
increased demand for our products used in industrial products and communications products accounted for approximately of this year to year increase  and increased demand for our products used in consumer and computer end markets accounted for the remaining increase in net sales 
increased demand for our products used in wireless handsets and infrastructure was the main reason for our increased sales in the communications end market 
over the last three fiscal years  net sales from analog products were approximately of net sales and sales of dsp products represented approximately of net sales 
in fiscal  analog product sales decreased and dsp product sales decreased from the levels recorded in fiscal in fiscal  analog product sales increased and dsp product sales increased from the levels recorded in fiscal the percentage of sales by geographic region  based upon point of sale  for the last three years is as follows fiscal year region north america europe japan china rest of asia the percentage of our net sales in china as a percentage of our total sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as the result of the changes in sales into the wireless handset end markets 
gross margin fiscal year gross margin gross margin gross margin declined in fiscal by basis points from the gross margin in fiscal the decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production 
gross margin improved in fiscal by basis points from the gross margin in fiscal the improvement in gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level and  to a lesser extent  the impact of restructuring actions taken in previous years as well as continued tight cost control at our manufacturing operations 
research and development fiscal year research and development r d expenses r d expenses as a of net sales r d expenses for fiscal decreased by million  or  from the amount recorded in fiscal this decrease was caused by a million reduction in employee bonus expenses and reductions in other expenses of million as a result of our tight control over all other engineering expenses throughout the year 

table of contents these expense reductions were partially offset by a million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses 
r d expenses increased by million  or in fiscal from the amount recorded in fiscal this increase was primarily due to additional salary and benefit costs associated with a increase in engineering headcount during the year as well as annual salary increases and increased bonus payments and  to a lesser extent  an increase in other engineering expenses reflecting the increased r d activity during the year 
r d expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts  which we view as critical to our future growth 
at any point in time we have hundreds of r d projects underway  and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis 
we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products  and we believe that a continued commitment to r d is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore  we expect to continue to make significant r d investments in the future

these expense reductions were partially offset by a million increase in salary and employee benefit costs 
smg a expenses increased in fiscal by million  or  from the levels recorded in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased salary and employee benefit expenses  increased employee bonus expenses  increased commission payments as a result of the year to year increase in net sales and  to a lesser extent  increased legal costs associated with patent and intellectual property activity and other expense increases associated with selling and marketing activities 
special charges fiscal closure of wafer fabrication facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of a decision to close our california wafer fabrication operations and transfer production to facilities located in massachusetts and ireland  as well as to third party wafer fabricators 
the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to our ongoing benefit plan for manufacturing employees and general and administrative employees 
as of october   the employment of none of these employees had been terminated 
in addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expect to incur additional expenses related to this action during fiscal these additional charges will consist of approximately million of non cash cost of sales expense for additional depreciation due to the shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment  approximately million for stay on bonuses and approximately million for estimated lease termination and clean up costs 
the closure of these facilities is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal and is estimated to result in cost savings of approximately million per year beginning in fiscal these savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately million in cost of sales  of which approximately million relates to non cash depreciation savings  and approximately million in selling  marketing  general and administrative expense 
reorganization of product development and support programs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product 
table of contents development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and dsp product programs 
the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for manufacturing employees and engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees 
as of october   the employment of of these employees had been terminated 
in addition to this charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expect to incur approximately million of additional expenses related to this action during fiscal the additional expenses relate to facilities closure costs and estimated lease termination costs 
most of this action is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal and will be fully completed by the end of fiscal these organizational changes are expected to result in savings of approximately million per year once fully completed by the end of fiscal these savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately million in research and development expense  approximately million in selling  marketing  general and administrative expense and approximately million in cost of sales 
special charges fiscal fiscal fourth quarter special charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in belfast  northern ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications 
the charge included million of severance and fringe benefit costs for approximately manufacturing employees and engineering and administrative employees all of which had been paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the charge also included million related to the write down of property  plant and equipment to its fair value and million related to the write down of various other assets to their fair values 
the closure was completed during the second quarter of fiscal fiscal third quarter special charge during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million 
the charge included a million write down of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in plastic packages  which had been done internally at our facility in the philippines 
this amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly  net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets 
we also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the write down of million of equipment to its fair value 
during the quarter ended august   we determined that costs remaining to be paid for certain previous restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded  and accordingly  we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by million 
operating income fiscal year operating income operating income as a of net sales the decrease in operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of a year to year decrease in net sales  a basis point year to year decrease in gross margin combined with a million special charge in fiscal year partially offset by operating expense decreases 
the increase in operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of the basis point year to year improvement in gross margin offset by operating expense increases that were limited to  which was less than half the increase in net sales for the year 

table of contents nonoperating income and expense fiscal year interest expense interest income other income expense  net the year to year increase in interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to higher interest rates as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board  as well as higher average invested cash balances 
the year to year decrease in interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to lower average invested cash balances in fiscal due to the note redemption in this was partially mitigated by our decision in fiscal to increase our holdings of longer term  high credit quality bonds  which offer higher yields than shorter term investments  and higher interest rates later in fiscal as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board 
fiscal included interest expense for our  million convertible subordinated notes that we redeemed on october  provision for income taxes fiscal year provision for income taxes effective income tax rate on october   the american jobs creation act of  or the ajca  was signed into law 
the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
during fiscal  we repatriated  million of accumulated foreign earnings 
under current tax law  the earnings repatriated prior to october  were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate 
as a result of this action  we recorded additional income tax expense of million in fiscal we had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the m limitation of the internal revenue code would not withdraw their balances from the analog devices  inc deferred compensation plan  or the deferred compensation plan  while they were still subject to the m limitation  and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal  generally upon their retirement 
due to recent changes in tax law that were enacted as part of the ajca  the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans have changed 
as a result  three executive officers who are currently subject to the m limitation have either withdrawn  or have indicated their intention to withdraw  a portion of their balances from the deferred compensation plan 
we incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal of million as a result of the write off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our deferred compensation plan 
net income fiscal year net income net income as a of net sales diluted eps net income decreased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of the year to year decrease in net sales  a million tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings and million of special charges recorded in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in interest income 

table of contents net income increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the improvement in net income in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the year to year increase in net sales  and  to a lesser extent  the improvement in operating income as a percentage of net sales from recorded in fiscal to recorded in fiscal the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
related party transaction one of our directors  who has been a director since  became a director of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  in fiscal we purchased approximately million  million and million of products from tsmc in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those that could be obtained from unaffiliated parties 
approximately million and million were payable to tsmc as of october  and october   respectively 
we anticipate that we will make significant purchases from tsmc in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources fiscal year net cash provided by operations net cash provided by operations as a of net sales during fiscal  net cash provided by operations decreased by million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to a decline in net income of million 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million during fiscal this increase was the result of million of cash flow from operations  million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs and million of cash inflows from the net change in our short term available for sale investments 
these cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of million of our common stock  the payment of million of cash dividends and additions to property  plant and equipment of million 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million during fiscal to  million at october  during fiscal  net cash provided by operations increased by million from the amount recorded in the prior year primarily due to the year to year increase in net income of million 
during fiscal  we received million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs 
these cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of million of our common stock  additions to property  plant and equipment of million and our payment of cash dividends of million in fiscal cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million during fiscal to  million at october  fiscal year accounts receivable days sales outstanding inventory days cost of sales in inventory accounts receivable at the end of fiscal decreased by million  or  from the amount at the end of fiscal this decrease was the result of a lower amount of shipments in the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal inventories decreased by million  or  and days cost of sales in inventory declined by days during fiscal this decrease was the result of our aggressive management of spending related to back end 
table of contents manufacturing and fabricated wafer purchases from external foundries and a modest adjustment of our internal capacity 
recent changes in tax law that were enacted as part of the ajca  had the effect that distributions from the deferred compensation plan after january  could be subject to more stringent tax laws 
as a result  some participants have elected to withdraw  or indicated their intention to withdraw  a portion  or all  of their balance from the deferred compensation plan prior to december  accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  million of our non current deferred compensation plan investments and the offsetting liability became current 
net additions to property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
during fiscal  our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of million in fiscal the payment of future dividends  if any  will be based on several factors including our financial performance  outlook and liquidity 
after the end of the fiscal year  on november   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of our common stock 
the dividend is payable on december  to shareholders of record on november  and is expected to be approximately million 
on may   our board of directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our board of directors on august  from million to billion 
we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
management will determine the timing and amount of share repurchases 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million of our common stock under this plan 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million of our common stock under this plan 
our previous repurchase program announced on august  was terminated by resolution of our board of directors on august  the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of october  payment due by period less than more than thousands total year years years years contractual obligations operating leases a deferred compensation plan b pension funding c total a certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses 
these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table 
b these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation 
prior to january   participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before july  the payment obligations reflected in the table include the planned distributions from the deferred compensation plan for the portion of the investments that participants have indicated their intention  prior to october   to have distributed from the deferred compensation plan within a year 
the amount in the more than years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who  prior to october   have not terminated employment or indicated their intention to withdraw their balances 
since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment or indicated their 
table of contents intention to withdraw their balances  we have included the future obligation to these participants in the more than years column of the table 
c our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country 
the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance  interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
in addition  our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements 
the expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 
at october   our principal source of liquidity was  million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet financing as of october   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
tentative settlement of the sec s previously announced stock option investigation in our form k filing dated november   we disclosed that the securities and exchange commission sec had initiated an inquiry into our stock option granting practices  focusing on options that were granted shortly before the issuance of favorable financial results 
on november   we announced that a tentative settlement has been reached 
since receiving notice of this inquiry  we have been cooperating with the sec and believe that the matter will be concluded in the near future 
we and our president and ceo  mr 
jerald g 
fishman  have made an offer of settlement to the staff of the sec  which is subject to agreement regarding the specific language of the sec s administrative order and other settlement documents 
the sec staff has decided to recommend the offer of settlement to the commission 
a final settlement is subject to review and approval by the commission 
our board of directors and mr 
fishman  believe that it is in the best interests of our shareholders to settle this case on the proposed terms rather than face a protracted dispute with the sec 
the contemplated settlement addresses two separate issues 
the first issue concerns our disclosure regarding grants of options to our employees and directors prior to the release of favorable financial results 
specifically  the issue relates to options granted to our employees including officers on november  and to employees including officers and directors on november  the sec settlement would conclude that we should have made disclosures in our proxy filings to the effect that we priced these stock options prior to releasing favorable financial results 
the second issue addressed by the tentative settlement concerns the grant dates for options granted to our employees including officers in and  and the grant date for options granted to employees including officers and directors in specifically  the settlement would conclude that the appropriate grant date for the september  options should have been september th which is one trading day later than the date that was used to price the options  the appropriate grant date for the november  
table of contents options should have been november th which is one trading day earlier than the date that was used  and the appropriate grant date for the july  options should have been july th which is five trading days after the original date 
in connection with the contemplated settlement  we would consent to a cease and desist order under section b of the securities exchange act and rule b thereunder  would pay a civil money penalty of million  and would reprice options granted to mr 
fishman and other directors in certain years 
options granted to all other employees would be excluded from the repricing 
mr 
fishman would consent to a cease and desist order under sections a and of the securities act  would pay a civil money penalty of million  and would make a disgorgement payment with respect to options granted in certain years 
with the exception of options granted in  mr 
fishman has not exercised or sold any of the options identified in this matter 
we and mr 
fishman would settle this matter without admitting or denying the commission s findings 
we have determined that no restatement of our historical financial results would be necessary due to the proposed settlement  because the effects of using revised measurement dates for options granted in  and are not material to any of the fiscal years through  based on the materiality guidelines contained in sab if a stock based compensation charge had been taken as a result of the revised measurement dates for these option grants to all employees including officers and directors  our net income for fiscal years through would have been reduced by million in total 
during this period  we earned cumulative net income of over billion 
there would be no impact on revenue  cash flow from operations  or shareholders equity as a result of using the revised measurement dates 
the impact on net income in individual fiscal years would have been as follows fiscal million  fiscal million  fiscal million  fiscal million  fiscal million  fiscal million  fiscal million 
outlook we are planning for revenue in the first quarter of fiscal to be similar to the levels recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal with the adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal  we estimate that stock based compensation expense will have an impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately in the first quarter of fiscal including this stock based compensation expense we expect diluted earnings per share to be approximately for the first quarter of fiscal new accounting pronouncements accounting changes and error corrections in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
asset retirements in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies that the term 
table of contents conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  we are currently analyzing fin and believe the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
nonmonetary assets in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 sfas 
sfas is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal did not impact our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
inventory costs in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no  chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas and do not believe that its adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
stock based compensation on december   the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
the modified prospective method recognizes compensation cost beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate their historical financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a for all prior periods presented or b for prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on our results of 
table of contents operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
sfas r is required to be adopted effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal we adopted sfas r in fiscal year on october  using the modified prospective method 
we estimate that expense related to share based payments to employees will have an impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately in the first quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policy for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user  however  the application of these policies does not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value 
we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary 
while a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations  an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  when appropriate  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
long lived assets we review property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property  plant  and equipment during the past three fiscal years  except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions  deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  in certain instances  assets may not be impaired but their 
table of contents estimated useful lives may have decreased 
in these situations  we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 
goodwill in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows 
because we have one reporting segment under sfas  we utilize the entity wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists 
these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly 
at october   we had gross deferred tax assets of million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
in addition  we have provided for potential liabilities due in various jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
contingencies from time to time  we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for contingencies 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations

forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains or incorporates forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management s beliefs and assumptions 
in addition  other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on our behalf 
words such as expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
we have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading factors that may affect future results that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make 
we do not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect future results our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors  including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity  the risk that our backlog could decline significantly  our ability to hire  retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers  changes in product mix  and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets 
in addition  the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns 
our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance  depending on the mix of future business  that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
long term contracts are not typical for us and reductions  cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
in certain markets where end user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict  some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment  even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all  or even any  of the product 
at any given time  this situation could affect a portion of our backlog 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp fall off of sales and backlog 
further  those orders may be for products that meet the customer s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would  in addition  result in an inventory of unsaleable products  resulting in potential inventory write offs 
as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties  the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 
reductions  cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets 
our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense 
there can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future  that our existing and new products will meet 
table of contents the requirements of these markets  that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets  that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us  or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets 
furthermore  a decline in demand in one or several of our end user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 
also  some of our customers in these markets are less established  which could subject us to increased credit risk 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future 
many other companies offer products that compete with our products 
some have greater financial  manufacturing  technical and marketing resources than we have 
additionally  some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies 
our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors  or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
we rely on third party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry standard wafers and assembly test services  and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 
we rely  and plan to continue to rely  on assembly and test subcontractors and on third party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard submicron processes 
this reliance involves several risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
additionally  we utilize third party wafer fabricators as sole source suppliers  primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company 
these suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications 
we have no written supply agreements with these sole source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders 
if these sole source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us  on the time schedule and of the quality that we require  we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers  which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers 
we may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products  and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and short term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly 
during these periods of rapid increases in demand  our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand 
we  and the semiconductor industry generally  expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to these periods of increased demand 
these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results 
our revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 
we  and the semiconductor industry generally  expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase 
should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
we rely primarily upon know how  rather than on patents  to develop and maintain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse 
table of contents engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests 
other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes  and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products  if such patents are found to be valid 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses  if required  upon commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
moreover  the laws of foreign countries in which we design  manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
we are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 
there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it 
we believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience  innovation and management skill 
there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology  or reverse engineer our products  or that our confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights  including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers 
we have received from time to time  and may receive in the future  claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property  and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement  and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us 
an adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 
if we do not retain our key personnel  our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel  particularly our experienced engineers  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
the competition for these employees is intense 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 
we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas  which could affect the availability of supplies and services 
we  and many companies in the semiconductor industry  rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in california as well as wafer fabrication foundries in taiwan and other sub contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world 
this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry  including temporary loss of capacity  availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport 
any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities  or those of our subcontractors or third party wafer fabrication foundries  as a result of fire  natural disaster  unavailability of electric power or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we are exposed to economic  political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 
during fiscal year  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets 
although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 
potential interest rate increases  particularly in the united states and china  as well as high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products 
we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines 
in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry  we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general  including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism  and the response to them by the united states and its allies 
these risks include air transportation disruptions  expropriation  currency controls  currency exchange rate movement  and additional costs related to tax  tariff and freight rate increases 
our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives 
a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control 
these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us 
we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors 
our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations 
termination of a significant distributor  whether at our initiative or the distributor s initiative  could disrupt our current business 
if we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted 
we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
minute impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing  it is possible that some processes could become unstable 
this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our annual interest income would change by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the fair values of our investment portfolio at october  and october  would change by approximately million and million  respectively  for each basis point increase or decrease in rates 
foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note i in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts 
the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to six months 
the short term nature of these 
table of contents contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at october  and october  currently  our largest foreign currency exposure is against the euro  primarily because our european operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october  and october   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments  primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices
