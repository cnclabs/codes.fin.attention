this process began during the second half of fiscal  when we refocused our primary operating metrics and management incentive measurements to emphasize the need for each of our businesses to achieve acceptable returns on shareholder invested capital 
within each of our businesses  we are taking the strategic actions we consider necessary to achieve our return objective 
the significant highlights of our fiscal progress in each operating segment are described below 
continuing operations tactical vehicle systems we began full rate production under the new multi year fmtv contract with the us army during the fourth quarter of additionally  we have continued to pursue opportunities to supplement this production contract 
during fiscal  we were awarded approximately million in contracts to reset  fmtv s and hemtt vehicles to their full operational standards 
in addition  we received contract awards valued at million for the production of  low signature armored cabs lsac for the fmtv  with deliveries scheduled through august this armored cab was developed for variants of the fmtv with the objective of improving soldier protection 
power products we completed numerous streamlining and cost reduction actions in fiscal  and we continue to evaluate additional opportunities in order to generate acceptable returns on invested capital 
key actions taken during fiscal include the sale of assets and distribution rights of the thermo king and mercury marine mercruiser product lines  the sale of assets of the wheelchair lift manufacturing product line  the sale of certain undeveloped real estate and an idle manufacturing facility  the closure of an under performing branch located in auburn  washington  the sale of certain assets within our rental equipment fleet  and the consolidation of our domestic regions into three geographic territories 
these strategic actions resulted in a reduction in working capital employed by the business of approximately million and the loss of approximately million in annual sales 
these lost revenues have largely been replaced by a higher quality revenue stream as a result of improved economic conditions and focused sales efforts in our primary markets 
as of january   total headcount for this segment has been reduced by personnel or since september  including personnel reductions that occurred during fiscal in addition to the cost reduction actions  this business is placing a significant focus on its sales efforts and has implemented intense sales training throughout the organization 
also  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased a freightliner dealership in el paso  texas for million in order to explore this business for potential future growth opportunities 
engineered products the order backlog for petroleum equipment has continually improved throughout fiscal  increasing to million at january  increasing sales volume  along with improved project execution and cost controls have generated significantly improved results from this business 
in fiscal  we plan to continue our evaluation of the long term earnings potential for the primary components of this segment  including the petroleum equipment and utility equipment product lines 
upon completing this evaluation  we plan to take the strategic actions necessary in this segment to generate consistent acceptable returns  which may include the exit of some or all of the product lines of this segment 
discontinued operations distributed energy solutions this segment packages and markets reciprocating diesel and natural gas engine generator sets 
we announced the exit of the engineering  procurement and construction epc activities of this business during the third quarter of fiscal since that time  we have incurred significant losses in the process of exiting this business related to the completion of remaining construction projects  costs to satisfy customer warranty obligations  valuation adjustments related to the liquidation of inventory  and costs associated with the settlement of customer disputes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reached the point in this wind down effort in which this business segment has substantially completed its construction activities  and therefore meets the requirements of a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of this segment  along with the results of operations  have been reclassified for all periods presented as discontinued operations 
airline products during the second quarter of fiscal  we announced our decision to pursue the sale of our airline products business 
this sale was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as substantially all of the assets of this business were sold for proceeds of million  including a million cash payment  a million senior secured note due in april and the assumption of certain liabilities 
this segment is reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
fiscal vs 
fiscal fiscal sales increased by million from fiscal to  million 
the sales increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in the tactical vehicle systems segment  partially offset by sales declines of million in the engineered products segment 
sales in the power products segment were down by million 
gross profit increased million to million in fiscal from fiscal this increase reflects a gross profit margin improvement to  compared to in fiscal the improved gross profit margin is primarily attributable to the power products segment  which contributed an additional million of gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal the engineered products segment contributed million of increased gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal these improvements included the impact of million of charges recorded in fiscal associated with inventory impairment 
the improvements in these two segments were partially offset by a million decrease in the tactical vehicle systems segment  primarily associated with the transition to the current fmtv production contract in the fourth quarter of fiscal these changes from fiscal to fiscal are described in further detail within the segment information sections below 
selling and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from fiscal selling and administrative expenses in fiscal include the million of charges associated with key management actions  which include million of employee separation costs  million related to reserve requirements associated with self insurance policy changes  million associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in the engineered products segment  and million of legal expenses in the power products segment 
the remainder of the improvement from fiscal is attributable to million of cost savings generated by employee workforce reductions  a million reduction in fringe benefits expense associated with changes made to our employee pension  postretirement and medical benefits plans  and million associated with other cost reductions 
fiscal results include million of asset impairment charges pursuant to analyses prepared in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
within the engineered products and power products segments 
additionally  fiscal includes a one time non cash charge of million to write off previously unamortized prior service costs pension curtailment expense as a result of our decision to freeze the employee benefits earned under our defined benefit pension plan  defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan and postretirement medical plan effective july  net interest expense decreased by million from fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the scheduled payment of million on long term borrowings that was made in may the effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was unusually high due to the impact of relatively large federal tax credits  which increase the effective tax rate in periods of pre tax losses  but decrease the effective tax rate in periods of pre tax earnings 
net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal were million  or per diluted share 
this represented a million improvement from the million net loss  or per diluted share  in fiscal business segments reported as discontinued operations include the airline products division  which was sold in january  the distributed energy solutions business  which the company is reporting as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and other businesses sold in prior years 
the loss from discontinued operations was million  after tax  in fiscal  compared to million  after tax  in fiscal the airline products business generated a million after tax loss in fiscal  down from an million loss in fiscal additionally  we recorded a million gain  net of tax  on the sale of the airline products business in fiscal the distributed energy solutions business generated a million after tax loss in fiscal compared to a million loss in fiscal the losses incurred in fiscal and fiscal are primarily associated with asset valuation adjustments and costs incurred to liquidate remaining inventory  complete construction projects and satisfy remaining customer warranty and other contractual obligations pursuant to our decision to exit the epc activities 
as we have continued to perform our remaining obligations associated with the distributed energy solutions segment  we have encountered a number of customer notices or disputes  including certain matters discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
in these and other cases  we are making every reasonable effort to minimize the cost of further claims by working with our customers and supply partners to address customer issues related to equipment performance and contract issues 
although we have completed the majority of epc obligations that were entered into prior to our decision to exit the business  a number of epc projects are not expected to be completed until some time in fiscal while we have recognized all known estimated losses on these uncompleted contracts  warranty obligations and other customer disputes  continued uncertainty remains related to the execution of the remaining obligations 
these uncertainties may result in additional unexpected losses until all remaining obligations are completed 
additionally  we expect to continue to recognize some general and administrative costs required to support the remaining warranty and contract performance aspects of this business 
we are also obligated to execute under certain fixed price operation and or maintenance contracts related to previously completed epc projects  which have terms potentially extending up to six years 
discontinued operations also include the remaining costs associated with retained contracts  warranty and legal claims and obligations associated with our blowout preventer and controls  valve and drilling riser business  which was sold during fiscal this business generated an million after tax loss in fiscal  compared to a million loss in fiscal the increased loss in this business in fiscal related to the settlement of two customer disputes  including the lawsuit filed by diamond offshore drilling  inc in may including discontinued operations  the net earnings in fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to a million net loss  or per diluted share  in fiscal tactical vehicle systems the tactical vehicle systems segment  which manufactures tactical vehicles for the us army and provides sustaining design engineering  service and support  recorded sales of million in fiscal  a million increase from fiscal the increase in sales is primarily the result of increased unit deliveries  as follows year ended january  trucks   trailers lsac the lsac deliveries in fiscal generated million of additional sales and increases in truck and trailer deliveries generated an additional million of sales 
also  parts and service sales increased by million  primarily due to the reset contracts mentioned above  as well as the continued demand on replacement parts for vehicles deployed in iraq 
operating profit for this segment in fiscal was million operating margin  down from million operating margin in fiscal this decline in operating profit is primarily attributable to the expected decline in operating profits associated with the transition to the new fmtv production contract  combined with million of increased material costs associated with cost increases in steel components  partially offset by the impact of the higher sales volume 
scheduled deliveries during fiscal under the fmtv contract currently include  trucks and  trailers 
the current delivery schedule is subject to change at the request of the customer 
sales volumes under the fmtv contract will be supplemented by the reset contracts and lsac deliveries 
our operating profit margins in this segment in the near term are expected to be approximately half of the range achieved in recent years under the prior fmtv contract 
actual future margins of the tactical vehicle systems segment will be dependent upon a number of factors including our ability to achieve operational efficiencies  materials and labor cost controls  the actual quantities and variations of vehicles purchased by the us army under the new contract  future prices for steel and other commodities  the potential for additional contracts  other product introductions  bid and proposal activities and other factors 
the operating margin that this segment will achieve in total may also be impacted by additional sales  if any  to other allied governments and the level of engineering service and spare parts provided 
power products the power products segment sells and rents various industrial equipment  sells components  replacement parts  accessories and other materials supplied by independent manufacturers  and provides in shop and on site repair services for industrial  transportation  marine  construction  power generation and material handling equipment 
sales for the power products segment in fiscal were million  a million decrease from the million recorded in fiscal a breakdown of power products segment sales follows in millions year ended january  equipment sales parts sales service and rental sales the change in sales from fiscal includes approximately million of sales declines attributable to the exit of the thermo king product offering in texas and louisiana  the wheelchair lift manufacturing and mercruiser product offerings  along with the closure of certain under performing branch locations 
additionally  parts sales were million lower in fiscal  largely as a result of changes to our distribution contracts with detroit diesel corporation detroit diesel  as discussed more fully below 
these sales declines were largely offset by higher equipment and service sales in continuing locations  which were largely attributable to more focused sales efforts and general economic improvements in the heavy equipment markets we serve 
effective january  we entered into new contracts with detroit diesel for the distribution and servicing of its diesel engine products 
one set of contracts  which expires in december  is with detroit diesel corporation and covers the on highway products and services 
under the terms of the new on highway agreements  detroit diesel allows its affiliated freightliner  sterling and western star dealers collectively  the fllc dealers to purchase their on highway detroit diesel parts directly from the freightliner parts distribution centers  rather than purchasing them from a detroit diesel distributor  as was previously required 
consequently  our parts sales to fllc dealers have declined in fiscal  compared to fiscal additionally  under the terms of the new contract  we have received direct compensation from detroit diesel totaling million for fiscal related to fllc dealer purchases made directly from the freightliner parts distribution centers 
such direct compensation is continuing in fiscal  but may be discontinued by detroit diesel at any time 
the second set of detroit diesel agreements is with daimlerchrysler off highway holding gmbh  and covers off highway products and services 
this contract expires in december and includes terms similar to the previous distribution agreement 
this segment recorded an operating profit of million in fiscal compared to a million operating loss in fiscal the improvement in operating profit is partially attributable to million of charges recorded in fiscal  including million for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  million associated with the liquidation of slow moving inventory  million of legal defense and settlement costs and million of employee separation costs 
additionally  fiscal benefited from on going cost reduction programs in this segment 
workforce reductions resulted in an million decrease in employee compensation costs and changes in employee benefit programs resulted in an additional million decrease in operating expenses 
this segment also recognized million of gains associated with the sale of assets and businesses  a million improvement in the lifo inventory valuation reserve due to reductions in inventory levels  a million reduction in bad debt expense and the million of direct compensation from detroit diesel mentioned above 
other cost reductions associated with product exits and branch closures  along with improved sales mix account for the remaining million of operating profit improvement 
in fiscal  we intend to continue our strategic review of the various business activities within the power products segment and take the actions appropriate to further improve our return in this segment 
as a result of the many actions taken in the power products segment  we anticipate that this segment will continue to generate positive operating profit and cash flow and improved returns during fiscal however  due to the many uncertainties involved with this business  including the general economic conditions in the markets we serve  we cannot predict with certainty when this segment will consistently achieve our targeted level of financial return 
engineered products the engineered products segment consists of two primary product lines  petroleum equipment and utilities equipment 
the petroleum equipment business manufactures equipment primarily for the well stimulation segment of the oil service industry 
its products include coil tubing systems and acidizing and fracturing systems 
the utilities equipment business manufactures mobile railcar movers  snow blowers  and off road seismic vehicles 
the engineered products segment recorded sales of million in fiscal  a million decrease from the fiscal sales of million 
declines in petroleum equipment sales resulting from the completion of certain large equipment projects accounted for approximately million of sales decline from fiscal this decrease was partially offset by million of increased off road seismic vehicle sales  million of increased railcar mover sales  and other sales increases 
this segment posted an operating profit of million in fiscal  a million improvement from the million operating loss in fiscal this increase in operating profit is partially attributable to million of charges in fiscal  including million associated with liquidation of slow moving inventory  million of costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations  and a million charge for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
this segment also recorded million of improvement in the lifo inventory valuation reserve due to reductions in inventory levels 
the remaining million operating profit improvement is attributable to higher margins on sales  which is due to improving order execution and cost controls  as well as general economic improvements in the markets that we serve 
backlog in this segment increased to million at january  from million at january  as a result of this increased backlog and the favorable economic conditions within the markets that we serve  sales volumes and operating profits are expected to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal beyond fiscal  however  sales are difficult to predict and typically come in large volume orders and require long lead times to complete 
the sales derived from customers in the united states are primarily driven by the capital spending budgets of the oilfield service companies we serve and  to some extent  the internal capacity of some customers to package their own equipment 
although oil and gas prices  drilling permits  work over rig utilization and drilling rig count are indicators of the overall condition of the markets we serve  changes in these indicators do not necessarily directly correlate to our order rate 
we are much more dependent on the timing of large international orders and the capital spending patterns of the individual customer base we serve 
in addition  we encounter significant price competition  especially in the case of international sales  which can significantly impact our success rate in gaining new orders 
corporate corporate expenses consist of costs incurred by the corporate headquarters group and not associated with the operating activities of the other segments 
such costs include the facility related costs of maintaining the corporate office  chief executive  legal  finance  internal audit  investor relations and other similar costs 
in fiscal  total corporate expenses were million  a million decrease from the preceding fiscal year 
this decrease was largely attributable to million of employee separation expenses and million of pension curtailment expense incurred in fiscal this cost decrease was partially offset by million of costs incurred in fiscal associated with the implementation of the internal control reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  and changes in other operating expenses 
in fiscal  we anticipate that corporate expenses will decline from fiscal levels  partially due to anticipated reductions in costs associated with the requirements of sarbanes oxley act  as well as the benefits of continued cost reduction programs 
fiscal vs 
fiscal fiscal sales increased slightly from fiscal to  million from  million 
a sales increase in the engineered products segment in fiscal was offset by sales declines in the power products and tactical vehicle systems segments of and  respectively  compared to fiscal gross profit decreased million to million in fiscal from fiscal this decline reflects a gross profit margin decrease to  compared to in fiscal the decline in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to the power products segment  which generated million of gross profit margin deterioration  combined with the engineered products segment  which contributed million of profit margin deterioration 
the remainder of the variance is primarily due to a change in sales mix between business segments 
fiscal results include million of asset impairment charges pursuant to analyses prepared in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
within the engineered products and power products segments 
these asset impairment charges are described further in the segment data section below 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from fiscal selling and administrative expenses in fiscal include million of significant charges associated with key management actions  which are described in more detail in the segment data below 
the remainder of the change from fiscal is attributable to increases in certain operating expenses  which were partially offset by cost reduction actions 
as mentioned above  the employee benefits earned under our defined benefit pension plan  defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan and postretirement medical plan were frozen effective july  these changes resulted in a one time non cash charge of million to write off previously unamortized prior service costs pension curtailment expense during fiscal net interest expense decreased by million from fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the scheduled payment of million on long term borrowings that was made in may the effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the change in effective tax rate is primarily the result of federal tax credits 
discontinued operations generated an after tax loss of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal this increased loss is primarily attributable to the management decision to exit the epc activities of the distributed energy solutions segment in the third quarter of fiscal this business generated a million loss in fiscal  compared to a million loss in fiscal the airline products business  which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal  generated an after tax loss of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the fiscal loss included million of pre tax charges for the impairment of inventory  while the fiscal results included a pre tax charge of million associated with the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
we disposed of our blowout preventer and controls  valve and drilling riser business in fiscal the retained obligations associated with this business resulted in an after tax loss of million in fiscal  compared to a million loss from operations in fiscal additionally  fiscal included a million charge  net of tax  associated with a financial guarantee for certain gas turbine equipment in argentina 
in fiscal  we also recognized a loss from sale of the blowout preventer and controls  valve and drilling riser business of million  net of tax 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  a charge of million net of tax  or per diluted share  upon adoption of new accounting standards related to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
tactical vehicle systems the tactical vehicle systems segment recorded sales of million in fiscal  down million or from fiscal the segment delivered  trucks and trailers in fiscal  compared to  trucks and trailers in fiscal by comparison  the quantities included a lower proportion of larger vehicles  which have a higher unit sales price 
as a result  fiscal sales of equipment were down to million from fiscal engineering and service sales were down to million in fiscal from the previous year  primarily due to lower activity associated with a us army project to retrofit existing tactical vehicles with certain product enhancements 
this decline in service sales was partially offset by an increase in parts sales  which approximately doubled to million  primarily attributable to the increased replacement needs for vehicles deployed in iraq 
operating profit for this segment in fiscal was million operating margin  down from million operating margin in fiscal this slight decline in operating profit is primarily attributable to the lower sales volume in fiscal selling and administrative expenses were relatively flat from fiscal to fiscal as a decrease in costs associated with bid and proposal activities was offset by increased costs in some expense categories 
power products sales for the power products segment in fiscal were million  a million decrease from the million recorded in fiscal this decline is largely attributable to lower equipment sales  as a reduction in marine application projects resulted in approximately million decline in sales 
additionally we experienced approximately million in lower equipment sales due to lower capital spending from customers in other markets we serve  including oil and gas exploration and commercial trucking 
a breakdown of power products segment sales follows year ended january  in millions equipment sales parts sales service and rental sales operating loss for this segment in fiscal was million  a million deterioration from the million operating loss posted in fiscal the lower sales volume contributed million to the operating loss  partially due to the relatively fixed cost structure in the service and rental departments 
additionally  increased employee compensation and benefits contributed approximately million to the operating loss 
we also incurred increased legal expenses related to defense and settlement of certain legal claims against the company totaling million  million of employee separation costs related to headcount reductions  and higher bad debt expense of million  partially due to economic weakness in the markets that we serve 
lower margin product sales  partially due to efforts to dispose of slow moving inventory  along with higher ongoing operating expenses contributed an additional million to the fiscal loss 
due to the deteriorating performance of the power products segment at the time  our management took numerous actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal to improve the operating results of this segment 
these actions resulted in additional charges to the segment  which further deteriorated the fiscal operating loss 
most notably  the segment incurred a million charge for the disposal and impairment of inventory related to the implementation of programs to liquidate slow moving inventory in the current market environment in order to reduce working capital investment in the business 
additionally  the decision to exit the thermo king product line prompted a test of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of this analysis  we impaired the goodwill by million 
engineered products the engineered products segment recorded sales of million in fiscal  a million increase from the fiscal sales of million 
the petroleum equipment business generated approximately million of this sales increase through higher equipment sales both domestically and internationally  as capital spending increased somewhat in the oil services industry from fiscal additionally  this segment generated higher sales in utility equipment products of million primarily attributable to a three year production contract awarded in december to provide off road seismic vehicles for input output  inc production under this contract began during the second quarter of fiscal this segment posted an operating loss of million in fiscal  a million change from the million operating loss in fiscal despite the increased sales volume  which would have generated a million improvement to operating profit at prior year operating margins  the petroleum equipment sales in fiscal had a much larger mix of lower margin sales to international customers 
as a result of this change in customer mix  the increased petroleum equipment volume contributed only million of incremental operating profit to this segment 
we completed the consolidation of our manufacturing operations which included relocating the houston railcar mover and snow blower manufacturing operations into an existing engineered products manufacturing facility in houston  texas 
the engineered products segment incurred million of costs associated with this consolidation project  all in fiscal subsequent to executing this consolidation project  our decision to exit the distributed energy solutions segment  which shares the same manufacturing facility  created a change of events that required a test of recoverability of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of this analysis  we impaired the long lived assets of our manufacturing operations by million  reducing their carrying value to fair market value 
the engineered products segment incurred million of this long lived asset impairment charge  and the distributed energy solutions segment incurred the remaining million 
additionally  the segment recorded a million charge to write down specific inventory in conjunction with management s efforts to liquidate certain types of inventory in the current market environment to reduce working capital invested in the business 
further  higher operating expenses partially due to under utilization of the expanded manufacturing facility and other cost increases contributed approximately million to the operating loss 
corporate in fiscal  total corporate expenses were million  a million increase over the preceding fiscal year 
this increase was largely attributable to million of employee separation expenses and million of pension curtailment expense 
in addition to the elimination of several corporate positions  the employee separation expenses were largely associated with the resignation of our president and chief executive officer in september  including a million cash payment in exchange for the cancellation of stock options held by him 
as a result of our decision to freeze the benefits earned under our defined benefit pension plan  our defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan and our postretirement medical plan effective july   we recorded a one time non cash charge of million to write off previously unamortized prior service costs pension curtailment expense  which was required under accounting rules to reflect the plan changes 
corporate expenses were further increased in fiscal by the impact of a change in our general liability insurance coverage  which resulted in a million charge to increase our accrual for estimated self insurance costs 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower corporate spending and the impact of corporate staff reductions 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations 
we believe that these sources will provide sufficient capital to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditure needs  foreseeable acquisition activity  dividends and other financial commitments 
in january  we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in january no borrowings have been made under this facility  which in effect replaced a million revolving credit facility that expired in january the revolving credit facility has a million sub facility which may be used for letters of credit 
approximately million in letters of credit under the revolving credit facility were outstanding at january  and million was available for borrowing 
this revolving credit facility was issued pursuant to agreements containing covenants that restrict indebtedness  guarantees  sales of assets and other items  and require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio 
based on our financial condition as of january   the restrictions imposed by the company s revolving credit facility do not currently restrict our ability to meet our obligations or to declare and pay dividends at historical levels 
we have million in unsecured senior notes outstanding  which bear interest at a rate of and are due and payable in may additionally  million of such unsecured senior notes were paid when due in may the senior notes agreement limits sales of assets and other items and contains a maximum debt to total capitalization covenant 
based on our financial condition as of january   the restrictions imposed by our senior notes do not currently restrict our ability to meet our obligations or to declare and pay dividends at historical levels 
for additional information related to the revolving credit facility and senior notes  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
to facilitate the purchase of new and used inventory for our freightliner truck dealership in the power products segment  we entered into a floor plan financing agreement with a commercial bank during fiscal the secured facility  which matures in december  allows for borrowings up to million of which million was outstanding at january  advances under this facility bear interest at the prime rate 
in addition  our international subsidiaries had foreign currency bank notes payable totaling million and million at january  and  respectively 
such notes payable consist of renewable  secured loans for the purpose of financing our south american operations 
these loans are denominated in local currency colombian pesos and venezuelan bolivars and are secured by letters of credit issued by us and principally bear market based variable rates of interest 
we use foreign denominated debt to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our south america operations 
in the event that any acquisition of additional operations  growth in existing operations  settlements of lawsuits or disputes  changes in inventory levels  accounts receivable  tax payments or other working capital items create a permanent need for working capital or capital expenditures in excess of the existing cash and cash equivalents and committed lines of credit  we may seek additional capital financing in the form of new debt or equity instruments

fiscal net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable  to a million increase in net earnings from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items  along with a million improvement in net operating assets and liabilities 
this increase was partially offset by a million change in cash flows from discontinued operations  primarily resulting from a million  net payment associated with the settlement of the diamond offshore drilling litigation  along with operating losses in the discontinued businesses 
we received million of insurance proceeds related to the diamond offshore drilling litigation during fiscal  which partially offset the cash payment associated with this settlement 
net cash from investing activities improved to million of cash provided in fiscal from million of cash used in fiscal this improvement is primarily attributable to million of proceeds from the sale of the airline products business and the exit of several power products distributor agreements in fiscal  along with million of proceeds from the disposal of the power products rental fleet and other company assets during fiscal additionally  reduced capital spending resulted in a million decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal  compared to fiscal net cash used in financing activities decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the scheduled repayment of million in senior notes in may fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal  working capital decreased by million to million 
this decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to the million provision for excess and obsolete inventory including million in discontinued operations  along with million of accrued losses on uncompleted contracts recorded in discontinued operations during the second half of fiscal net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to a change in accounts receivable  including a million reduction in accounts receivable in the power products segment in fiscal combined with a million increase in accounts receivable in the engineered products segment in fiscal  related to the timing of large project execution 
net cash provided by discontinued operations improved by million to a million cash inflow in fiscal  due largely to reductions in working capital in discontinued businesses during fiscal net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is the result of a million cash inflow during fiscal primarily related to the sale of a discontinued operation  coupled with a million outflow during fiscal for short term investments with original maturities in excess of days 
capital expenditures increased million to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of million of capital additions at the engineered products manufacturing facility as part of our manufacturing consolidation effort 
net cash used in financing activities increased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the repayment of million in senior notes  which were due and paid on may  contractual obligations and commercial commitments we occasionally enter into certain financing arrangements in the ordinary course of business  including non cancelable operating leases  letters of credit and debt guarantees 
we enter into operating leases for some of our facility and equipment needs 
such lease arrangements enable us to conserve cash by paying monthly lease rental fees for the applicable assets rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease period  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease prior to the end of its term  we are typically obligated to pay the remaining lease payments over the term of the lease  and in certain cases may be allowed to sublet the asset to another party 
we are occasionally required to issue performance indemnities or to post letters of credit  generally issued by a bank  to collateralize certain insurance programs  to secure credit facilities or to ensure performance under contracts 
a letter of credit commits the issuer to remit specified amounts to the holder  if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to meet our obligations under the letter of credit 
if this were to occur  we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer for any payments the issuer was required to remit to the holder of the letter of credit 
generally  a letter of credit is released when we have satisfied the obligations that the letter of credit is securing 
our contractual obligations at january   excluding interest on debt balances  are summarized as follows in thousands less than one year fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total long term debt obligations  notes payable   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations     in addition  our other commercial commitments expire as follows in thousands less than one year fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total letters of credit   contingent performance indemnities  in addition to the above  we have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that covered substantially all of our full time employees and a defined benefit postretirement medical plan 
effective july   we froze the benefits earned under these plans  with the exception of a small transition group 
we anticipate contributing approximately million during fiscal under the defined benefit pension plans and approximately million under the postretirement medical plan 
employee defined benefit plans we have a frozen noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that covered substantially all of our full time employees and an unfunded defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan covering certain highly compensated employees 
the pension benefits are based on years of service  limited to years  and the employee s highest consecutive five year average compensation out of the last years of employment 
we fund pension costs in conformity with the funding requirements of applicable government regulations 
in an effort to reduce ongoing operating costs and improve our competitive position  we froze the benefits earned under such plans effective july   with the exception of a small transition group 
these plan changes are expected to significantly reduce our future costs and required contributions under these plans 
since our accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of our plan assets  we were required to reflect on our balance sheet a minimum pension liability for the difference totaling million as of january   million of which was recorded in fiscal minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase in pension liability with an offsetting charge to shareholders equity net of income tax through other comprehensive income rather than net income 
the calculations of liability and expense associated with our pension plans are dependent on key assumptions  including the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the assumed rate of compensation increases 
for purposes of calculating our benefit obligations as of january   we lowered the assumed discount rate used for this calculation from at january  to  based on the change in the moody s aa long term corporate bond yield from january  to january  we assumed our expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be  which is consistent with fiscal in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of risk premiums associated with other asset classes and the expectations of future returns over a year time horizon on each asset class  based on the views of leading financial advisors and economists 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the plan s target asset allocation 
we also gave consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the fund and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment using capital market projections  an estimated long term asset allocation strategy based on the plan s statement of investment policy  objectives and guidelines and an estimate of annual administrative  investment management and trading expenses 
consistent with the prior year  we used in fiscal as the assumed rate of compensation increase for our employee population  based on historical trends and the expectation that long term rates of compensation increase should approximate growth in overall gross domestic product 
we continuously review all assumptions used in the pension calculations and may revise them in the future 
if we were to decrease the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption by basis points  the pension expense we recognized in fiscal would have increased by million 
if we were to decrease the discount rate by basis points  the pension expense we recognized in fiscal would have increased by approximately million 
during fiscal  and we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of expense associated with our defined benefit pension plans 
during those same three years  we contributed million  million and million of funding  respectively  to our pension plans 
based on the best available information we have at this time  we expect that in fiscal we will contribute approximately million to our defined benefit pension plans and recognize approximately million of pension expense 
these pro forma estimates for fiscal include a discount rate of  an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and a rate of compensation increase 
increases in future pension funding requirements could occur if the actual return on plan assets in future periods does not approximate the long term rate of return assumed by us  and the amount of such increases could be material 
in addition to our defined benefit pension plans  we have a defined benefit postretirement medical plan  which provides for the payment of medical costs of eligible employees and dependents upon retirement 
the plan is currently not funded 
we expect to continue paying postretirement medical costs as covered claims are incurred 
effective july   we decided that postretirement medical benefits will not be provided to future retirees  with the exception of a small transition group 
in addition  plan participants will pay a higher portion of total plan costs in future years 
like the pension plans discussed above  the defined benefit postretirement medical plan is dependent on key assumptions  including the discount rate and future healthcare cost trend rates 
for this actuarial calculation  we used a discount rate of and assumed an annual rate of increase of approximately for pre age covered health care benefits and for post age health care benefits  eventually and gradually decreasing to by and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the healthcare cost trend rate assumption in each future year would impact the postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million and would impact the total service and interest cost by approximately million 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
fasb staff position  issued in may  provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the act  and was adopted by the company in the third quarter of fiscal  resulting in a million decrease to plan expense for fiscal prior to the end of fiscal  the company announced that the defined benefit postretirement medical plan is being amended effective january   to discontinue prescription medication coverage for all participants who are both eligible for prescription drug benefits under medicare and for whom medicare is the primary payor 
this plan change is expected to reduce the plan s net periodic benefit cost beginning in fiscal critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures during the period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional adjustments to reserve items might be required 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical and pervasive accounting policies we use  and the areas most sensitive to material change from external factors 
revenue recognition revenue on equipment and parts sales is recognized when contract terms are met  collectibility is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
cash discounts or other incentives to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
revenue from service agreements is recognized as earned  when services have been rendered 
revenue from rental agreements is recognized over the rental period 
with respect to long term construction contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
the majority of our long term construction contracts are fixed price contracts  and measurement of progress toward completion is based on units of production for the fmtv contracts in the tactical vehicle systems segment  and typically based on direct labor hours for other percentage of completion contracts 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs to complete and profit margins are recognized in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
with respect to cost plus fixed fee contracts  we recognize the fee ratably as the actual costs are incurred  based upon the fee amounts expected to be realized upon completion of the contracts 
bid and proposal costs are expensed as incurred 
we frequently sell equipment together with start up services  which typically involve adding fuel to the engine  starting the equipment for the first time  and observing it to ensure that it is operating properly 
in cases where start up services are required on an equipment sale  the estimated start up costs are accrued when revenue from the equipment sale is recognized 
warranty costs based on historical experience and contract terms  we provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties at the time of sale or  in some cases  when specific warranty problems are identified 
accrued warranty costs are adjusted periodically to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
occasionally  a material warranty issue can arise that is beyond our historical experience 
we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
should actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from our current estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit and credit enhancements to customers and other parties in the normal course of business and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments 
we base such estimates on our historical experience  existing economic conditions and any specific customer collection issues we have identified 
uncollectible accounts receivable are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount less than the outstanding balance or when we determine that the balance will not be collected 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past 
circumstances in some of the industries in which our customers operate may affect their operating performance and cash flows  which in turn might affect our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
as circumstances develop  the financial condition of specific customers changes or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost primarily determined on a last in  first out lifo basis  and market determined on the basis of estimated realizable values  less related customer deposits 
we purchase a considerable amount of our inventory for resale from independent manufacturers pursuant to distribution agreements 
cost represents invoice or production cost for new items and original cost less allowance for condition for used equipment inventory 
production cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
when circumstances dictate  we write inventory down to its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand  technological innovations  market conditions  plans for disposal and the physical condition of products 
if circumstances change  causing us to reduce our estimate of realizable value for specific inventory items or categories  additional provisions to cost of sales may be required 
asset impairment we assess the valuation of components of our property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets whenever events or circumstances dictate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
we base our evaluation on indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such factors indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we determine whether impairment has occurred by analyzing an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows during the estimated useful life of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  measured by the present value of estimated future cash flows or other means  as appropriate under the circumstances 
deferred income tax assets we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
we record a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount we expect to realize 
we consider  as applicable  the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
we will require future taxable income in order to fully realize our net deferred tax assets 
should we determine that we will not likely realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset balance would be charged to the income tax provision in the period such determination is made 
stock based compensation as permitted under sfas no 
 we use the intrinsic value method of accounting to account for our employee stock options and other stock based compensation programs 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of an employee stock option is equal to or greater than the market price of our common stock on the grant date and all other provisions of the award are fixed 
had we used the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation prescribed by sfas no 
 net earnings would have been negatively impacted by million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
insurance we maintain a variety of insurance for our operations that we believe to be customary and reasonable 
although we believe we currently maintain insurance coverage that is adequate for the risks involved  there is always a risk that our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or that our insurance may not cover all losses 
for example  it is possible that an adverse product liability claim could arise in excess of our coverage 
in addition  insurance rates and availability are subject to wide fluctuation  and changes in our coverage and the insurance industry could result in increases in our insurance cost and higher deductibles and retentions 
we are self insured up to certain levels in the form of deductibles and retentions for general liability  vehicle liability  group medical and workers compensation claims 
other than normal business and contractual risks that are not insurable  our risk is commonly insured against and the effect of a loss occurrence is not expected to be significant 
we accrue for estimated self insurance costs and uninsured exposures based on estimated development of claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses accordingly 
although we believe that adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  uninsured claims and exposures  our estimates of these liabilities may change as claims develop  and adjustments to reserves may be required 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we account for our defined benefit pension plan and our defined benefit postretirement medical plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these standards require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
significant assumptions involved in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit expense include the expected return on plan assets  expected healthcare cost trend rates and expected compensation increases  and the discount rate for calculating future liability

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  by providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock options and other stock based employee compensation 
as permitted under sfas no 
 we continue to use the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for our stock based compensation programs 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of an employee stock option is equal to or greater than the market price of our common stock on the grant date and all other provisions of the award are fixed 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
sfas no 
r is effective in the third quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
r will have on our fiscal financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for further discussion 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the statement requires additional disclosures describing the types of plan assets  investment strategy  measurement date  plan obligations  cash flows and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized during interim and annual periods 
the revised disclosure requirements of sfas no 
r have been included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb  chapter  which clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred by us beginning in fiscal we do not believe the implementation of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no

a special deduction is recognized under sfas no 
as it is earned 
the jobs act also introduces a special one time tax deduction of percent of qualifying repatriations of foreign earnings 
fsp no

factors that may affect future results certain of the statements contained in this document  including those made under the captions business  legal proceedings  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of other than statements of historical fact included herein  all statements herein  including in particular  but not limited to  statements regarding potential future products and markets  our future financial position or results of operations  business strategy  other plans and objectives for future operations  relating to trends  expressing our belief  referring to expectations  relating to future margins  relating to expected cost of capital  referring to backlogs as to future product deliveries  relating to long term contracts in progress or using the words should  could  may  and words of similar import and prospective focus  are forward looking statements 
we can give no assurance that any forward looking statement of ours will prove to have been correct and such statements are not guarantees of future performance 
they involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict  and actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted or implied in such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
specific important factors that could cause actual results  performance  or achievements to differ materially from our forward looking statements  and that otherwise may affect our operations  are identified below 
all written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors 
risks of dependence on government and failure to obtain new government contracts because the us government is one of our key customers  decreased government spending or termination of significant government programs could adversely affect our business 
our tactical vehicle systems segment depends largely on us government expenditures 
in recent years  government contracts in such segment have accounted for substantial percentages of our annual revenues and operating income 
fiscal included the completion of the final production year of our second multi year contract with the us army for production of the fmtv 
in november  we began full rate production under a third multi year contract with the us army that provides for continued production of the fmtv through september at an initial contract value of billion  excluding the exercise of any production options 
the funding of the fmtv contract is subject to the inherent uncertainties of congressional appropriations 
as is typical of multi year defense contracts that may be canceled or adjusted by the government  the fmtv contract must be funded annually by the us army and may be terminated at any time for the convenience of the government 
if the fmtv contract is terminated  other than for our default in which event there could be serious adverse consequences and claims made against us  including repayment of amounts billed and received from the us army in excess of incurred costs and accrued profits classified as current liabilities on our balance sheet and other monetary exposures  the contract includes a provision under which we will be reimbursed for certain allowable costs  but not necessarily for all costs incurred 
we have realized and expect to continue to realize lower margins and production levels under the third multi year contract than under the recently completed fmtv contract 
there can be no assurance as to whether future governmental spending will adequately support our business in this area  and substantial decreases in government spending  the loss of the us government as a customer or the cancellation of key significant government programs could materially and adversely affect our operations 
even if government spending in general continues at current levels  we are not assured that we can compete effectively as to the receipt of specific government orders and contract awards or as to the timing thereof 
the us army is the predominant customer of our tactical vehicle systems segment  accounting for practically all of the sales of this segment 
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed that we will continue to have satisfactory performance in our government contracting business 
inherent risks of government contracts government contracts present us with numerous special risks that are inherent in their nature and that could adversely affect our operations 
major contracts for military systems are often fixed price contracts that are performed over extended periods of time and are subject to changes in scope of work and delivery schedules 
pricing negotiations on changes and settlement of claims often extend over prolonged periods of time 
our ultimate profitability on such contracts may depend on the eventual outcome of an equitable settlement of contractual issues with the us government 
furthermore  there are significant risks in projecting actual costs on multi year fixed price government contracts because of unforeseen factors  including price and wage inflation and supply shortages 
while we attempt to negotiate supply contracts with key suppliers that are synchronized with our long term fixed price obligations  we are not able to do that with a precision that eliminates risks that our actual costs of necessary items will not exceed the costs taken into account in the original contract pricing 
further  as to some suppliers and some items we do not have contracts that are synchronized at all with our long term fixed price obligations 
as to such items  which include raw materials such as steel  as to which there have been recent substantial price increases  we are at continuous risk that we will have cost increases that were not taken into account in our contract pricing 
our government contract operations are subject to us government investigations of business practices and cost classifications from which legal or administrative proceedings can result 
based on government procurement regulations  under certain circumstances a contractor can be fined  as well as suspended or debarred from government contracting 
in that event  we would also be prohibited from selling equipment or services to customers that depend on loans or financial commitments from the export import bank  overseas private investment corporation and similar government agencies during a suspension or debarment 
in such events we might otherwise not be able to receive the benefits of federal assistance payments during a suspension or debarment 
we have been advised that the us customs service and the department of justice have conducted an investigation of potential violations by us of laws relating to the export of controlled military vehicles  weapons mounting systems and firearms 
such investigation could result in the filing of civil or administrative sanctions against us and or individual employees and could result in a suspension or debarment 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed our reasonable management of risks inherent in our government contracting business  and that we will not experience a materially adverse outcome in any us government investigations 
risks of supply interruptions to tactical vehicle systems segment the fmtv incorporates engines  transmissions  axles and a number of other components that are specified by the us army and are available only from the source or sources selected by the us army 
identifying additional or replacement suppliers approved by the us army for any of the numerous components used in the fmtv may not be accomplished quickly or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition to suppliers specified by the us army  we use other suppliers for certain components of the fmtv  some of which are small businesses that are not well capitalized 
in the event we were unable to mitigate the impact or find an alternate supplier in a timely manner  significant interruption in the supply of any of these components  for any reason  including insolvency of a supplier  work stoppages at suppliers and transportation interruptions  could involve significant additional costs and result in delays in production and product deliveries and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the tactical vehicle systems segment 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed that we will not experience significant supply interruptions in the tactical vehicle systems segment 
risks associated with distributed energy solutions segment in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced our plans to exit the turnkey engineering  procurement  and construction activities of the distributed energy solutions segment 
since that time  we have incurred significant losses in the process of exiting this business related to the completion of remaining construction projects  costs to satisfy customer warranty obligations  valuation adjustments related to the liquidation of inventory and costs associated with the settlement of customer disputes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reached the point in this wind down effort in which we are substantially complete with our construction activities  and as a result  the identified assets  liabilities and results of operations for that segment have been reported as discontinued operations 
we continue to have substantial risk with respect to the performance on such contracts  including warranty  product performance and other contractual obligations  as well as certain claims and litigation that have arisen against us with respect to contracts entered into in past years 
while we have recognized all known estimated losses on these uncompleted contracts  warranty obligations and other customer disputes  continued uncertainty remains related to the execution of the remaining obligations 
these uncertainties may result in additional unexpected losses until all contractual issues are resolved and remaining obligations are completed 
additionally  we expect to continue to recognize some general and administrative costs required to support the remaining warranty and contract performance aspects of this business 
we are also obligated to execute under certain fixed price operation and or maintenance contracts related to previously completed epc projects  which have terms potentially extending up to six years 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will be able to manage this circumstance in an overall satisfactory manner  having already taken significant charges with respect to these matters in fiscal and risks of fixed price contracts many of our equipment sales contracts are fixed price contracts as to which the original price may be set at any early stage of the process 
the terms of these contracts require us to guarantee the price of products and services we provide and to assume the risk that the costs to provide such products and services will be greater than anticipated 
the profitability of these contracts is therefore dependent on the ability to reasonably predict the costs associated with performing the contracts 
these costs may be affected by a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
for example  us manufacturers and distributors of steel products  which are used in many of our products  have in recent years experienced difficulties with the pricing and availability of steel 
the volatility of steel prices and increase in steel demand worldwide is expected to negatively affect our expected costs under certain of our fixed price contracts in the near future 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price contract was based  could adversely affect our profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in recent periods  as a result of incurring greater costs than were taken into account in original contract pricing  we have incurred significant losses on certain epc projects in the distributed energy solutions segment 
we may experience similar situations in the future in that segment or in other segments 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed that fixed price contracts will have no further material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks as to rising steel prices while noted above generally in connection with other risk factors  we specifically note that during and  manufacturers and distributors of steel  which is used in many of our products  have experienced sharply increased prices and limited availability of steel and component parts containing steel 
these increased steel prices have had and are expected to continue to have a negative impact on our margins in the near future  particularly on fixed price contracts and other contracts for which we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers 
if these steel price conditions continue  and if we are unable to raise our prices to keep pace with the material cost increases  our sales trends  operating margins and results of operations could be adversely impacted in future periods 
risks as to cost controls as a manufacturing and service company operating within tight margins  with substantial facilities and inventories and a large workforce  our operations have been  and can be  adversely affected by our inability to control costs and to accurately estimate and plan our costs 
we continuously endeavor to implement cost identification  estimation and savings measures in our operations 
our forward looking statements assume that we will be able to contain our costs and expense increases at reasonable levels consistent with expected revenues 
risks of general economic conditions our commercial operations are cyclical and dependent for success on the general economic well being of the united states and certain international markets 
a general economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 
in and  there was a marked period of economic slowdown  and although economic activity increased in and  general economic conditions remain uncertain  particularly in light of the war in iraq  other international tensions and related factors 
if the us or world economies decline or fail to further recover  the demand for  and price of  our products and services could be adversely affected  thus adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
further  other general market conditions such as increased inflation and higher interest rates could also adversely impact our results of operations 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed that general market conditions will not worsen in fiscal and that we are not entering a down cycle in our markets or a period of significantly increasing inflation and interest rates 
risks of oil and gas industry economic conditions our engineered products segment  as well as certain aspects of our power products segment  are closely tied to the oil and gas industry in general and  in particular  to capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and oilfield service and manufacturing companies 
capital expenditures by oil and gas companies have tended in the past to follow trends in the price of oil and natural gas  which have fluctuated widely in recent years  although they are generally at all time highs at present 
a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and oilfield service and manufacturing companies  as we have experienced in some recent years  will likely lead to a drop in demand for products and services in our engineered products segment as well as in our power products segment 
any such drop will have an adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and cash flow during the affected period  as it did during fiscal  and to a lesser extent  fiscal the oil and gas industry has rebounded from low levels in recent years  however  we cannot assure you that the industry will continue to rebound or stabilize  that industry capital spending will be robust in future periods or that industry capital spending will increase proportionally with price increases for oil and gas 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that economic conditions and capital spending in such industry will stabilize at least at present levels or improve 
risks as to distributorships our power products and engineered products segments are  in particular  dependent upon a number of distribution agreements with third party manufacturers 
all of our distribution agreements either have expiration dates or are terminable upon certain notifications 
even those with expiration dates are also terminable based on other factors  including changes in our control or in our principal management 
while our principal distribution agreements have been renewed on a regular basis in the past  there can be no assurance that any particular distribution agreement will be renewed in the future on favorable terms or at all  or that  on the whole  our principal distribution agreements will continue to be renewed 
the termination of key distribution agreements  or a failure to renew on favorable terms or at all  could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our principal distribution agreements will not be terminated and or will be renewed as they come up for renewal 
in addition  we have relatively new distributorship arrangements with affiliates of daimlerchrysler that went into effect in january we are at risk under such contracts as to whether our operational results will be materially less satisfactory than in past arrangements with a daimlerchrysler affiliate 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our operational results will be mildly impacted by the new daimlerchrysler arrangements 
risks as to licenses our power products and engineered products segments are dependent upon and subject to certain texas state motor vehicle licensing requirements 
generally  such licenses are renewed annually 
as a result of discussions with the motor vehicle division of the texas department of transportation as to issues that have been raised concerning licenses necessary for the sale  distribution  installation and warranty repair of certain large engines and transmissions  we have agreed with the motor vehicle division to restructure certain of our businesses so that the parent company will no longer be a dealer or a distributor and so that none of our subsidiaries will be both dealers and distributors 
although no enforcement action is currently pending against us in such situation  our licenses have not been renewed pending the resolution of our implementation of the agreement as to the licensing issues that have been raised 
while these licenses have historically been renewed on a regular basis  there can be no assurance that any particular license will be renewed in the future 
the termination of  or failure to renew  key licenses could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our principal licenses will not be terminated and or will be renewed as they come up for renewal and that we will resolve satisfactorily the texas licensing matters 
risk of competition our international and domestic competitors may use their resources and product and service offerings to increase competition  both in terms of pricing and product and service offerings  thereby reducing our market shares and or sales and profitability 
some of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater marketing  financial and technical resources than we have  and these resources might be used in effective competition with us 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will continue to be a reasonably effective competitor in our markets 
risks relating to technology our business will suffer if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological change and product development 
our success will depend on our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry requirements and to respond to technological developments on a timely basis  either internally or through strategic alliances 
we will likely be constantly threatened by current competitors or new market entrants who may develop new technologies or products or establish new standards that could render our products less marketable or obsolete 
thus  we can offer no assurances that we will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  products or product enhancements that respond to our competition  to technological developments  to changing industry standards and to marketplace acceptability 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we can reasonably keep pace with our competitors in technology changes and product development 
risks as to terrorist attacks on the us and their impact on the us economy since the terrorist attacks on the united states in september  the threat of future terrorist incidents may continue to adversely affect our business and the us economy in ways that we cannot identify 
however  threats of future terrorist attacks may adversely affect the demand for our products and services generally in addition to their specific impact on our segments that serve the oil and gas industries 
our forward looking statements at present assume no further material impacts of such circumstances on the us economy or further deterioration on our affected businesses 
risks relating to personnel labor shortages and our inability to recruit and retain key employees and workers could limit our operations and increase our labor costs and  in turn  adversely affect our results of operations 
our manufacturing and service operations are substantially dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain key managers and qualified machinists  mechanics  factory workers and other laborers 
a strong labor market can adversely impact us by limiting our manufacturing capacity or resulting in significantly increased wages and other benefits to attract additional key employees and workers 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will continue to be able to recruit and retain necessary personnel at overall costs that are comparable with our ability to produce revenues 
risks of claims and litigation outcomes of pending litigation and governmental proceedings  as well as future unexpected litigation and legal disputes could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
if we experience materially adverse outcomes or other unexpected results in our existing litigation and government proceedings  which in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  the accuracy of our forward looking statements would be affected 
similarly  if we experience in the future new  unexpected litigation or adverse results from new  unexpected litigation  there could also be a material adverse effect on our results  again affecting the accuracy of our forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements assume that there will be no materially adverse unexpected outcomes or results that we have not already adequately provided for 
risks of product defects our customers often require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability 
because many of our products are complex and often use state of the art components  processes  and techniques  undetected errors and design flaws may occur 
product defects result in higher product service  warranty and replacement costs and may cause damage to our customer relationships and industry reputation  all of which may negatively impact our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will not in the future incur material difficulties with respect to product defects and warranty claims 
risks as to foreign sales and global trade matters foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the us  including the risk of war  terrorist activities  civil disturbances  embargoes  and government activities  all of which may disrupt markets 
foreign sales are also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws  including tariff regulations and import and export restrictions 
sales in certain foreign countries require prior us government approval in the form of an export license 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulties in connection with future foreign sales 
moreover  changes in global trade policies in our markets could impact our sales in these markets 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that there will be no material changes in global trade policies  such as embargoes  new and large tariffs or other tax assessments and the like or other new and material restrictions on trade that apply in particular to our businesses 
risks as to acquisitions and restructuring activities our success is dependent upon the integration of newly acquired businesses with our existing businesses 
our success is also dependent upon executing our restructuring plans in such a manner that we extricate value from facility closures and product offering and business exits  and that we structure continuing business activities in an efficient and tactical manner 
this process involves some amount of realignment and reintegration of business activities and may result in changes to our segment reporting 
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate success of our integration and realignment efforts 
our forward looking statements assume the successful integration of acquired businesses and realigned business activities and their future contribution to our operations 
risks as to currency fluctuations a material change in currency exchange rates in our markets could affect our future results as well as affect the carrying values of certain of our assets 
world currencies have been subject to much volatility in recent years 
the us dollar has continued to weaken somewhat against other key currencies particularly the euro and the japanese yen in recent periods 
while a weakened us dollar is not necessarily adverse to our business in general  it could be generally adverse for the us economy in a number of ways  including putting upward pressure on interest rates 
our forward looking statements assume no material impact from future changes in currency exchange rates 
risks as to environmental and safety matters our operations and products  and the use thereof  are regulated under a number of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration in the manufacturing of our products and in their servicing and distribution  as we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations and as we may be subject to material financial liability for any investigation and clean up of such hazardous materials 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes 
accordingly  we also may be subject to financial liabilities relating to the investigation and remediation of hazardous materials resulting from the action of previous owners or operators of industrial facilities on those sites 
liability in many instances may be imposed on us regardless of the legality of the original actions relating to hazardous or toxic substances or whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of those substances 
we are also subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to safety and health conditions in our manufacturing facilities and with respect to our products and the use thereof and our service operations 
those laws and regulations may also subject us to material financial penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance  as well as potential business disruption if any portion of any of our facilities is required to be temporarily closed as a result of any violation of those laws and regulations 
any financial liability or business disruption from environmental  health or safety issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our forward looking statements assume no material adverse impact from environmental and safety issues 
credit risks we believe that our allowance for bad debts at january   is adequate in light of our collectibility and write off experience  existing economic conditions and specific customer collection issues we have identified 
we cannot  however  give assurance that additional amounts of uncollectible receivables and bad debt write offs will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
we have in the past incurred write offs in our accounts receivable due to customer credit problems 
we have also extended trade credit and credit enhancements to customers from time to time where some risks of nonpayment or late payment exist 
substantial unanticipated collection issues stemming from prolonged periods of economic downturn in one or more industries we serve could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our current reserves and allowances will be sufficient to avoid future material impacts on our results of operations
