item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are the largest electric utility in kansas 
we produce  transmit and sell electricity at retail in kansas and at wholesale in a multi state region in the central united states under the regulation of the kcc and ferc 
our focus during was the continued reduction of our debt and interest expense  primarily through issuing stock  the sale of our interest in protection one and by refinancing some of our debt at lower interest rates 
in  we reduced our debt by million 
our goals for are to improve our core utility business by improving our credit quality  establishing a successful clean air plan  completing a successful rate review  improving our service quality  making our operations more efficient and continuing our involvement in community affairs 
key factors affecting our business in any given period include the weather  the economic well being of our kansas service territory  performance of our electric generating facilities  conditions in fuel markets and the markets for wholesale electricity and the cost of dealing with public policy initiatives 
as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes  which contain our operating results 
critical accounting estimates we base our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management 
the policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or susceptibility of matters to change 
pension benefit plans we calculate our pension benefit and post retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
in accounting for our retirement plans and other post retirement benefits  we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the reported costs of our pension benefit plans  which include our portion of wcnoc s costs  are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets  contributions to the plan  discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on future costs  which may be reflected as an increase or decrease in net income in the current and future periods  or on the amount of related liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets or may also require cash contributions 

table of contents the following table shows the annual impact of a decrease in our pension plan discount rate and rate of return on plan assets 
if the discount rate increased by  the impact would be a similar amount in the opposite direction 
change in assumption annual increase in projected benefit obligation annual increase in pension liability annual increase in projected pension expense in thousands discount rate decrease    rate of return on plan assets decrease  the following table shows the annual impact of a decrease in our post retirement plan discount rate and rate of return on plan assets 
if the discount rate increased by  the impact would be a similar amount in the opposite direction 
change in assumption annual increase in projected benefit obligation annual increase in post retirement liability annual increase in projected post retirement expense in thousands discount rate decrease  rate of return on plan assets decrease revenue recognition energy sales we recognize revenues from retail energy sales upon delivery to the customer and include an estimate for energy delivered but unbilled 
our estimate of revenue attributable to this unbilled portion is based on the total energy available for sale measured against billed sales 
at december   we had estimated unbilled revenue of million 
we account for energy marketing derivative contracts under the mark to market method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize changes in the portfolio value as gains or losses in the period of change 
unless related to fuel  we include the net mark to market change in sales on our consolidated statements of income loss 
we record the resulting unrealized gains and losses as energy marketing long term or short term assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as appropriate 
we use quoted market prices to value our energy marketing derivative contracts when such data are available 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  we use alternative approaches  such as model pricing 
prices used to value these transactions reflect our best estimate of fair values of our trading positions 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could affect our consolidated financial results 

table of contents the tables below show fair value of energy marketing contracts outstanding for the year ended december   their sources and maturity periods 
fair value of contracts in thousands net fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period that were realized or otherwise settled during the period changes in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning and end of the period fair value of new contracts entered into during the period fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period the sources of the fair values of the financial instruments related to these contracts are summarized in the following table

income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
we recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties 
we record deferred tax assets for capital loss  operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when there are not sufficient sources of future capital gain income or taxable income to realize the benefit of the capital loss  operating loss or tax credit carryforwards  we reduce the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
we recognize a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we report the effect of a change in the valuation allowance in the current period tax expense 
operating results we evaluate operating results based on basic earnings loss per share 
we have various classifications of sales  defined as follows retail sales of energy made to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
other retail sales of energy for lighting public streets and highways  net of revenues reserved for rebates 
tariff based wholesale includes the sales of electricity to electric cooperatives  municipalities and other electric utilities  the rate for which is generally based on cost 
table of contents as prescribed by ferc tariffs  and changes in valuations of contracts that have yet to settle 
market based wholesale includes sales of electricity to other wholesale customers  the rate for which is based on prevailing market prices as allowed by our ferc approved market based tariff  and changes in valuations of contracts that have yet to settle 
energy marketing includes market based energy transactions unrelated to our generation or the needs of our regulated customers  financially settled products and physical transactions sourced outside our control area  and changes in valuations for contracts that have yet to settle that may not be recorded either in cost of fuel or tariff or market based wholesale revenues 
transmission reflects transmission revenues received  including those based on a tariff with the spp 
other miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others 
regulated electric utility sales are significantly impacted by such things as rate regulation  customer conservation efforts  wholesale demand  the overall economy of our service area  the weather and competitive forces 
our wholesale sales are impacted by  among other factors  demand  cost of fuel and purchased power  price volatility and available generation capacity

the following table reflects changes in electric sales volumes  as measured by thousands of megawatt hours mwh of electricity  for the two years ended december  and no sales volumes are shown for energy marketing  transmission or other 
energy marketing activities are unrelated to electricity we generate 
change change thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial other retail total retail tariff based wholesale market based wholesale total our retail customers used less energy and our sales decreased because of cooler weather during the summer 
when measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was cooler than during and below the year average 
we measure cooling degree days at weather stations we believe to be generally reflective of conditions in our service territory 
the accrual for rebates to be paid to customers in and pursuant to the 
table of contents july  kcc order also reduced revenues from retail sales 
during  we accrued million as compared to million accrued during market based wholesale sales increased due primarily to increased sales volumes and an approximate increase in the average price per mwh 
as a result of the milder weather  we had additional energy production available for sale at certain times during the year that was not needed to serve our retail and tariff based wholesale customers 
increased sales volumes accounted for approximately million of the increased market based wholesale sales and higher average market prices accounted for approximately million of the increase 
energy marketing sales declined because we had less favorable changes in as compared to the favorable changes in in the settlement and the fair value of positions receiving mark to market accounting treatment 
fuel expense increased due primarily to increases in the cost of fossil fuels  although we used approximately less fuel for generation due to the lower demand caused by the cooler weather and due to unplanned outages or reduced operating capability experienced at some of our generating units at various times throughout the average equivalent availability factor for our system was during compared to in the prior year  due largely to the unavailability of some of our coal fired generating units 
as a result of the cooler weather and the reduced availability of our coal fired generating units  we decreased the amount of coal burned  and consequently reduced our total expense for coal 
however  the cost of natural gas and oil that we used at other generating facilities to compensate for the unplanned outages or reduced operating capability  increased our total fuel expense 
purchased power expense increased due primarily to a increase in volumes purchased during as compared to at times  it was more economical to purchase power than to operate our available generating units 
this was due to unplanned outages or reduced operating capability of our coal fired generating units at certain times  and the availability of economically priced power due to cooler weather in our region 
during  we recorded as an offset to operating and maintenance expense a gain of million on the sale of utility assets 
the absence of a similar offset in accounted for of the increase in operating and maintenance expense in the remainder of the increase was caused primarily by increased expenses associated with maintenance at jeffrey energy center  increased planned and unplanned unit maintenance at various other generating units  increased maintenance of the distribution system  an increase in taxes other than income tax and an increase in the transmission costs 
during  increased maintenance of our generating units accounted for of the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
the increase in distribution expenses accounted for of the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
distribution expenses increased due to increased staffing levels and higher costs associated with the termination of portions of the oneok shared services agreement as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  related party transactions oneok shared services agreement 
the change in taxes other than income tax accounted for of the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
an increase in transportation costs accounted for of the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to an increase in legal fees  including amounts we were required to advance for fees incurred by david c 
wittig  our former president  chief executive officer and chairman  and douglas t 
lake  our former executive vice president  chief strategic officer and member of the board  related to the defense of criminal charges against them  and fees associated with the pending shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits 
the total other expense during was due primarily to the loss incurred on the extinguishment of debt 
the total other income during was due primarily to the gain on the sale of our oneok stock and dividends received from oneok in this gain was partially offset by the loss recorded on the extinguishment of debt and the settlement of notes during interest expense decreased in due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates due to refinancing activities as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
income from discontinued operations was million in the results recorded for include the settlement of previously pending issues as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations sale of protection one and protection one europe 
this compares to a loss from discontinued operations of million in

table of contents our retail customers used less energy and our sales declined because of cooler weather as well as the sale of a small portion of our rural distribution territory 
commercial and industrial sales revenues showed slight decreases while sales volumes remained relatively flat compared to the decline in retail sales volumes accounted for approximately million of the decline in retail sales revenues 
the accrual of approximately million to be refunded to customers in and pursuant to a kcc order also contributed to the decline in retail sales revenues 
the increases in energy marketing and wholesale sales revenues more than offset the decline in retail sales revenues 
higher wholesale market prices were the primary cause of improvement in energy marketing and wholesale sales revenues 
the higher wholesale market prices more than offset the decline in wholesale sales volumes 
purchased power expenses increased million during during periods of high energy use in  we purchased more power from other sources than we did during the same periods of because it was more economical to purchase power than to operate our peaking units 
this is also the primary reason our fuel expense decreased 
operating and maintenance expense declined due primarily to the million gain recorded in on the sale of utility assets  which was recorded as an offset to operating expenses 
general maintenance expenses at our generating facilities increased by million  partially offsetting the decline in operating expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased due to the adoption of new depreciation rates on april  selling  general and administrative expenses declined in  reflecting a reduction in numerous incremental administrative expenses incurred in the administrative expenses included a million charge related to a work force reduction  a million charge related to an exchange of restricted share units rsus for common stock and an expense of million for potential liabilities to mr 
wittig and mr 
lake 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses for was partially offset by million in charges related to the special committee and grand jury investigations in as compared to charges of million in related to these investigations 
other income improved significantly in primarily because the mark to market charge to record the fair value of the call option associated with the senior unsecured notes that were putable and callable on august  the putable callable notes was million for compared to a charge of million for the smaller mark to market charge in was the result of the settlement of the call options related to the putable callable notes in august liquidity and capital resources overview we believe we will have sufficient cash to fund future operations  debt maturities  the rebates to customers we are required to make in and  and the payment of dividends from a combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity 
our available sources of funds include cash  westar energy s revolving credit facility  our accounts receivable conduit facility and access to capital markets 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million available under the revolving credit facility and million available under the accounts receivable conduit facility 
uncertainties affecting our ability to meet these requirements include  among others  factors affecting sales described in operating results above  economic conditions  regulatory actions  conditions in the capital markets and compliance with environmental regulations 
at december   our total outstanding long term debt  net of current maturities  was approximately billion compared to a balance of approximately billion at december  at december   our current maturities of long term debt were million compared to million at december  
table of contents capital resources we had million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at december  we consider cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time they are purchased 
at december   we also had million of restricted cash classified as a current asset and million of restricted cash classified as a long term asset  primarily to provide credit security for energy marketing transactions 
the following table details our restricted cash at december  restricted cash current portion restricted cash long term portion in thousands prepaid capacity and transmission agreement cash held in escrow as required by certain letters of credit  surety bonds and various other deposits total the westar energy mortgage and the kge mortgage each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that could be issued by each entity 
additionally  westar energy s revolving credit facility prohibits us from increasing the amount of secured indebtedness outstanding as of march  by more than million 
therefore  we must ensure that we will be able to comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness 
the westar energy mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless westar energy s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest  depreciation and property retirement which as defined  does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries  for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance  are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on  and of the principal amount of  all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
in addition  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
at december   based on an assumed interest rate of  approximately million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage  except in connection with certain refundings 
the kge mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless kge s net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one half times the annual interest charges on  or of the principal amount of  all kge first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
in addition  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
at december   based on an assumed interest rate of  approximately million principal amount of additional kge first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage 
westar energy s revolving credit facility prohibits us from increasing the amount of secured indebtedness outstanding as of march  by more than million 
in june  westar energy issued million of westar energy first mortgage bonds and immediately placed the funds in escrow for retirement of million of westar energy first mortgage bonds  which was completed in july therefore  at december   we could incur a maximum of million of additional secured debt under this provision in the westar energy revolving credit facility 
following westar energy s january  issuance of million of first mortgage bonds  as discussed in debt financings  we can incur a maximum of million of additional secured debt under this provision in westar energy s revolving credit facility 
westar energy sold approximately million shares of its common stock in for net proceeds of million 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased million to million in from million for this increase was primarily attributable to reduced interest of million and reduced tax payments of million 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was mostly attributable to taxes paid in of million compared to an income tax refund received in of million  an increase in maintenance expenditures at our generating facilities in as compared to  and increased legal expenditures in related to investigations and litigation 
cash flows used in from investing activities in general  cash used for investing purposes relates to the growth and improvement of our electric utility business

future cash requirements our business requires significant capital investments 
through  we expect we will need cash mostly for utility construction programs designed to improve facilities providing electric service and for future peaking capacity needs 
in we anticipate additional cash expenditures necessary to purchase and build approximately mw of peaking generation capacity that we anticipate will be needed in we expect to meet these cash needs with internally generated cash flow and borrowing under westar energy s revolving credit facility 
we are required to pay rebates to retail customers of million on may  and million on january  we believe we can fund these rebates with internally generated cash flow and available borrowing capacity under westar energy s revolving credit facility 
if we are required to update emissions controls or take other remedial action as a result of the epa s investigation  the costs could be material 
we may also have to pay fines or penalties or make significant capital or operational expenditures related to the notice of violation we received from the epa in connection with certain projects completed at jeffrey energy center

table of contents other information ice storm on january and   substantially all of our service territory experienced a severe ice storm 
the storm interrupted electric service in a large portion of our service territory and damaged a significant portion of our electric distribution system 
we estimate that we will incur million to million of system restoration costs 
of this amount  we expect million to million to be accounted for as capital expenditures and we expect the balance related to maintenance expenditures to be accounted for as a regulatory asset 
on february   we filed an application for an accounting authority order with the kcc requesting that we be allowed to accumulate and defer for future recovery maintenance costs related to system restoration 
we can provide no assurance that the kcc will approve our application  however  in the past the kcc has approved similar requests 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize as compensation expense the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
the provisions of the statement are effective for financial statements issued for periods that begin after june   which will be our third quarter beginning july  we currently use rsus for stock based awards granted to employees 
in addition  we have eliminated our employee stock purchase plan and all outstanding options have vested 
given the characteristics of our stock based compensation program  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to materially impact our results of operations 
sale of utility assets in august  we sold a portion of our transmission and distribution assets and rights to provide service to approximately  customers in an area of central kansas 
total sales proceeds received were million and we realized a gain of million 
we may enter into similar transactions in the future 
impact of regulatory accounting we currently apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and record regulatory assets and liabilities related to our electric utility operations 
if we determine that we no longer meet the criteria of sfas no 
 we may have a material non cash charge to earnings 
at december   we had recorded regulatory assets currently subject to recovery in future rates of approximately million 
of this amount  million is related to income tax benefits previously passed on to customers 
the remainder of the regulatory assets include asset retirement obligations  system restoration  loss on reacquired debt  refinancing costs on the lacygne lease  deferred employee benefit costs  deferred plant costs and coal contract settlement costs 
we periodically review sfas no 
criteria and believe that our net regulatory assets are probable of future recovery 
asset retirement obligations in january  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires recognition of legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of such assets 
concurrent with the recognition of the liability  the estimated cost of an asset retirement obligation is capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset 
any income effects are offset by regulatory accounting pursuant to sfas no 
legal liability wolf creek on january   we recognized the liability for our share of the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of the present value of the asset retirement obligation we incurred at the time wolf creek was placed into service in on january   we recorded an asset 
table of contents retirement obligation of million 
in addition  we increased our property and equipment balance  net of accumulated depreciation  by million 
we also established a regulatory asset for million  which represents the accretion of the liability since and the increased depreciation expense associated with the increase in plant 
the asset retirement obligation is included on our consolidated balance sheets in other long term liabilities 
costs to retire wolf creek are currently being recovered through rates as provided by the kcc 
non legal liability cost of removal we have recovered amounts in rates to provide for recovery of the probable costs of removing utility plant assets  but which do not represent legal retirement obligations 
at december   westar energy had million in removal costs classified as a regulatory asset and kge had million in removal costs classified as a regulatory liability 
at december   we had million in removal costs classified as a regulatory asset 
the net amount related to non legal retirement costs can fluctuate based on amounts related to removal costs recovered compared to removal costs incurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging activity we use financial and physical instruments to economically hedge the price of a portion of our anticipated fossil fuel needs 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine what the value will be when the agreements are actually settled 
in an effort to mitigate market risk associated with fuel and energy prices  we may use economic hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to price increases 
our future exposure to changes in prices will be dependent on the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any economic hedging arrangements into which we enter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  financial instruments  energy marketing and risk management derivative instruments and hedge accounting hedging activities  for detailed information regarding hedging relationships and an interest rate swap we entered into during the third quarter of market price risks our economic hedging and trading activities involve risks  including commodity price risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
commodity price risk is the risk that changes in commodity prices may impact the price at which we are able to buy and sell electricity and purchase fuels for our generating units 
we believe we will continue to experience volatility in the prices for these commodities 
this volatility may increase or decrease future earnings 
interest rate risk represents the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
in the future  we may use swaps or other financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
credit risk represents the risk of loss resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
we have exposure to credit risk and counterparty default risk with our retail  wholesale and energy marketing activities 
we maintain credit policies intended to reduce overall credit risk 
we employ additional credit risk control mechanisms that we believe are appropriate  such as letters of credit  parental guarantees and master netting agreements with counterparties that allow for offsetting exposures 
results actually achieved from economic hedging and trading activities could vary materially from intended results and could materially affect our consolidated financial results depending on the success of our credit risk management efforts 
commodity price exposure we engage in both financial and physical trading to manage our commodity price risk 
we trade electricity  coal  natural gas and oil 
we use financial instruments  including forward contracts  options and swaps and we trade energy commodity contracts daily 
we may also use economic hedging techniques to manage overall fuel expenditures 
we procure physical product under forward agreements and spot market transactions 

table of contents we are involved in trading activities to reduce risk from market fluctuations  enhance system reliability and increase profits 
net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have open positions  we are exposed to the risk that changing market prices could have a material  adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we manage and measure the market price risk exposure of our trading portfolio using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
the var model is designed to measure the predicted maximum one day loss at a confidence level 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  credit limits and position limits 
we expect to use similar control processes in the use of the var method requires assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level for potential losses and the estimated holding period 
this means that we are also exposed to the risk that we value and mark illiquid prices incorrectly 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a confidence level using a one day holding period 
the calculation includes derivative commodity instruments used for both trading and risk management purposes 
the var amounts for and were as follows 
in thousands high low average we have considered a number of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our energy portfolio 
these risks include credit risks associated with the financial condition of counterparties  product location basis differentials and other risks 
declines in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our overall exposure to credit risk 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe are effective in managing overall credit risk 
there can be no assurance that the employment of var  or other risk management tools we employ  will eliminate the risk of loss 
we are also exposed to commodity price changes outside of trading activities 
we use derivative contracts for non trading purposes and a mix of various fuel types primarily to reduce exposure relative to the volatility of market and commodity prices 
the wholesale power market is extremely volatile in price and supply 
this volatility impacts our costs of power purchased and our participation in energy trades 
if we were unable to generate an adequate supply of electricity for our customers  we would purchase power in the wholesale market to the extent it is available  subject to possible transmission constraints  and or implement curtailment or interruption procedures as permitted in our tariffs and terms and conditions of service 
the increased expenses or loss of revenues associated with this could be material and adverse to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
from to  we experienced an approximate increase in the average price per mwh of electricity purchased for utility operations 
volatility in the prices for power we purchase could be greater than the average price increase indicates 
additionally  short term  but extreme price volatility could potentially be of greater significance than the change in the average price would indicate  especially during adverse weather or market conditions 
if we were to have a increase in our purchased power price from to  given the amount of power purchased for utility operations during  we would have exposure of approximately million of operating income 
due to the volatility of the power market  we believe past prices are not a good predictor of future prices 
we use various fossil fuel types  including coal  natural gas and oil  to operate our plants 
a significant portion of our coal requirements are purchased under long term contracts 
during  we experienced an approximate increase  or per mmbtu  in our average cost for natural gas purchased for utility operations 
due to the volatility of natural gas prices  we have increasingly operated facilities that have allowed us to use lower cost fuel types as generating unit constraints and environmental restrictions allow  primarily by using oil in our facilities that also burn natural gas 
the average cost for oil purchased for utility operations increased per mmbtu  or approximately  compared to the average cost in the average cost of oil burned was per mmbtu less than the average cost of the natural gas we burned 
if we were to have a increase in our price for natural gas and oil burned from to  based on mmbtus of natural gas and oil burned during  we would have exposure of approximately million of operating income 
due to the volatility of natural gas prices  past prices cannot be used to predict future prices 

table of contents we have of the uranium and conversion services required to operate wolf creek under contract through september we also have of the enrichment services required to operate wolf creek under contract through march we will be exposed to the price risk associated with any components not currently under contract if a counterparty were to fail its contractual obligations 
additional factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and scheduled outages at our facilities that use fossil fuels and the nuclear refueling schedule 
our customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
interest rate exposure we had approximately million of variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt at december  a basis point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact operating income on an annualized basis by approximately million
