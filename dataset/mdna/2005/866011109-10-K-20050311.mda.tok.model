overview 
the corporation s business has been conducted primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries  the bank  summit delaware financial corporation  sia and sbi trust 
as of december   the bank operated its branch offices in twelve locations in tarrant county  texas 
at december   the bank had seven branch offices 
the increase during was due to the may acquisition of the four branches of arlington national bank and the october opening of a branch in euless  texas 
in may  the corporation completed its acquisition of anb financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  arlington national bank collectively  anb  and anb s results of operations have been included in the corporation s results of operations since the acquisition date 
on december   the corporation effected a two for one stock split on its common stock payable in the form of a stock dividend  and all share and per share data included herein has been adjusted to reflect this stock split 
the corporation s results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the corporation s allowance for loan losses  investment activities  loan servicing fees and other fees 
the corporation s non interest expense principally consists of compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  advertising  data processing expense and other expenses 
net income for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million recorded for on a weighted average share basis  net income for was per diluted share as compared to per diluted share for  an increase of 
the increase in earnings during was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million over the increase in net interest income during was primarily due to growth in average loans of  which more than offset the impact of the low interest rate environment and a declining net interest margin during compared to excluding anb  which added million to average loans in  average loans increased over non interest income in increased million  or over anb accounted for million of this increase 
non interest expenses increased million during compared to the increase in non interest expenses was primarily due to anb  the euless location and sarbanes oxley compliance costs which added million  million and million  respectively  to the expenses 
in addition  the expense for the provision for loan losses in increased million over  virtually matching the increase in net charge offs over net charge offs for remain at low levels relative to the corporation s five year average 
continuing to reflect an improving economy in the corporation s market area as well as the anb acquisition  total loans at december  were million  which represented an increase of over total loans for total funding deposits and borrowings for also experienced growth  increasing over the prior year period to million 
shareholders equity was million at december   which represented an increase of compared to december  net income for was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million recorded for on a weighted average share basis  net income for was per diluted share as compared to per diluted share for  an increase of 
the increase in earnings during was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million over the increase in net interest income was primarily due to growth in average loans of  which more than offset the impact of the low interest rate environment and a declining net interest margin 
the increase in non interest expenses during was primarily attributable to strategic investment in new technology  new branches  new support facilities and additional lending staff 
these expenses were offset during by a significant reduction in the provision for loan losses as compared to in  loan recoveries exceeded loan losses  as credit quality and the local economy both continued to improve 
the following table shows selected performance ratios over the last three years that management believes to be key indicators of the corporation s performance return on average assets roaa return on average shareholders equity roae shareholders equity to assets average dividend payout ratio net interest margin tax equivalent efficiency ratio the return on average assets ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average total assets for the year 
management believes the corporation s return on average assets ratio of in is comparable to the return on average assets ratio of other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group  which averaged in the corporation s peer group is comprised of other publicly traded bank holding companies headquartered in texas and was selected by management of the corporation 
the return on average shareholders equity ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders equity for the year 
management believes the corporation s return on average shareholders equity ratio of in compares favorably to the return on average shareholders equity ratio of other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group  which averaged in the shareholders equity to assets ratio is calculated by dividing average shareholders equity by average total assets for the year 
management believes the corporation s average shareholders equity to average assets ratio of in is comparable to the return on average shareholders equity to average asset ratio of other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group  which averaged in the corporation s ratio is lower than its historical levels due to the anb acquisition and the significant increase in assets added 
with the anb acquisition being a cash acquisition  it resulted in the leveraging of the corporation s capital position  thus creating a lower shareholders equity to assets ratio than what the corporation has historically reported 
the dividend payout ratio is determined by dividing the total dividends paid by net income for the year 
in  the corporation s dividend payout ratio resulted in a yield to market price return comparable to the average dividend payout ratio of the corporation s peer group 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by average total earning assets 
management believes the corporation s net interest margin ratio of in compares favorably to the net interest margin ratio of other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group  which was in the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non interest expenses by the sum of total non interest income and net interest income for the year 
the efficiency ratio provides a measure of the extent to which the corporation s revenues are absorbed by its non interest expenses 
management believes the corporation s efficiency ratio of in compares favorably to the weighted average efficiency ratio of other financial institutions in the corporation s peer group  which was in net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned by the corporation on its earning assets and the interest paid by the corporation for the funds  primarily deposits  supporting those assets 
the largest category of the corporation s earning assets consists of loans to businesses and individuals 
the second largest category of the corporation s earning assets is investment securities 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and sources of funds supporting those assets  affect net interest income 
interest rates primarily are determined by national and international market trends  as well as competitive pressures in the corporation s operating markets 
for analytical purposes  income from tax exempt assets  which consists primarily of securities issued by or loans made to state and local governments  is adjusted by an increment which equates income from tax exempt assets to income from taxable assets 
net interest income tax equivalent for was million  which represented an increase of million  or  compared to the net increase in net interest income in reflected a million increase in interest income which was offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the increases in interest income and interest expense in were due to significant increases partly attributable to anb in the corporation s loans and deposits which offset decreases in the corporation s yield on earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
the yield on earning assets decreased to for from for  and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to for from for these decreases resulted in the net interest margin decreasing to in from for the decreases reflect the maturities of earning assets and time deposits originated in prior periods when market rates were higher 
market rates began increasing during the second quarter of  as measured by the increase in the average prime rate from to as published by the wall street journal of basis points 
the increase in net interest income for was primarily due to the growth in average loans and the growth in average deposits during the same period  which offset the basis point decline in net interest margin between the years of and average non interest bearing demand deposits as a percent of average total deposits increased to in from in net interest income tax equivalent for was million  which represented an increase of million  or  compared to the net increase in net interest income in reflected a million decrease in interest income which was offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
the decreases in interest income and interest expense in were primarily due to decreases in the corporation s yield on earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
the yield on earning assets decreased to for from for  and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to for from for these decreases resulted in the net interest margin decreasing to in from for the decreases in the yields earned on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities reflect the decline in market rates from to  as measured by the decline in average prime rates over the same period as published by the wall street journal of basis points 
the increase in net interest income for was primarily due to the growth in average loans and the growth in average deposits during the same period  which offset the basis point decline in net interest margin 
average non interest bearing demand deposits as a percent of average total deposits increased to in from in summary of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities although the year end detail provides satisfactory indicators of general trends  management believes the daily average balance sheets are more meaningful for analytical purposes than year end data because averages reflect the day to day fluctuations that are common to bank balance sheets 
average balances for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities also can be related directly to the components of interest income and interest expense on the consolidated statements of income 
this data provides the basis for analyzing rates earned and paid as well as sources of increases and decreases in net interest income as derived from changes in volumes and rates 
the following table presents average balance sheets for the most recent three years in a format that highlights the corporation s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities over such periods years ended december  dollars in thousands average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate earning assets federal funds sold and due from time investment securities taxable investment securities tax exempt loans  net of unearned discount total earning assets other assets cash and due from banks other assets allowance for loan losses total assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts savings certificates of deposit under  and ira s certificates of deposit  or more other time other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities other liabilities demand deposits other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income and margin t e basis loan interest income includes fees and loan volumes include loans on non accrual 
the loan fees include loan origination fees which are considered adjustments to interest income 
these fees aggregated   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
related loan origination costs are not separately allocated to loans  but are charged to non interest expense 
for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include non accrual loans with no related interest income

if market rates increase during  management expects that the net interest margin would increase from levels 
in the event that the corporation s average loans continue to grow during and the corporation is unable to fund any such growth through the generation of additional deposits  the corporation may be required to obtain funding from secondary sources  such as the federal home loan bank  which could have a negative impact on its net interest margin as compared to funding from deposits 
the table below analyzes the increase in net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis for each of the fiscal years ended december  to december  non accruing loans have been included in assets for these computations  thereby reducing yields on total loans

the increase in net interest income in was achieved  despite the decline in market rates  due to the growth in average loans and the growth in average deposits over non interest income 
non interest income is an important contributor to net income 
the major component of the corporation s non interest income is various charges and fees earned by the corporation on deposit accounts and related services

in addition  service charges on deposits from existing locations increased in primarily as a result of an increase in insufficient funds charges on deposit accounts 
the non recurring income in resulted from the gain of  on the sale of an asset previously carried in other assets and a gain of  on the partial sale of land carried in premises and equipment that was previously held for future branch expansion 
the increase in other non interest income in was primarily due to increases in income from debit card and atm fees  printed check fees  trust fees  interest recovered on loans previously on non accrual  gains on sales of student loans and insurance sales commissions 
insurance sales commissions were derived from sia and totaled  in the increase in printed check fees was due to a contractual rebate received from a new check provider 
these increases were partially offset by declines in mortgage brokerage fees which declined during primarily as a result of a reduction in mortgage re financings due to rising rates in the latter half of and a decline in letter of credit fees which were lower in due to the loss of a significant relationship during the corporation derived  of revenues in from the sale of investment brokerage services which was less than that recorded in primarily due to revenue lost in due to the merger of several banks in tarrant county involving banks that were previously investment services customers

allowance for loan losses 
each loan carried by the corporation involves some degree of inherent risk 
this risk is reflected in the consolidated financial statements through the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents the amount which  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb future charge offs of existing loans that may become uncollectible 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged against the allowance when management believes that full collection of the principal and interest is unlikely  and subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance when received 
adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are reported in the period during which such adjustments become known or are reasonably estimable 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to income in the form of a provision for loan losses when it is probable that all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan will not be collected 
the amount of the provision for loan losses is a reflection of management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and is based upon management s evaluation of a number of factors  including past loan loss experience  current and projected economic conditions  delinquency ratios and management s review of the value of discounted cash flows associated with impaired loans 
the corporation has adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure 
these standards specify how allowances for certain impaired loans should be determined and the accounting for in substance foreclosures

the decrease in provision for loan losses in from primarily reflected a continued improvement in asset quality  improvement in the local economy and a higher loan charge off rate in compared to the following table reflects the allowance for loan losses compared to total loans at the end of each year dollars in thousands december  total loans allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the following table illustrates the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the various loan categories dollars in thousands  see the table on page for the percent of specific types of loans to total loans december  amount of total amount of total amount of total amount of total amount of total allowance for loan losses commercial and industrial real estate mortgage real estate construction loans to individuals unallocated portion total the allocations are comprised of specific allocations that are determined by providing specific reserves against each loan that is criticized as defined on page under critical accounting policies as being weak  plus a general allocation against the remaining balance of the portfolio based on experience factors 
management of the corporation believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain loan losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to  or exceed  the size of the current allowance 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any loan 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  renegotiated loans  other real estate and other foreclosed assets 
non accrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended and on which the interest is recorded as earned when it is received 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not both well secured and in the process of collection  or immediately  if in the opinion of management  full collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
at the time a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest previously recorded but not collected is reversed and charged against current interest income 
renegotiated loans are loans on which the interest and or the principal have been reduced due to a deterioration in the borrower s financial condition 
even though these loans are actually performing  they are included in non performing assets because of the loss of revenue related to the reduction of interest and or principal 
other real estate is real estate acquired through foreclosure or through partial settlement of debts and which is awaiting sale and disposition 
at the time of acquisition  other real estate is recorded at the lower of estimated fair value less estimated selling costs or the loan balance or settlement agreement with any write down charged to the allowance for loan losses 
any further write downs  expenses related to the property and any gain or loss resulting from the sale of the property are recorded in current operating expenses 
other foreclosed assets are other types of collateral such as autos  shares of stock and equipment acquired through foreclosure or through partial settlement of debts which are awaiting sale and disposition 
at the time of acquisition  other foreclosed assets are recorded at the lower of estimated fair value less estimated selling costs or the loan balance or settlement agreement with any write down charged to the allowance for loan losses 
any further write downs  expenses related to the asset and any gain or loss resulting from the sale of the asset are recorded in current operating expenses 
the corporation is required  by regulatory authorities  to have other real estate and other foreclosed assets evaluated periodically 
in the event the new evaluation value is less than the carrying value of the property  the excess is written off to expense 
some properties or foreclosed assets are written down below their evaluation values when management believes the economic value has declined below the evaluation value

in addition to the above grading system  the corporation maintains a separate watch list which further aids the corporation in monitoring loan quality 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short run or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
non accrual loans normally include weaker substandard loans and loans that are considered to be doubtful which are defined later in this section 
an independent third party loan review was completed in late in addition  a regulatory examination was completed in early based on the findings of these reviews and exams  management considers the loan portfolio to be adequately reserved 
criticized loans loans classified as oaem  substandard or doubtful as noted on page have increased since a significant portion of this year over year increase is due to enhanced classification procedures and the performance of the chief credit officer employed by the corporation in the third quarter of to assist in monitoring loan quality 
in addition  million of the increase in criticized loans from to is attributable to criticized loans within the anb portfolio 
our aggressiveness in recognizing any weakness in our borrowers is the primary reason for the increase in criticized loans year over year since the corporation remains diligent in its efforts to identify any loan that might reflect weakness of the borrower as soon as possible 
management is not aware of any potential loan problems that have not been disclosed to which serious doubts exist as to the ability of the borrower to substantially comply with the present repayment terms and the corporation does not anticipate any significant losses from these downgraded credits 
the following table summarizes the relationship between non performing loans  criticized loans and the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands december  non performing loans criticized loans allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans criticized loans deposits 
the primary source of the corporation s funds is deposits 
the majority of the corporation s deposits are considered core deposits 
core deposits are those that are not subject to material changes due to customer withdrawal because of market rate changes

borrowings 
securities sold under repurchase agreements generally represent borrowings with maturities ranging from one to thirty days 
these borrowings are with significant commercial customers of the corporation that require short term liquidity for their funds 
information relating to these borrowings for the last three years is summarized as follows dollars in thousands december  securities sold under repurchase agreements average balance year end balance maximum month end balance during year interest rate average year end federal home loan bank advances average balance year end balance maximum month end balance during year interest rate average year end federal funds purchased average balance year end balance maximum month end balance during year interest rate average year end also  the corporation has available a line of credit with the federal home loan bank of dallas fhlb  which allows it to borrow on a collateralized basis at a fixed term 
the borrowings are collateralized by a blanket floating lien on all first mortgage loans which totaled million at december   the fhlb capital stock owned by the corporation and any funds on deposit with the fhlb 
at december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit at an average rate of  million of which matures during and million of which matures in april for the year ended december   the corporation had average borrowings of million under this line of credit with the fhlb 
the increase in fhlb borrowings in coincided with the significant increase in loans during the year 
at december   the corporation had million of borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at an average rate of  million of which matured during and million of which matures in april in addition  from time to time the corporation purchases federal funds from correspondent banks to meet periodic liquidity needs

on september   the corporation obtained a line of credit from a bank under which the corporation may borrow million at a floating rate three month libor plus a margin of 
the line of credit is secured by stock of the bank and matures on september   whereupon  if balances are outstanding  the line converts to a term note having a five year term 
the corporation will not pay a fee for any unused portion of the line

off balance sheet arrangements  commitments  guarantees and contractual obligations 
in the normal course of business  the corporation enters into various transactions  which  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  are not included in its consolidated balance sheets 
the corporation enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the corporation enters into contractual loan commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of the corporation s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
the corporation minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the corporation would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the corporation could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  the corporation would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
the corporation s policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
the following table summarizes the corporation s contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of december  dollars in thousands 
payments for borrowings do not include interest 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
loan commitments and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts  however  since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used  the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
payments due by period year or less more than year but less than years years or more but less than years years or more total contractual obligations federal home loan bank advances operating leases deposits with stated maturity dates total other commitments loan commitments standby letters of credit total total contractual obligations and other commitments interest rate sensitivity 
the objectives of monitoring and managing the interest rate risk of the balance sheet are to contribute to earnings by minimizing adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates and to provide liquidity to satisfy cash flow requirements to meet customers fluctuating demands 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in the market interest rates and changes in net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an asset sensitive position in a given period will result in more assets than liabilities being subject to repricing  therefore  market interest rate changes will be reflected more quickly in asset rates 
if interest rates decline  such a position will have an adverse effect on net interest income 
conversely  in a liability sensitive position  where liabilities reprice more quickly than assets in a given period  a decline in market rates will benefit net interest income 
a mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in which relatively equal volumes reprice each period represents a matched interest sensitivity gap position  any excess of these assets or liabilities results in an interest sensitive gap 
the following table  commonly referred to as a static gap report  indicates the interest rate sensitivity position at december  and may not be reflective of positions in subsequent periods dollars in thousands due in days or less due in days due in days to one year total rate sensitive repriced after year or non rate sensitive total earning assets loans investment securities federal funds sold due from time total earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts and savings certificates of deposit under  and ira s certificates of deposit of  or more other time deposits other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative gap periodic gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets in the preceding table under the repriced after year or non rate sensitive category  million in investment securities will reprice or mature within one to three years and another million will reprice or mature within three to five years 
the average maturity of the investment portfolio is approximately years 
also  the above table reflects the call dates versus maturity dates and periodic principal amortization of investment securities 
the preceding static gap report reflects a cumulative liability sensitive position during the one year horizon 
an inherent weakness of this report is that it ignores the relative volatility any one category may have in relation to other categories or market rates in general 
for instance  the rate paid on certain interest bearing transaction accounts typically adjusts less quickly than the three month t bill 
management attempts to capture this relative volatility by utilizing a simulation model with a beta factor adjustment which estimates the volatility of rate sensitive assets and or liabilities in relation to other market rates 
beta factors are an estimation of the long term  multiple interest rate environment relation between an individual account and market rates in general 
for instance  now  savings and money market accounts  which are repriceable within days will have considerably lower beta factors than variable rate loans and most investment categories 
taking this into consideration  it is quite possible for a bank with a negative cumulative gap to total asset ratio to have a positive beta adjusted gap risk position 
as a result of applying the beta factors established by the corporation s management to the earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in the static gap report via a simulation model  the corporation s cumulative gap to total assets ratio at one year of was reversed to a positive beta adjusted gap position 
management feels that the beta adjusted gap risk technique more accurately reflects the corporation s gap position 
in addition to gap analysis  the corporation uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet  respectively 
contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions  maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio 
assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for non maturity deposit accounts 
based on the december  simulation analysis  it is estimated that a basis point rise in interest rates over the next month period would have an impact of approximately a increase on net interest income for the period  while a basis point decline in interest rates over the same period would have an impact of approximately an decrease on net interest income for the period 
these varying results are primarily a product of the manner in which interest rates on demand  money market and savings deposits change 
the corporation has found that historically  interest rates on these deposits change more slowly in a rising rate environment than in a declining rate environment 
this assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis 
the analysis does not contemplate any actions that the corporation might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to be and does not provide a forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on the corporation

the corporation and the bank are subject to capital adequacy guidelines established by the frb and other regulatory authorities

the decline in the percentages between the years is primarily due to the growth in loans as a percent of assets during loans are generally classified in the risk category for the purpose of these calculations 
as of december  and  the corporation and the bank exceeded the risk based capital and leverage requirements set by regulatory authorities and satisfied the criteria for classification as a well capitalized institution under the rules of fdicia 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these classifications 
liquidity 
liquidity is defined as the corporation s ability to meet deposit withdrawals  provide for the legitimate credit needs of customers and take advantage of certain investment opportunities as they arise 
while maintaining adequate liquid assets to fulfill these functions  it must also maintain compatible levels of maturity and rate concentrations between its sources of funds and earning assets 
the liability structure of the corporation is short term in nature and the asset structure is likewise oriented towards short maturities 
the corporation s primary internal sources of liquidity consist of the federal funds that it sells and its portfolio of marketable investment securities  particularly those with shorter maturities 
federal funds sold and investment securities maturing within days represented million  or  of total assets as of december  additionally  the corporation s ability to sell loan participations  purchase federal funds and obtain advances from the fhlb serve as secondary sources of liquidity 
the bank has approved federal funds lines at other banks 
the corporation has available a line of credit with the fhlb that allows it to borrow on a collateralized basis at a fixed term 
at december   million of borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit at an average rate of  million of which matures during and million of which matures in april in addition  on september   the corporation obtained a line of credit from a bank under which the corporation may borrow million at a floating rate 
at december   million had been borrowed under this line and the rate on this line was 
on may   sbi trust issued million of trust capital securities as well as trust common securities in the aggregate liquidation value of  the proceeds from the issuance of these securities were invested in the deferrable debentures of the corporation  which mature on july  and have a call feature that permits the corporation to redeem any or all of the deferrable debentures after july  at december   the interest rate on the deferrable debentures was 
the liquidity of the corporation is enhanced by the fact that of its total deposits at december  were core deposits 
for this purpose  core deposits are defined as total deposits less public funds and certificates of deposit greater than  also  the corporation s loan to deposit ratio averaged for the year 
in the event that the corporation s average loans continue to grow during and the corporation is unable to fund such growth through the generation of additional deposits  the corporation may be required to obtain funding from secondary sources  including purchasing federal funds  obtaining advances from the fhlb or other secondary sources 
in such event  the corporation s business  results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
the corporation s income  which provides funds for the payment of dividends to shareholders and for other corporate purposes  is derived from its investment in the bank 
impact of inflation 
the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the corporation s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  investments  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the corporation attempts to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
related party transactions 
the bank has made transactions in the ordinary course of business with certain of its and the corporation s officers  directors and their affiliates 
all loans included in such transactions are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rate and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and all loans are current as to principal and interest payments 
total loans outstanding to such parties amounted to approximately  at december  and  at december  subsequent events 
on december   the corporation effected a two for one stock split payable in the form of a stock dividend payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  on january   the board of directors of the corporation declared a quarterly dividend of per share to be paid on february  to shareholders of record on january  critical accounting policies 
the corporation s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the corporation has identified its policy with respect to allowance for loan losses as critical because it requires management to make particularly difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the corporation  in consultation with the audit committee of the board of directors  has reviewed and approved this critical accounting policy  which is further described under the caption loans and allowance for loan losses in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount maintained in the allowance reflects management s continuing assessment of the potential losses inherent in its loan portfolio based on evaluations of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  current loan portfolio quality  present and future economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses generally associated with bank lending inherent in its current loan portfolio 
in making these evaluations  management and the loan committee of the board of directors take into account past loan loss experience  delinquency ratios and the analysis of third party loan review specialists 
the allocation of the allowance is determined by providing specific reserves against each loan that is criticized as being weak plus a general allocation against the remaining balance of the portfolio based on experience factors 
the loans are graded on a system similar to that used by the banking industry regulators 
the first level of criticized loans is other assets especially mentioned oaem 
these loans are fundamentally sound but have potential weaknesses which may  if not corrected  weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s credit position at some future date 
the second level is substandard  which are loans inadequately protected by current sound net worth  paying capacity or pledged collateral of the borrower 
the last level of criticized loans  before they are charged off  is doubtful 
doubtful loans are considered to have inherent weaknesses because collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable 
the general allocation is based upon the corporation s loss experience over a period of years and is adjusted for subjective factors such as economic trends  performance trends and concentrations of credit 
at december   the general allocation rate of the allowance was 
these evaluations are inherently subjective because  even though they are based on objective data  it is management s interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance 
therefore  from time to time but at least quarterly  management reviews the actual performance and write off history of the loan portfolio and compares that to previously determined allowance coverage percentages 
in this manner  management evaluates the impact the previously mentioned variables may have had on the loan portfolio to determine which changes  if any  should be made to the assumptions and analyses 
recent analysis has indicated that projections of estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio has approximated actual write off experience during the current economic environment 
actual results could differ materially from estimates as a result of changes in economic or market conditions and other factors 
changes in the corporation s evaluations and the assumptions underlying these evaluations could result in a material change in the allowance 
while the corporation believes that the allowance for loan losses has been established and maintained at levels adequate to reflect the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  future increases may be necessary if economic or market conditions and other factors differ substantially from the conditions that existed at the time of the initial determinations 
factors that may affect future results
