the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with vcampus consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview our revenues are derived from three primary sources online tuition revenues  development revenues  and other service revenues 
online tuition revenues are generated primarily from online tuition derived from corporate  government  and higher education customers and sales of our select partner courseware 
development revenues consist primarily of fees paid to us for creating and developing new online courseware and web enabling existing courseware 
other service revenues consisted primarily of monthly fees generated by the maintenance of the cybis courseware under contract with the us army 
on june   our board of directors approved a one for ten reverse stock split of our common stock 
the reverse stock split became effective as of the opening of trading on july  stockholders equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the reverse stock split for all periods presented by reclassifying the excess par value resulting from the reduced number of shares from common stock to paid in capital 
all references to common share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on practices  information provided by our customers and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the following sources online tuition revenues  other service revenues and development and other revenues 
revenue is recognized in accordance with either sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  or statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
both sab and sop generally require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain sales  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
online tuition revenues are generated primarily through three types of contracts i contracts with higher education partners  ii corporate subscriptions  and iii corporate usage 
for higher education partner contracts and corporate subscriptions  revenue is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the semester term and subscription period  respectively 
for usage contracts  revenue is recognized upon enrollment in a course 
once a student has enrolled in a course  he cannot cancel delivery of a course or receive a refund 
revenue from the sale of select partner courseware is generally recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the length of the subscription period 
initial set up fees related to all online tuition services are recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the respective contract term 
development and other revenues earned under courseware conversion contracts are recognized relative to our proportionate performance based on the ratio that total costs incurred to date bear to the total estimated costs of the contract 
provisions for losses on contracts are made in the period in which they are determined 
prior to the third quarter of  we had also been recognizing revenues for other services 
revenues for other services were being recognized as the services were delivered 
we have ceased providing these other services 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of those customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
capitalized software and courseware development costs during  and  we capitalized certain software and courseware development costs 
we capitalize the cost of software used for internal operations once technological feasibility of the software has been demonstrated 
we capitalize costs incurred during the development process  including payroll costs for employees who are directly associated with the development process and services performed by consultants 
amortization of such costs is based on the greater of the ratio of current gross revenues to the sum of current and anticipated gross revenues  or the straight line method over the remaining economic life of the vcampus or courseware  typically two to three years 
it is possible that those anticipated gross revenues  the remaining economic life of the products  or both  may be reduced as a result of future events 
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles management assesses the recoverability of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when management determines that the carrying value of goodwill or other identifiable intangibles is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value can be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices  valuations by third parties and discounted cash flow analysis 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  we ceased amortizing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles on january  in lieu of amortization  these assets are subject to an annual impairment review 
we may determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles have been impaired  resulting in an impairment charge in the period the review is completed

other income in consists of the extinguishment of liabilities comprised of customer deposits and prepayments 
these prepayments and deposits were received prior to december  and were for classroom training to be delivered by htr and per the terms of the arrangement with customers  they were non refundable 
our htr subsidiary ceased operations in december liquidity and capital resources at december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  compared to  at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents during is principally due to the receipt of cash proceeds from the equity and convertible debt financing we completed in march  as reduced by the net loss recorded 
since our inception  we have financed our operating cash flow needs primarily through offerings of equity and debt securities and  to a lesser extent  borrowings 
cash utilized in operating activities was  in and  in use of cash was primarily attributable to the net loss recorded 
cash utilized in investing activities was  in and  in the use of cash for investing activities was primarily attributable to investments in software and courseware development and  to a lesser extent  purchases of equipment  cash provided by financing activities was  in and  in in march  we raised  in gross cash proceeds through the private placement of units  at a purchase price of  per unit  and series b senior secured convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of  each unit consisted of  shares of common stock at per share  a series a senior secured convertible note in the original principal amount of  and a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
we issued an additional  of series b senior secured notes in exchange for cancellation of existing short term indebtedness in that amount 
we issued to the series b noteholders five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the exercise price for the warrants  as adjusted upon shareholder approval in may  is per share upon approval of the private placement by vcampus stockholders at our annual meeting on may    of principal of each of the series a notes was converted into common stock at per share and  or  in principal of each of the series b notes was converted into common stock at per share 
the total principal amount for both series converted upon approval of the stockholders was  therefore  following stockholder approval  a total of  of the placement was recorded as equity and  as senior debt 
the notes mature on april  and bear interest at the rate of per annum payable quarterly in cash or stock valued at the conversion price at vcampus option for the first year 
principal and interest on the notes are payable in cash over the following four years in quarterly installments 
interest due for the quarters ended june  september and december  in the aggregate of  was paid through the issuance an aggregate of  shares of common stock valued at per share 
absent any voluntary conversions of the convertible notes into common stock  interest expense payable by us under the notes in cash for the balance of will be approximately  during  an additional  of series a and series b senior secured convertible note principal was converted into  shares of common stock  resulting in  of aggregate principal from this financing converted as of the end of during  we issued  shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants and options 
net cash proceeds to us from these exercises amounted to  in march  we raised  in gross proceeds through the issuance of  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share to accredited investors 
under the terms of this financing  we also issued five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share to the same accredited investors 
in connection with this financing  we paid a placement agent a fee equivalent to of the amount raised  paid in common stock 
as this was a placement of common stock  the fair value of the warrants issued was accounted for as cost of capital 
we have incurred significant losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we expect negative cash flow from operations to continue until the online revenue stream matures 
in addition  we have experienced declining revenues in the current and prior periods  including the loss of a major customer in which represented of revenues in management s plans to address these conditions include sales to new customers through the select partner program which have partially replaced the sales related to the customer lost in management anticipates the increase in sales seen in the current and prior periods under the select partner program to continue in management has also instituted cost cutting measures and operates under an approved budget  which is closely monitored 
management is committed to maintaining operations at current levels to meet projected sales levels 
however  in the event revenues do not meet anticipated levels or we are unable to raise additional funding to meet working capital requirements  we may need to further significantly reduce operating expenses 
if we are not able to address our funding needs  we will be materially adversely affected 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  acceptance of and demand for our products and services including the select partner business model  customer demands for technology upgrades  the types of arrangements that we may enter into with customers and agents  and the extent to which the we invest in new technology and research and development projects 
while we believe we have the ability to raise additional capital  our ability to raise capital in the near term is uncertain 
if we are unable to raise additional funding to meet working capital requirements  we may unable to maintain compliance with nasdaq smallcap market listing requirements and we might not be able to achieve our business objectives 
vcampus believes it has available capital on hand and sources for additional debt and equity capital in amounts necessary to meet its cash needs into however  such capital  if needed and available  may not have terms favorable to us or our current stockholders 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes  which will expire at various dates through our ability to utilize all of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited by changes in ownership 
we have recognized a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not be generated during the carryforward period available under the tax law to utilize the deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations our future liquidity and capital resources will be affected by our contractual obligations 
our significant contractual obligations as of december  are for debt and operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations are summarized as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter notes payable operating leases purchase obligation total contractual obligations in march  we raised  in gross cash proceeds through the private placement of units  at a purchase price of  per unit  and series b senior secured convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of  each unit consisted of  shares of common stock initially priced at per share  a series a senior secured convertible note in the original principal amount of  and a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
we issued an additional  of series b senior secured notes in exchange for cancellation of existing short term indebtedness in that amount 
upon approval of the private placement by vcampus stockholders at our annual meeting on may    of principal of each of the series a notes was converted into common stock at per share and  or  in principal of each of the series b notes was converted into common stock at per share 
the total principal amount for both series converted upon approval of the stockholders was  therefore  following stockholder approval  a total of  of the placement was recorded as equity and  as senior debt 
the notes mature on april  and bear interest at the rate of per annum payable quarterly in cash or stock valued at the conversion price at vcampus option for the first year 
principal and interest on the notes are payable in cash over the following four years in quarterly installments 
during  an additional  of series a and series b senior secured convertible note principal was converted into  shares of common stock  resulting in  of aggregate principal from this financing converted as of the end of in december  we entered into a three year subsequently amended to a four year reseller agreement with a vendor to resell certain courseware 
the agreement  as amended  requires us to generate sales of the vendor s courseware sufficient to generate royalties of  over the four year period 
as of december   we were required to generate sales sufficient to generate royalties of  prior to january  in january  we extended the reseller agreement for another year 
pursuant to this extension  we were allowed carry up to  of the unsatisfied portion of our commitment to this vendor into the twelve months ending january   which is the period of the renewal 
we have not engaged in off balance sheet financing or commodity contract trading 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payments be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition  sfas no 
r establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
the company believes the pro forma disclosures note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the consolidated financial statements under the sub heading stock based compensation provide an appropriate short term indicator of the level of expense that will be recognized in accordance with sfas r 
however  the total expense recorded in future periods will depend on several variables  including the number of shared based awards that vest and the fair value of those vested awards 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in the fiscal year beginning january  sfas requires that exchanges of productive assets be accounted for at fair value unless fair value cannot be reasonably determined or the transaction lacks commercial substance 
sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which updates the guidance in sab no 
 integrates the related set of frequently asked questions  and recognizes the role of eitf the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to a variety of risks including market risk associated with interest rate movements 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to any investments we may hold at various times and also related to its long term debt 
when investing  our purchases consist of highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase generally no greater than twelve months  thus  due to the short term nature of such investments and our usual intention to hold these investments until maturity  the impact of interest rate changes would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
in addition  all of our long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates 
given the fixed rate nature of the debt  the impact of interest rate changes also would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
if we receive payments in local currencies when delivering courses in overseas markets  we could experience losses in connection with currency translation
