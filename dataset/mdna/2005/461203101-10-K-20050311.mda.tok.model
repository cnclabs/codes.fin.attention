item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
outlook uncertainty related to medicare s reimbursement policies for power wheelchairs is now expected to continue throughout the new proposed criteria from cms require public comment before implementation 
the resulting ambiguity that is impacting the consumer power wheelchair market likely will not be clarified until late  although cms has recently indicated it will try and finalize the new criteria in the first half of adding to the problems arising from the reimbursement difficulties  there will be additional confusion resulting from medicare s plan to expand coding of the power wheelchair reimbursement system from codes to codes in january despite the reimbursement pressures  the company believes that it will have a net sales increase of between and  with acquisitions contributing between and and currency translation contributing a minimal amount 
earnings per share is expected to be between and in  excluding the impact from the stock option accounting standard recently announced by the financial accounting standards board 
invacare believes it can still grow and thrive despite the fact that the home care industry has not received any cost of living adjustments over the last few years and government regulatory landscape is uncertain 
the company expects that the blended cut for the items affected by recent government regulations will be around  which should negatively affect consolidated net sales by around 
however  invacare s new products  for example  the low cost oxygen delivery system of homefill tm  can help address the cuts the home care provider has to endure 
we will continue to focus on developing products that help the provider improve profitability 
with such products  invacare believes it can grow and offset the risks 
additionally  invacare will accelerate its activities in china to make sure that we are one of the lowest cost manufacturers and distributors to the home care provider

the company attempts to minimize or offset the effects through increased sales volume  capital expenditure programs designed to improve productivity  alternative sourcing of material and other cost control measures 
in and  the company was able to offset the majority of the impact of price increases from suppliers by productivity improvements and other cost reduction activities 
liquidity and capital resources the company continues to maintain an adequate liquidity position through its unused bank lines of credit see long term debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and working capital management 
the company maintains various bank lines of credit to finance its worldwide operations 
in  the company issued  in senior notes  which are due between and in  the company completed a  multi currency  long term revolving credit agreement  which was replaced on january   along with a  euro bridge agreement entered into in  by a new  multi currency  long term revolving credit agreement

additionally  the company maintains various other demand lines of credit totaling a us dollar equivalent of approximately  as of december  the lines of credit along with cash generated from operations have been and will continue to be used to fund the company s domestic and foreign working capital  capital expenditures and acquisition requirements 
as of december   the company had approximately  available under its various lines of credit  excluding debt covenant restrictions 
i the company s borrowing arrangements contain covenants with respect to  among other items  interest coverage  net worth  dividend payments  working capital  and funded debt to capitalization  as defined in the company s bank agreements and agreement with its note holders

while there is general concern about the potential for rising interest rates  exposure to interest rate fluctuations is manageable given that a portion of the debt is at fixed rates through in addition  the ability to terminate existing swaps that exchange fixed rate debt to variable and to utilize interest rate swaps to fix a higher percentage of the company s debt coupled with free cash flow should allow invacare to absorb the expected modest rate increases in the months ahead without any material impact on our liquidity or capital resources

cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities were  in  compared to  last year 
the decrease is due primarily to increases in installment receivables and inventory and a decline in accrued expenses primarily related to reduced customer rebates 
these were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
cash flows used for investing activities were  in  compared to  in the increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with acquired businesses with the domus acquisition being the most significant 
in addition  purchases of property and equipment activity in was higher compared to the prior year as the company is in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning systems in north america  europe and asia pacific

in addition to acquisition activities  the effect of foreign currency translation results in amounts being shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows that are different from the changes reflected in the respective balance sheet captions 
during  the company generated free cash flow of  compared to free cash flow of  in the decrease was primarily attributable to additional capital expenditures made in  primarily for enterprise resource planning systems as well as increases in installment receivables and inventory coupled with a decline in accrued expenses  primarily related to reduced customer rebates 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure that is comprised of net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment 
management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the overall financial performance of the company and its ability to repay debt or make future investments including acquisitions  etc the non gaap financial measure is reconciled to the gaap measure as follows in thousands twelve months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   adjusted for purchases of property and equipment   free cash flow   i contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations senior notes      revolving credit agreements      other notes  operating lease obligations      capital lease obligations      purchase obligations primarily computer systems   contracts other long term obligations product liability      serp     other  principally deferred compensation    total      dividend policy it is the company s policy to pay a nominal dividend in order for its stock to be more attractive to a broader range of investors 
the current annual dividend rate remains at per common share and per class b common share 
it is not anticipated that this will change materially as the company continues to have available significant growth opportunities through internal development and acquisitions

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majority owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition invacare s revenues are recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  as updated by sab no 
 provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
sales are only made to customers with whom the company believes collection is reasonably assured based upon a credit analysis  which may include obtaining a credit application  a signed security agreement  personal guarantee and or a cross corporate guarantee depending on the credit history of the customer 
credit lines are established for new customers after an evaluation of their credit report and or other relevant financial information 
existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts 
the company offers discounts and rebates  which are accounted for as reductions to revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized 
discounts offered include cash discounts for prompt payment  base and trade discounts based on contract level for specific classes of customers 
volume discounts and rebates are given based on large purchases and the achievement of certain sales volumes 
product returns are accounted for as a reduction to reported sales with estimates recorded for anticipated returns at the time of sale 
the company does not sell any goods on consignment 
distributed products sold by the company are accounted for in accordance with eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company records distributed product sales gross as a principal since the company takes title to the products and has the risks of loss for collections  delivery and returns 
i product sales that give rise to installment receivables are recorded at the time of sale when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with dll  a third party financing company  to provide the majority of future lease financing to invacare customers 
as such  interest income is recognized based on the terms of the installment agreements 
installment accounts are monitored and if a customer defaults on payments  interest income is no longer recognized 
all installment accounts are accounted for using the same methodology  regardless of duration of the installment agreements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from health care  medical equipment dealers and long term care facilities located throughout the united states  australia  canada  new zealand and europe 
a significant portion of products sold to dealers  both foreign and domestic  is ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 
in addition  the company has seen a significant shift in reimbursement to customers from managed care entities 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on dealer liquidity and profitability 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management s evaluation of the financial condition of the customer 
in addition  as a result of the third party financing arrangement with dll  management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company s limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost principally determined for domestic manufacturing inventories by the last in  first out lifo method and for non domestic inventories and domestic finished products purchased for resale by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
a provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded as needed based upon the discontinuation of products  redesigning of existing products  new product introductions  market changes and safety issues 
both raw materials and finished goods are reserved for on the balance sheet 
in general  we review inventory turns as an indicator of obsolescence or slow moving product as well as the impact of new product introductions 
depending on the situation  the individual item may be partially or fully reserved for 
no inventory that was reserved for has been sold at prices above their new cost basis 
in  individual items were both partially and fully written down 
the company continued to increase its overseas sourcing efforts  increase its emphasis on the development and introduction of new products  and decrease the cycle time to bring new product offerings to market 
these initiatives are sources of inventory obsolescence for both raw material and finished goods 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  equipment  intangibles and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
furthermore  goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company completed the required initial analysis of goodwill as of january  as well the annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of  and the results of these analyses indicated no impairment of goodwill 
product liability the company s captive insurance company  invatection insurance co  currently has a policy year that runs from september to august and insures annual policy losses of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate of the company s north american product liability exposure 
the company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage insuring  in annual aggregate losses arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits 
there can be no assurance that invacare s current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates 
product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience  industry expertise and indications from the third party actuary 
additional reserves  in excess of the specific individual case reserves  are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon third party actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted 
historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the third party actuary to estimate the ultimate reserves 
for example  the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience  the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate 
estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss award settlements on claims 
while actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves  the company accepts responsibility for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices 
i warranty generally  the company s products are covered by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for periods up to six years from the date of sale to the customer 
certain components carry a lifetime warranty 
a provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience 
the company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accrual and makes adjustments as needed 
historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company s warranty reserves 
claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed 
however  the company does consider other events  such as a product recall  which could warrant additional warranty reserve provision 
no material adjustments to warranty reserves were necessary in the current year 
see current liabilities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual 
accounting for stock based compensation the company accounts for options under its stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method proscribed in accounting principles board opinion apbo no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
the majority of the options awarded have been granted at exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  thus  no compensation cost has been reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings for these options 
in addition  restricted stock awards have been granted without cost to the recipients and are being expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting periods

 the company has modified its disclosures to comply with the new statement 
see the company s accounting policies and shareholders equity transactions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions 
the process requires estimating our current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies 
the temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities 
the company also must estimate the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and whether or not valuation allowances should be established 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  the company s provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
the company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies
