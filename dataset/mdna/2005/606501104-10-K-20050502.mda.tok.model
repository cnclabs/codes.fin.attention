item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and part ii  item a 
controls and procedures  as well as other written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by us and our representatives in other reports  filings with the united states securities and exchange commission the sec  press releases  conferences  or otherwise  may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section le of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
this information includes  without limitation  statements concerning o our future financial position and results of operations  o planned capital expenditures  o our business strategy and other plans for future operations  o the future mix of revenues and business  o our commitments and contingent liabilities  o future demand for our services  and o predicted improvement in energy industry and seismic service industry conditions 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
when used in this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  and similar expressions  as they relate to the company and our management  identify forward looking statements 
the actual results of future events described in such forward looking statements could differ materially from the results described in the forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties set forth below and elsewhere within this annual report on form k 
demand for land based seismic data is not assured demand for our services depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  production and development activities  as well as on the number of crews conducting land and transition zone seismic data acquisition worldwide 
the levels of such spending are influenced by o oil and gas prices and industry perceptions of future price levels  o the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  o the availability of current geophysical data  o the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  and o local and international political and economic conditions 
the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry has a significant effect on our revenues and profitability 
historically  prices of oil and gas  as well as the level of exploration and developmental activity  have fluctuated substantially 
this has  in the past  and may  in the future  adversely affect our business 
we are unable to predict future oil and gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity 
a prolonged low level of activity in the oil and gas industry will likely depress development activity  adversely affecting the demand for our products and services and our financial condition and results of operations 
loss of significant customers will adversely affect us we typically lease and sell significant amounts of seismic equipment to a relatively small number of customers  the composition of which changes from year to year as leases are initiated and concluded and as customers equipment needs vary 
therefore  at any one time  a large portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of customers 
in the fiscal years ended january   and  the single largest customer accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 

table of contents because our customer base is relatively small  the loss of one or more customers for any reason could adversely affect our results of operations 
significant defaults of past due customer accounts would adversely affect our results of operations on january   we had approximately million of customer accounts and notes receivable of which million was over days past due 
at january   we had an allowance of million to cover losses in our receivable balances 
significant payment defaults by our customers in excess of the allowance would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
international economic and political instability could adversely our results of operations our results of operations are dependent upon the current political and economic climate of several international countries in which our customers either operate or are located 
international sources including canada accounted for approximately of our revenues in the fiscal year ended january  since the majority of our lease and sales contracts with our customers are denominated in us  australian and canadian dollars  there is some risk of economic as opposed to accounting loss from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
however  our internationally sourced revenues are still subject to the risk of currency exchange controls in which payment could not be made in us dollars  taxation policies  and expropriation  as well as to political turmoil  civil disturbances  armed hostilities  and other hazards 
foreign currency exchange rates have increasingly materially affected our results of operations for accounting purposes  balance sheet accounts of the canadian and australian subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period 
statement of operations items are translated at average currency exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
this translation adjustment has become material because of the significant amount of equipment assigned to our canadian operations and the significant fluctuations in the canadian dollar exchange rate over the last few years 
our operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to continually obtain additional lease contracts our seismic equipment leases typically have a term of three to nine months and provide gross revenues that recover only a portion of our capital investment 
our ability to generate lease revenues and profits is dependent on obtaining additional lease contracts after the termination of an original lease 
however  lessees are under no obligation to  and frequently do not  continue to lease seismic equipment after the expiration of a lease 
although we have been successful in obtaining additional lease contracts with other lessees after the termination of the original leases  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so 
our failure to obtain additional leases or extensions beyond the initial lease term would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
we depend on key personnel our success is dependent on  among other things  the services of certain key personnel  including specifically billy f 
mitcham  jr  our president and chief executive officer 
mr 
mitcham s employment agreement is automatically renewed on a year to year basis until terminated by either party giving days notice prior to the end of the current term subject to earlier termination on certain stated events 
the agreement prohibits mr 
mitcham from engaging in any business activities that are competitive with our business and from diverting any of our customers to a competitor for two years after the termination of his employment 
the loss of the services of mr 
mitcham could have a material adverse effect on us 
our seismic lease pool is subject to technological obsolescence we have a substantial capital investment in seismic data acquisition equipment 
the development by manufacturers of seismic equipment of newer technology systems or component parts that have significant competitive advantages over seismic systems and component parts now in use could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably lease and sell our existing seismic equipment 
significant improvements in technology may also require us to recognize an asset impairment charge to our lease pool investment  and to correspondingly invest significant sums to 
table of contents upgrade or replace our existing lease pool with newer technology equipment demanded by our customers 
weather conditions cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year have historically accounted for a greater portion of our revenues than do our second and third quarters 
this seasonality in revenues is primarily due to the increased seismic survey activity in canada from november through march 
this seasonal pattern may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
we face competition in our seismic equipment leasing activities we have several competitors engaged in seismic equipment leasing and sales  including seismic equipment manufacturers and data acquisition contractors that use seismic equipment  many of which have substantially greater financial resources than us 
there are also several smaller competitors that  in the aggregate  generate significant revenue from the sale of seismic survey equipment 
pressures from existing or new competitors could adversely affect our business operations 
we are also aware of several companies that engage in seismic equipment leasing 
we believe that our competitors  in general  have neither as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool as we do  or similar exclusive lease referral agreements with suppliers 
competition exists to a lesser extent from seismic data acquisition contractors that may lease equipment that is temporarily idle 
our stock price is subject to volatility due to recent energy industry conditions  energy and energy service company stock prices  including our stock price  have been extremely volatile 
such stock price volatility could adversely affect our business operations by  among other things  impeding our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to obtain additional financing 
we rely on a small number of suppliers and disruption in vendor supplies could adversely affect our results of operations we purchase the majority of our seismic equipment for our lease pool from a small number of suppliers 
we believe we have satisfactory relationships with our suppliers 
however  should those relationships deteriorate  we may have difficulty in obtaining new technology demanded by our customers and maintaining the existing equipment in accordance with manufacturers specifications 
in addition  we may  from time to time  experience supply or quality control problems with suppliers  and these problems could significantly affect our ability to meet our lease commitments 
reliance on certain suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involve several risks  including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key products and increases in product costs and reduced control over delivery schedules  any of these could adversely affect our future results of operations 
possible adverse effect of anti takeover provisions  potential issuance of preferred stock certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the texas business corporation act may tend to delay  defer or prevent a potential unsolicited offer or takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors but that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interest  including an attempt that might result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares 
because our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with such preferences and rights as it determines  it may afford the holders of any series of preferred stock preferences  rights or voting powers superior to those of the holders of common stock 
although we have no shares of preferred stock outstanding and no present intention to issue any shares of our preferred stock  there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future 
item properties we own our corporate office and warehouse facilities in huntsville  texas 
our headquarters facility consists of  square feet of office and warehouse space on approximately six acres 
we also lease approximately  square feet of office and warehouse space at our facility in calgary  canada 
sap leases approximately  square

dividend policy we have not paid any cash dividends on the common stock since our inception  and our board of directors does not contemplate the payment of cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
it is the present policy of the board of directors to retain earnings  if any  for use in developing and expanding our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our revenues are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors  which in turn are affected by expectations regarding the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  energy prices and finding and development costs 
seismic data acquisition activity levels are measured in terms of the number of active recording crews  known as the crew count  and the number of recording channels deployed by those crews 
because an accurate and reliable census of active crews does not exist  it is not possible to make definitive statements regarding the absolute levels of seismic data acquisition activity 
furthermore  a significant number of seismic data acquisition contractors are either private or state owned enterprises and information about their activities is not available in the public domain 
due to our unique position as the largest independent lessor of seismic equipment  we believe that we are privy to information about future projects from many data acquisition contractors 
as a result  we believe that the seismic exploration market is improving 
we believe that this increase is being driven by historically high world oil and north american natural gas prices  combined with the maturation of the world s hydrocarbon producing basins 
the future direction and magnitude of changes in seismic data acquisition activity levels will continue to be dependent upon oil and natural gas prices 
we lease and sell seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies conducting land and transition zone seismic surveys worldwide 
we provide short term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer s requirements and offer technical support during the lease term 
the majority of all active leases at january  were for a term of less than one year 
seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
in addition to leasing seismic data acquisition equipment  sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
our lease revenue is seasonal  especially in canada  where a significant percentage of seismic survey activity occurs in the winter months  from november through march 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other equipment because of the unstable terrain 
this seasonal leasing activity by our canadian customers has historically resulted in increased lease revenues in our first and fourth fiscal quarters 
for the years ended january   and  revenues from foreign customers totaled million  million and million  representing  and of consolidated revenues in those fiscal years  respectively 
the majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in united states  australian and canadian dollars 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded net income from continuing operations in the approximate amount of million  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of approximately million and million for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended january  was million compared to a net loss of million and million for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
during fiscal  our results of operations were affected by several significant factors 
our revenues increased million  reflecting a significant increase in leasing and a moderate increase in sales from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenues was attributable to several factors 
our increase in leasing revenues was largely attributable to the significant increase in leasing activities recorded by sap and our us operations 
also contributing to our increase in fiscal revenues was a general increase in demand for short term rentals in the united states from some of our seismic contractor customers 
we believe that this increased demand resulted from the decision by a major contractor to cease land based operations in north america  which benefited our customers due to the reduced level of competition 
our fixed and variable costs are an important factor affecting our results of operations 
due to the size and age of our seismic equipment lease pool  depreciation expense  which amounted to million for the year ended january   was our single largest expense item 
this expense will vary between periods based on 
table of contents acquisitions of new equipment and sales of equipment with remaining depreciable life 
direct cost of seismic leasing is a variable expense that fluctuates with our equipment leasing revenues 
the main components of this cost are freight  sublease expenses and repairs and maintenance  to the extent that repairs performed are normal wear and tear and not billable to the lease customer 
revenues for fiscal  our consolidated revenues increased million  or  to million from fiscal  representing increases in both leasing and sales activity for the year 
during fiscal  leasing revenues increased million  of which approximately million was related to rentals of marine equipment during the prior fiscal year that had not been recognized due to collectibility issues 
in july  we agreed to accept certain marine seismic equipment owned by the customer and valued at approximately million as partial payment for the invoices billed but not paid as of that date 
the equipment was appraised by a third party and such values were used as the basis for the settlement of these outstanding receivables 
additionally  our leasing revenues significantly increased in our australian and us operations but were partly offset by a decrease from our canadian operations 
a weakened us dollar and its impact on foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing consolidated revenues during the year ended january  by million over the prior year 
for fiscal  consolidated revenues increased million  or  to million from fiscal  driven by increases in both leasing and sales activity during the year 
consolidated revenues for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  from fiscal due mainly to the loss of three significant customers that ceased operations in fiscal during fiscal  leasing revenues increased million  primarily as a result of an increase in our north american revenues  our expanding marine seismic business  our first large rental contract in the southeast asia market  and the inclusion of the operations of sap  which we acquired in december sap s revenues for fiscal were approximately million as compared to approximately million in fiscal foreign currency translation rates had the effect of increasing fiscal revenues by million from fiscal levels 
seismic equipment sales for fiscal were million as compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
cost of sales for the fiscal years ended january   and was million  million and million  respectively 
gross margins on equipment sales were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
additionally  during fiscal we conducted a company wide physical inventory of our lease pool assets 
as a result  we recorded a charge in the approximate amount of  related to missing equipment that had remaining net book value 
this charge was recorded as a component of cost of goods sold for the year 
gross margins on equipment sales will vary significantly between periods due to the mix of sales revenue between new seismic equipment versus sales of depreciated seismic equipment being sold from our lease pool 
costs and expenses depreciation expense for fiscal amounted to million  which was million  or  lower than fiscal for fiscal  depreciation expense was million  which was million  or  lower than fiscal depreciation expense 
during fiscal  we recorded depreciation expense in the amount of million 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of increasing fiscal depreciation expense by approximately million 
for fiscal  foreign currency translation rates had the effect of increasing depreciation expense by million from the fiscal amount 
the decrease in depreciation expense for the past three fiscal years was largely because certain equipment reached the end of its depreciable life during each of those years  coupled with the sales of assets with remaining depreciable life 
we recorded direct costs related to seismic leasing for fiscal in the amount of million  which was approximately million lower than fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sublease expenses and repair costs during fiscal direct costs for fiscal were million  which was approximately million greater than fiscal direct costs 
the increase was largely attributable to an increase in sublease expenses of  for fiscal  direct costs totaled million  representing a decrease of million from the fiscal amount of million 
this decrease was attributable to the significant decrease in leasing activity during the 
table of contents fiscal year 
specifically  the decrease was mainly attributable to decreases in freight  equipment repairs and sublease expenses of   and  respectively 
direct costs typically fluctuate with leasing revenues  as the three main components of direct costs are freight  equipment repairs and sublease expense 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled million  or million greater than fiscal expenses of million 
during fiscal  we incurred one time severance related charges of approximately million related to the resignation of our former chief financial officer 
of this amount  million was recorded as a non cash stock based compensation expense 
additionally  during the year we incurred approximately million in non recurring professional fees related to the internal investigation of the company s internal controls that was conducted by the company earlier in the year 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in travel  customer relations  investor relations  insurance  compensation expenses  rent and utilities and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled million  or million greater than fiscal expenses of million 
this increase was due to the inclusion of the results of operations of sap for a full year  which had general and administrative expenses totaling million greater than the prior year 
for the fiscal year ended january   our general and administrative expenses totaled million  or million above those of fiscal  which was entirely attributable to the inclusion of sap 
during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts in the amount of  and  respectively  compared to a non cash net benefit for doubtful accounts in the amount of million recorded in fiscal of this net benefit  approximately million represents recoveries of receivables written off in the prior fiscal year 
the recovery was in the form of seismic equipment that we accepted as a settlement of trade receivables owed us by a former customer  who ceased operations that year 
the remaining million benefit resulted from our collecting an outstanding note receivable that had been fully reserved in prior fiscal years due to the uncertainty of collection 
once the funds were collected  we reduced our allowance for doubtful accounts and recorded the net benefit 
at january  and  we had past due trade accounts and note receivables in the approximate amount of million and million  respectively 
as of january  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable amounted to million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million against assets held for sale as a result of our decision to sell the operating assets of dsi 
no such charge was recorded in fiscal or for fiscal  we recorded estimated income tax expense in the amount of million  compared to no income tax expense in fiscal and a net tax benefit of approximately million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of january   we had net working capital of approximately million as compared to net working capital of million at january  historically  our principal liquidity requirements and uses of cash have been for capital expenditures and working capital 
our principal sources of cash have been cash flows from operations and proceeds from sales of lease pool equipment 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended january  was million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended january  was million  compared to net cash used in financing activities for the year ended january  of million and net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal year capital expenditures for the fiscal year totaled approximately million as compared to capital expenditures of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our capital expenditures during the past three fiscal years were made to fulfill specific lease contracts 
during fiscal  we fulfilled our million sercel purchase commitment in its entirety 
at january   we had trade accounts and notes receivable of million that were more than days past due 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million  which management believes is sufficient to cover any losses in our trade accounts receivable and notes receivable 
during fiscal  we acquired seismic equipment in exchange for cancellation of certain accounts receivable due from three customers in the approximate amount of million 
in certain instances when customers have been unable to repay their open accounts receivable balances  we have 
table of contents agreed to a structured repayment program using an interest bearing promissory note 
in these cases  we provide a reserve for doubtful accounts against the balance 
due to the uncertainty of collection  we do not recognize the interest earned until the entire principal balance has been collected 
in most cases where we have a chronic collection problem with a particular customer  future business is done on a prepayment basis or if additional credit is extended  revenues are not recognized until collected 
although the extension of repayment terms on open accounts receivables temporarily reduces our cash flow from operations  we believe that this practice is necessary in light of seismic industry conditions and that it has not adversely affected our ability to conduct routine business 
during fiscal  we issued a note receivable in the approximate amount of million related to open accounts receivable balances for one customer 
the note bears interest at the rate of per annum and provides for eight monthly payments of approximately  additionally  we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally less than one year in duration 
unless there is a question as to whether an account is collectible  the sales revenue and cost of goods sold is recognized upon agreement of terms and delivery has occurred 
in february  we obtained an million term loan with first victoria national bank  the remaining principal balance of which was approximately million at january  the loan is payable in forty eight equal installments of  and bears interest at the rate of prime plus 
the loan is secured by lease pool equipment and all proceeds from lease pool equipment leases and sales 
we paid for our million in capital expenditures during fiscal  using million in cash and entering into separate short term note agreements with three seismic equipment manufacturers related to the purchase of equipment for our lease pool 
the aggregate amount financed by the manufacturers was million  all of which has been repaid as of january  the notes provided for monthly payments aggregating approximately  and bore interest ranging from to 
all three notes had month repayment terms and matured during fiscal on march   we obtained a million revolving loan agreement and credit line with first victoria national bank 
the line allows us to borrow funds to purchase equipment and is secured by the equipment purchased and any leases on that equipment 
interest is payable monthly at prime plus 
principal is due on each note after six months  after nine months and the remaining after a year from the date of each note 
the last date that advances can be made is june  we have not borrowed any funds available under this line 
although we have sufficient cash to meet known commitments and no current plans to draw down any amount  this credit line gives us the financial flexibility to acquire equipment for resale and for lease  as needed  on short notice to take advantage of strategic opportunities regardless of our cash position at the time 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of  or an average cost of per share 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal or we may incur substantial capital expenditures related to the potential acquisition of seamap s three subsidiaries and the contemplated expansion into other international markets 
at the present time  we believe that cash on hand and cash provided by future operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital and liquidity needs over the next months 
however  should demand warrant  we may pursue additional borrowings to fund capital expenditures

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and useful lives of our lease pool assets and their valuation 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations and require management s subjective judgment 
below is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition leases we recognize lease revenue ratably over the term of the lease until there is a question as to whether it is collectible 
commission income is recognized once it has been paid to us 
we do not enter into leases with embedded maintenance obligations 
under our standard lease  the lessee is responsible for maintenance and repairs to the equipment  excluding normal wear and tear 
we provide technical advice to our customers as part of our customer service practices 
equipment sales we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold from the equipment sales upon agreement of terms and when delivery has occurred  unless there is a question as to its collectibility 
we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally less than one year in duration 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts periodically  as conditions warrant  based on whether such receivables are collectible 
in certain instances when customers have been unable to repay their open accounts receivable balances  we have agreed to a structured repayment program using an interest bearing promissory note 
in these cases  we provide a reserve for doubtful accounts against the balance and do not recognize interest earned until the entire principal balance has been collected 
long lived assets we carry property and equipment at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  and compute depreciation on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment  which range from three to seven years 
buildings are depreciated over years  property improvements are amortized over years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of useful life or the life of the leases 
we review our long lived assets for impairment at each reporting date 
if our assessment of the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the fair market value in accordance with the applicable accounting regulations  we record an impairment charge 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the sale of dsi s operating assets 
income taxes we account for our taxes under the liability method  whereby we recognize  on a current and long term basis  deferred tax assets and liabilities which represent differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of our assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established when uncertainty exists as to the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets 
as of january  and  we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million and million  respectively 
as we believe it is not assured that these net deferred tax assets will be realized  we have provided valuation allowances of million and million at january  and  respectively 
we periodically reevaluate these estimates and assumptions as circumstances change 
such factors may significantly impact our results of operations from period to period 

table of contents new accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  revised share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation as amended sfas  and requires entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
sfas r covers various share based compensation arrangement rights and employee share purchase plans 
sfas r eliminates the ability to use the intrinsic value methods of accounting for share options  as provided in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we have not entered  or intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk we operate internationally  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent that transactions are not denominated in us dollars 
we do not currently hold or issue forward exchange contract or other derivative instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
a foreign exchange contract is an arrangement to exchange different currencies at a given date and at a specified rate 
foreign exchange gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the us dollar against foreign currencies and are included in other income in the statements of operations 
we recognized foreign exchange losses in countries where the usd weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency and in countries where the usd strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency 
we recognized foreign exchange gains in countries where the usd strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency and in countries where the usd weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency 
our financial results may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our consolidated balance sheet at january  reflected approximately million of net working capital related to our foreign subsidiaries 
a majority of our foreign net working capital is within canada and australia 
the subsidiaries in those countries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in canadian and australian dollars  respectively 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in canadian and australian dollars  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
a weakened us dollar and its impact on foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing consolidated revenues during the year ended january  by million over the prior year
