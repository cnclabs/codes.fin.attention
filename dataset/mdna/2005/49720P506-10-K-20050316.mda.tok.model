item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated financial data includes our consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we are an innovative provider of software that enable nonprofit organizations to use the internet to increase donations  reduce fundraising costs  improve operations and build awareness and affinity for their causes by bringing employees  volunteers and donors together in online  interactive communities 
our flagship product  kintera sphere  is managed as a single system and offered to nonprofit organizations as a service accessed with a web browser 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in february and launched our service in the first quarter of nonprofit organizations pay kintera service fees for access to kintera sphere and transaction based fees tied to the donations and purchases 
since inception  we have significantly increased our revenues through a combination of factors  including i obtaining new customers  ii expanding existing customer relationships  iii acquiring complementary businesses  iv expanding the features of kintera sphere  v increasing the number and amount of donations we process that result in transaction based fees and vi offering new and improved products and services 
although our revenues have increased substantially in recent periods  we have experienced significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations in each fiscal period since inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have derived the majority of our historical revenues from fees paid by nonprofit organizations related to their use of kintera sphere  and we anticipate that fees related to kintera sphere will account for the majority of our revenues in future periods 
the fees we receive for kintera sphere include upfront and monthly service fees that nonprofit organizations pay for access to kintera sphere as well as transaction based fees tied to donations and purchases we process 
we also generate revenues from our services offerings for wealth profiling and screening  advocacy campaigns and directed giving as well as from licenses of our accounting software 
we derive a significant amount of our kintera sphere revenues from upfront service fees  which are deferred and recognized as revenue over the entire term of our contracts 
conversely  we recognize the operating 
table of contents expenses associated with generation of revenues from upfront service fees as they are incurred 
our operating expenses continue to increase as we expand our selling and marketing efforts and administrative infrastructure to support increased sales that we will recognize as revenue in subsequent periods 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to grow in the near term 
as a result  because of the deferral of recognition of a portion of our revenues  our revenues and operating results will not increase at the same rate as our operating expenses incurred to support revenue recognized in future periods 
our wealth profiling business provides a prospect screening tool designed for the fundraising community to find  profile  monitor  and dynamically rank the wealth in a nonprofit organization s prospect database 
we recognize revenues from the wealth profiling business from primarily three sources software licensing  post consumer support services of the software licenses  and consulting services and related data processing fees 
our awareness campaign business specializes in melding offline and online strategies and tools to build membership  affinity and impact for nonprofit organizations  political campaigns and unions 
we recognize revenue from the awareness campaign business from primarily five sources software licensing  website development and customization  messaging services email fax  and consulting services 
through our fundware business  we derive revenue from license fees for the fundware accounting software package  as well as related product support  professional services  outsourced payroll services and transaction fees 
we currently market kintera sphere and our other products and services through a direct sales force that includes personnel located in our corporate headquarters and throughout the united states 
we also market and sell our fundware products and services through a value added reseller network 
as of december   we have over  nonprofit customer accounts 
our customers include health organizations  educational institutions  religious institutions  professional associations  political organizations  civic organizations and other charities  at both a local and national level 
a small group of nonprofit organizations in each fiscal period may account for a large portion of our revenues 
the significance of a particular customer or group of customers in a given period will depend on the nature and size of their fundraising events in that period as well as the scope of their use of kintera sphere 
to continue our revenue growth  we must both obtain new customers and expand our existing customer relationships through usage of kintera sphere

cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses of operations and database support personnel  depreciation allocations and communications charges associated with the delivery of our software as a service 
our operating expenses are classified into four categories sales and marketing  product development and support  general and administrative and stock based compensation 
we allocate the costs of overhead and facilities to each of the functional areas that use the overhead and facilities services based on their headcount 
these allocated charges include facilities rent for corporate offices  communication charges and depreciation expenses for office furniture and equipment 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  benefits and related expenses of personnel engaged in selling  marketing and customer support functions as well as public relations  advertising and promotional costs 
as we expand our sales and marketing force  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase significantly due to new personnel expenses in 
table of contents product development and support expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and related expenses for engineers  developers and quality assurance personnel as well as facilities and depreciation allocation 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to product development and support such that these expenses will increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for our executive  accounting  and administrative personnel  third party professional service fees and allocated facilities and depreciation expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future  reflecting growth in our operations  increased expenses associated with being a public company and other factors 
we had employees as of december  and intend to hire a significant number of employees in the future 
this expansion will likely place significant demands on our management and operational resources 
to manage rapid growth and increased customer demand for our service  we must continue to invest in and implement additional operational systems  procedures and controls 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  income taxes  commitments and accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment revenue recognition  accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for software development costs  accounting for stock based compensation  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from fees paid by nonprofit organizations related to their use of kintera sphere as well as from our services offerings for wealth profiling and screening  advocacy campaigns and directed giving  from licenses of our prepackaged accounting software and from multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenues to each element of the transaction based upon its fair value 
fair value for all elements of an arrangement is determined when the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items exists based on the price of regular sales on a stand alone basis  and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control 
items are considered to have stand alone value if we have sold that item separately on a regular basis in the past 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been 
table of contents established or we are unable to establish stand alone value  as currently is the case for the upfront payments for activation  maintenance  and use of kintera sphere  the revenues for the elements are recognized on a straight line basis over the entire term of the contract 
to date  our arrangements that contain multiple elements have been contracts that include upfront payments for activation  monthly fees for the maintenance and use of our software and transaction fees tied to the donations and purchases that we process 
revenue associated with the upfront payments is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the entire term of the contract which in general range from twelve to thirty six months 
revenue related to monthly maintenance and transaction fees for donations made through the website are recognized as services are provided 
credit card fees directly associated with processing customer donations and billed to customers are excluded from revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf consensus on issue no 
reporting revenue gross as a principal verses net as an agent 
we receive revenues related to kintera sphere for upfront fees  monthly maintenance fees and transaction fees tied to the donations and purchases that we process 
we recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists upon contract signing or receipt of an authorized purchase order from the customer  delivery has occurred upon performance of services in accordance with contract specifications  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties credit terms extending beyond twelve months or significantly longer than is customary are deemed not to be fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured there are no indicators of non payment based upon history with the customer and or upon completion of credit procedures  if completed 
billings made or payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period these services are provided 
we recognize revenues from wealth profiling and screening services from primarily three sources software licensing  post consumer support services of the software licenses  and consulting services and related data processing fees 
revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred at the customer s location  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vsoe of fair value is based on the normal pricing practices for those products and services when sold separately and customer renewal rates for post contract customer support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we recognize revenue from our advocacy campaign services from primarily five sources software licensing  website development and customization  messaging services email fax  and consulting services 
revenue is recognized in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition 
software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  fees from the arrangement are fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vsoe of fair value is based on the normal pricing practices for those products and services when sold separately and customer renewal rates for post contract customer support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we recognize revenue from licenses of our fundware software products and related services in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop for other offerings  we follow staff 
table of contents accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped or the service has been performed or  in the case of certain agreements  when the products are delivered to resellers  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we offer technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plan 
other revenue in the fundware business consists primarily of revenue from revenue sharing arrangements with third party service providers and from online advertising agreements 
transaction fees are recognized from revenue sharing arrangements as end user sales are reported to us by these partners 
revenue from online advertising agreements is recognized as the lesser of when the advertisements are published or pro rata based on the contractual time period 
for arrangements where undelivered services are essential to the functionality of delivered software  we recognize both the product license revenues and service revenues under the percentage of completion contract method in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
to date  license and service revenues recognized pursuant to sop have not been significant 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s product  we account for cash consideration such as sales incentives that is given to customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that can be identified and for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated 
software licenses are sold together with consulting services in our wealth profiling  advocacy campaign businesses and fundware software products 
when this occurs  license fees are recognized upon delivery provided that the revenue recognition criteria discussed above are met 
the more significant factors considered in determining whether revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of the services ie  consideration as to whether services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the recognition of the software license fee 
payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services do not provide significant customization or modification of the software products and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was delivered 
for arrangements with services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and related service revenues are recognized upon completion of the delivery of the license and the services with the residual method utilized for the remaining elements in the contract 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes due 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not probable  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
revenues from post contract customer support services  such as software maintenance  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support period 
the majority of software maintenance agreements provide technical support as well as unspecified software product upgrades and releases when and if made available during the term of the support period 
advertising barter transactions are recorded at the lesser of estimated fair value of the advertising received or given in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for barter transactions 
revenue from barter transactions is recognized when advertising is provided  and services received are charged to expense when used 
revenues for non advertising barter transactions are recognized at the estimated fair value when the advertising spots received under such contracts are either used or sold to third parties 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
acquisitions which cause us to recognize goodwill and other intangible assets require us to make determinations about the value and recoverability of those assets that involve estimates and judgments 
we have made several acquisitions of businesses and assets that resulted in both goodwill and intangible assets being recorded in our financial statements 
we have typically paid most of 
table of contents the acquisition prices in these transactions through the issuance of equity securities 
the value of the equity securities prior to our initial public offering in december was determined through comparison to the issuance prices received in private placement transactions 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets  including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
we also assess the impairment of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment charge is recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
an impairment charge would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset being evaluated for impairment 
any resulting impairment charge could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for software development costs 
we account for internal use software development costs in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
in accordance with sop  costs to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage are capitalized 
internal use capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software applications of up to three years and are included in depreciation and amortization 
it is possible that estimated total product revenues  the estimated economic life of the product  or both  will be reduced in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of capitalized software costs may be reduced in the future  which could cause our operating results in future periods to be adversely affected 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized  and  in internally developed internal use software  respectively 
we account for the development cost of software that is marketed to customers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
sfas requires product development costs to be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is attained 
technological feasibility is attained when software has completed a detail program design for its intended use 
capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software applications of up to three years and are included in depreciation and amortization 
it is possible that estimated total product revenues  the estimated economic life of the product  or both  will be reduced in the future 
as a result  the carrying amount of capitalized software costs may be reduced in the future  which could cause our operating results in future periods to be adversely affected 
we periodically review the software that has been capitalized for impairment 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized  and  in internally developed software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  respectively 
accounting for deferred stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million in deferred stock based compensation within stockholders equity  respectively 
these options were considered compensatory 
table of contents because the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock for financial reporting purposes was greater than the exercise prices determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value prior to the company s initial public offering of the underlying shares of common stock involves subjective judgment and the consideration of a variety of factors  including the prices obtained in private placement transactions of other equity securities  and as a result the amount of the compensatory charge is not based on an objective measure such as the trading price of the common stock since there was no public market for our common stock prior to december  as of december   we had an aggregate of million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized 
this deferred compensation balance will be amortized as follows million in  million in  and million in we are amortizing the deferred compensation on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four years 
the amount of stock based compensation amortization actually recognized in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued but unvested deferred compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  and  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and research and development tax credits  before they expire 
as a result  we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december  results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenue 
revenue increased from million for to million for  which includes million in revenue from a related party 
revenue increased to million for the revenues for the periods broke down as follows for the twelve months ended december  transaction and data processing fees monthly service fees amortization of upfront fees other total the increase of million in revenue from to was due to a number of factors  including an increase in transaction based fees approximately million from an increase in the number of events and data records screened from both new and existing customers  increased monthly maintenance approximately million from both new and existing customers  increased amortization of upfront fees approximately million  and other million 
the increase in revenue from to was due to a number of factors  including an increase in transaction based fees approximately million from an increase in the number of events from both new and existing customers  increased monthly maintenance million  including approximately million in maintenance fees associated with the acquisition of ho networks  inc  amortization of upfront fees approximately million  and increased masterplanner revenue of approximately million due primarily to the expansion into the san diego market 

table of contents revenue from a related party totaled million for the year ended december  this revenue was from a single customer and was classified as related party revenue as the executive management of the customer is a family relative of an executive officer of kintera 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased from million in to million in to million in during  these increases were due primarily to the addition of personnel in the area of operations and database management to support customer growth 
in  these increases were due primarily to expenses incurred in connection with servicing customer and revenue growth 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase was due primarily to the expansion of our sales force and customer support staff approximately million in and million in and increased commission expenses due to higher revenue levels approximately million in and million in 
product development and support 
product development and support expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in these increases were primarily due to expenses related to increased headcount to support the development efforts for enhancements to kintera sphere features and integration of new technologies 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in these increases were due primarily to increased staffing  and costs associated with being a public company including  but not limited to  compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations principally through sales of equity securities 
in december  we completed our initial public offering and received net proceeds of million  including million from the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
in july  we sold  shares of our common stock in a private placement at a price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
we completed another private placement in december and sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
at december  and  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  primarily to fund operating losses 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of purchases of marketable securities approximately million  purchases of property and equipment approximately million  acquisition costs related to the acquisition of fundware approximately million  other acquisition costs million  additions to developed software approximately million and was partially offset by sales of marketable securities and other assets million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the maturity of marketable securities approximately million partially offset by purchases of property and equipment approximately million and purchases of marketable securities approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  total capital expenditures were million for the year ended december  these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of computers and other equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily from the sale of common stock to 
table of contents institutional investors in private placements in july and december of net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from our initial public offering approximately million  net of offering costs and net proceeds from the sale of preferred stock approximately million 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and contractual commitments for at least the next months 
if we are unable to increase our revenues  we will need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs 
we may need additional financing earlier than we anticipate 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock 
we may also decide to issue securities  including debt securities  which have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our future needs 
this may prevent us from increasing our market share  capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry 
we currently do not believe that we have invested in any variable interest entities 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total payments due by period less than year years years more than years operating leases other total recent accounting requirements in december  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this standard requires expensing of stock options and other share based payments and supersedes sfas no 
 which had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing proforma disclosure only 
this standard is effective for the company as of july  and will apply to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date as well as the unvested portion of prior awards 
we will adopt the standard as of the effective date and it is expected to have a material effect on the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
