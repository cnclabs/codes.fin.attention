item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item business executive summary harvest natural resources  inc is an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  development  production and disposition of oil and gas properties since  when it was incorporated under delaware law 
over our history  we have acquired and developed significant interests in the bolivarian republic of venezuela venezuela and the russian federation russia and have undeveloped acreage offshore china 
currently  our producing operations are conducted through our percent owned venezuelan subsidiary  harvest vinccler  ca harvest vinccler  formerly benton vinccler  ca  which operates the south monagas unit in venezuela 
in september  we announced the redemption on november  of all million of our percent senior unsecured notes due november  the notes 
in august and september  we purchased west texas intermediate wti crude oil puts covering  barrels of oil per day for calendar year to protect our cash flow 
these puts cost a total of million  have an average strike price of per barrel and  due to our pricing structure for our venezuelan oil  have the economic effect of hedging approximately  barrels of oil per day 
during  we drilled ten new wells and re entered and completed an additional six wells in the south monagas unit 
our daily crude oil and natural gas sales on december   were  barrels of oil and million cubic feet of gas 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations for a complete description of these and other events during as of december   we had total estimated proved reserves in the south monagas unit  net of minority interest  of million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe  and a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow  before income taxes  for total proved reserves of million 
as of december   we had total assets of million 
we had cash in the amount of million and no long term debt 
we had total revenues of million and net cash provided by operating activities of million 
for the year ended december   we had cash in the amount of million and million in long term debt 
we had total revenues of million and net cash provided by operating activities of million 

table of contents our business strategy is to identify  acquire  develop and produce large discovered oil and gas fields in venezuela and russia 
we have more than twelve years of experience in venezuela and russia  and have established organizations in both countries 
we seek additional opportunities in these two countries and would consider investments in other countries that meet our criteria 
in executing our business strategy  we will strive to sustain the current balance sheet strength through maintaining financial prudence and rigorous investment criteria  maximizing cash flows from existing operations in order to invest in new opportunities  using our experience  skills and cash on hand to acquire new projects  and keeping our organizational capabilities in line with our rate of growth 
in venezuela  we seek to deliver maximum operating cash flow through the efficient management of our capital expenditure programs and cost structure 
the year represented our first full year of natural gas production  which allowed us to diversify our revenues and cash flow 
our venezuelan producing properties generate net cash from operating activities in excess of projected capital expenditures 
we have significant financial flexibility and substantial cash flow supported by current oil prices and current production levels for both oil and gas 
we believe this provides us with the ability to pursue growth opportunities while at the same time maintaining a strong balance sheet 
however  we have recently experienced difficulties in venezuela with getting our budgets approved and obtaining permits from the ministry of energy and petroleum mep  formerly ministry of energy and mines and ministry of environment  as required  which are critical to our ability to fully execute our drilling program 
a continuation of these difficulties or a curtailment of production in venezuela could adversely affect our production and our ability to pursue growth opportunities 
while we cannot predict the degree to which we will be successful  we continue to evaluate properties in both venezuela and russia to find opportunities which meet our focused acquisition criteria 
we expect our cash generating capacity to be supported by our new gas production  lower operating expenses and our expected future uracoa and bombal drilling programs 
our ability to successfully execute our strategy is subject to significant risks including  among other things  operating risks  political risks  legal risks and financial risks

table of contents south monagas unit  venezuela harvest vinccler general in july  we and venezolana de inversiones y construcciones clerico  ca  a venezuelan construction and engineering company vinccler  signed a year operating service agreement with lagoven  sa  an affiliate of pdvsa  to reactivate and further develop the uracoa  tucupita and bombal fields 
these fields comprise the south monagas unit 
we were the first us company since to be granted such an oil field development contract in venezuela 
the oil and natural gas operations in the south monagas unit are conducted by harvest vinccler  our percent owned subsidiary 
the remaining percent of the outstanding capital stock of harvest vinccler is owned by vinccler 
through our majority ownership of stock in harvest vinccler  we make all operational and corporate decisions related to harvest vinccler  subject to certain super majority provisions of harvest vinccler s charter documents related to mergers  consolidations  sales of substantially all of its corporate assets  change of business  and similar major corporate events 
vinccler has an extensive operating history in venezuela 
it provided harvest vinccler with initial financial assistance and significant construction services 
vinccler provided assistance with construction projects  governmental relations and labor relations during and under the terms of the operating service agreement  harvest vinccler is a contractor for pdvsa 
harvest vinccler is responsible for overall operations of the south monagas unit  including all necessary investments to reactivate and develop the fields comprising the south monagas unit 
the venezuelan government maintains full ownership of all hydrocarbons in the fields 
in addition  pdvsa maintains full ownership of equipment and capital infrastructure following its installation 
the operating service agreement provides for harvest vinccler to receive an operating fee for each barrel of crude oil delivered 
it also provides harvest vinccler with the right to receive a capital recovery fee for certain of its capital expenditures  provided that such operating fee and capital recovery fee cannot exceed the maximum total fee per barrel set forth in the agreement 
the operating fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the special energy index of the us consumer price index 
the maximum total fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the average of certain world crude oil prices 
since  the maximum total fee received by harvest vinccler has approximated percent of west texas intermediate crude oil wti price 
in september  harvest vinccler and pdvsa signed an amendment to the operating service agreement  providing for the delivery of up to bcf of natural gas through july at a price of per mcf 
for  natural gas sales averaged million cubic feet mmcf per day 
in addition  harvest vinccler agreed to sell to pdvsa million barrels of oil stipulated as additional volumes resulting from the gas production incremental crude oil 
incremental crude oil is sold at a price of per barrel with the quarterly volume of such sales based on quarterly natural gas sales multiplied by the ratio of mmbbls to bcf 
at the end of each quarter  harvest vinccler prepares an invoice to pdvsa based on barrels of oil accepted by pdvsa during the quarter  using quarterly adjusted contract service fees per barrel 
at the end of each quarter  harvest vinccler also prepares invoices for natural gas sales and incremental crude oil 
payment is due under the invoices by the end of the second month after the end of the quarter 
invoice amounts and payments are denominated in us dollars 
payments are wire transferred into harvest vinccler s account in a commercial bank in the united states 

table of contents harvest vinccler has constructed a mile oil pipeline from its oil processing facilities at uracoa to pdvsa s storage facility  the custody transfer point 
the operating service agreement specifies that the oil stream may contain no more than one percent base sediment and one percent water 
quality measurements are conducted both at harvest vinccler s facilities and at pdvsa s storage facility 
in  we built and completed a mile pipeline with a normal capacity of mmcf of natural gas per day and a design capacity of mmcf of natural gas per day  a gas gathering system  upgrades to the um plant facilities and new gas treatment and compression facilities 
harvest vinccler borrowed million under a project loan for the gas pipeline and related facilities and the remainder of the project costs were funded from existing cash balances and internally generated cash flow 
the operating service agreement contains requirements for the measurement and quality of the natural gas delivered to pdvsa 
in august  harvest vinccler sold its power generation facility located in the uracoa and tucupita fields 
concurrently with the sale  harvest vinccler entered into a long term power purchase agreement with the purchaser of the facility to provide for the electrical needs of the field throughout the remaining term of the operating service agreement 
harvest vinccler has entered into long term agreements for the leasing of compression and the operation and maintenance of the gas treatment and compression facilities 
risk factors currently  the production from the south monagas unit represents all of our production 
this production may be reduced by actions of the venezuelan government 
in addition  political uncertainty in venezuela increases our exposure to production disruptions and project execution risk 
these risk factors and other risk factors are discussed in item  risk factors 
location and geology the south monagas unit extends across the southeastern part of the state of monagas and the southwestern part of the state of delta amacuro in eastern venezuela 
the south monagas unit is approximately miles long and eight miles wide and consists of  acres  of which the fields comprise approximately one half of the acreage 
at december   proved reserves attributable to our venezuelan operations were mboe mboe net to harvest 
this represented percent of our proved reserves at year end 
harvest vinccler has been primarily developing the oficina sands in the uracoa field 
the uracoa field contains percent of the south monagas unit s proved reserves 
drilling and development activity harvest vinccler drilled ten oil wells and re entered an additional six wells in and had wells on production in all fields at year end in the uracoa field 
uracoa field harvest vinccler has been developing the south monagas unit since  beginning with the uracoa field 
there are currently oil and gas producing wells in the field 
harvest vinccler processes the oil  water and natural gas in the uracoa central processing unit and ships the processed oil via pipeline to the pdvsa custody transfer point 
harvest vinccler treats and filters produced water  then reinjects it into the aquifer to assist the natural water drive 
harvest vinccler had reinjected produced natural gas into the natural gas cap primarily for storage conservation until november  at which time it began selling the natural gas 
the major components of the state of the art process facility were designed in the united states and installed by harvest vinccler 
this process design is commonly used in heavy oil production in the united states  but was not previously used extensively in venezuela to process crude oil of similar gravity or quality 
the current production facility has capacity to handle thousand barrels mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day and injection capacity of mmcf of natural gas per day and storage of up to mbbls of crude oil 
all gas presently being sold by harvest vinccler is produced from the uracoa field 

table of contents tucupita field there are currently oil producing wells and five water injection wells at tucupita 
the current production facility has capacity to handle mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day and storage for up to mbbls of crude oil 
the oil is transported through a mile  mbbl per day capacity oil pipeline constructed in from tucupita to the uracoa plant facilities 
harvest vinccler reinjects produced water from tucupita into the aquifer to aid the natural water drive  and we utilize a portion of the associated natural gas to operate a power generation facility to supply our power needs 
bombal field the east bombal field was drilled in  and the wells were suspended until gas sales could take place 
there are currently four oil producing wells in the west bombal field 
portable separation  pumping and storage for mbbl of crude oil are maintained at the field 
the crude oil is pumped via a pipeline and tied into the mile tucupita oil pipeline to the uracoa plant facilities 
harvest vinccler began engineering and design studies in late with first gas sales expected in gas from this field will be used to supplement gas production from uracoa as production there declines 
customers and market information under the operating service agreement  all oil and natural gas produced is delivered to pdvsa for a fee 
while we have substantial cash reserves  a prolonged loss of sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
employees and community relations harvest vinccler has a highly skilled staff of local employees and two expatriates 
harvest vinccler has invested in a social community program that includes medical programs in ophthalmologic and dental care  as well as additional social investments including the purchase of medicines and medical equipment for local communities within the south monagas unit 
health  safety and environment harvest vinccler s health  safety and environmental policy is an integral part of its business 
harvest vinccler continually improves its policy and practices related to personnel safety  property protection and environmental management 
these improvements can be directly attributed to its efforts in accident prevention programs and the training and implementation of a comprehensive process safety management system 
north gubkinskoye and south tarasovskoye  russia geoilbent in september  we sold our percent minority equity investment in geoilbent to yukos operational holding limited for million plus million for the repayment of intercompany loans and accounts receivable

wab  south china sea benton offshore china company general in december  we acquired crestone energy corporation  subsequently renamed benton offshore china company 
its principal asset is a petroleum contract with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc for the wab area 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for an additional million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is 
table of contents the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with another company 
the territorial dispute has lasted for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
as part of a review of our assets  a third party conducted an evaluation of the wab area 
through that evaluation and our own assessment  we recorded a million impairment charge in the second quarter of no further impairment of the property is currently required 
location and geology the wab contract area is located approximately miles southeast of the dai hung big bear oil field 
the block is adjacent to british petroleum s giant natural gas discovery at lan tay red orchid and miles north of exxon s natuna discovery 
the contract area covers several similar structural trends  each with potential for hydrocarbon reserves in possible multiple pay zones 
drilling and development activity due to the sovereignty issues between china and vietnam  we have been unable to pursue an exploration program during phase one of the contract 
as a result  we have obtained license extensions  with the current extension in effect until may  while no assurance can be given  we believe we will continue to receive license extensions so long as the sovereignty issues persist 
domestic operations we acquired a percent interest in three california state offshore oil and gas leases the california leases and a parcel of onshore property from molino energy company  llc 
in june  we sold our california onshore property  which had a zero carrying value  for net proceeds of million 
we and other parties may be responsible to the state of california for any remediation costs associated with the onshore property and the related offshore oil and gas leases

the following table sets forth information regarding estimates of proved reserves at december   which are all venezuelan 
the information includes reserve information net of a percent deduction for the minority interest in harvest vinccler 
all reserves are attributable to an operating service 
table of contents agreement between harvest vinccler and pdvsa under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
net crude oil and condensate mbbls proved proved developed undeveloped total venezuela net natural gas mmcf proved proved developed undeveloped total venezuela estimates of commercially recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of the future net cash flows derived therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the subject properties  comparison with other producing properties  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  municipal taxes  abandonment costs  development costs  and workover and remedial costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
all such estimates are to some degree speculative and various classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of speculation involved 
for these reasons  estimates of the commercially recoverable reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular property or group of properties  the classification  cost and risk of recovering such reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom  prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially 
the difficulty of making precise estimates is accentuated by the fact that percent of our total proved reserves were undeveloped as of december  the cost to develop the proved undeveloped reserves is expected to be million over the next three years 
reserve estimates are not constrained by the availability of the capital resources required to finance the estimated development and operating expenditures 
in addition  actual future net cash flows will be affected by factors such as actual production  oil and natural gas sales  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  availability and capacity of gathering systems and pipelines  changes in governmental regulations  policies or taxation  and the impact of inflation on costs 
the timing of actual future net oil and natural gas sales from proved reserves as well as the year end price  and thus their actual present value  can be affected by the timing of the incurrence of expenditures in connection with development of oil and gas properties 
the percent discount factor required by the sec to be used to calculate present value for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time  risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry and the political risks associated with operations in venezuela 
discounted present value  regardless of what discount rate is used  is materially affected by assumptions as to the amount and timing of future production  which assumptions may  and often do  prove to be inaccurate 
for the period ending december   we reported  million million net to us of discounted future net cash flows before income taxes from proved reserves based on the sec s required calculations

d geoilbent was sold on september  e arctic gas was sold on april  regulation general our operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate 
in particular  oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by change in governments  civil unrest  price and currency controls  limitations on oil and natural gas production  world demand for crude oil  tax  environmental  safety and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  changes in such laws  changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of such rules and regulations  and changes in contract interpretation and policies of contract adherence 
in any country in which we may do business  the oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation are periodically changed for a variety of political  economic  environmental and other reasons 
numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry  some 
table of contents of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business 
venezuela on february   venezuela imposed currency controls and created the commission for administration of foreign currency with the task of establishing the detailed rules and regulations and generally administering the exchange control regime 
these controls fix the exchange rate between the venezuelan bolivar and the us dollar and restrict the ability to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and vice versa 
initially the exchange rate was set at  venezuelan bolivars for each us dollar 
on february   the official exchange rate was adjusted to  venezuelan bolivars for each us dollar 
oil companies such as harvest vinccler are allowed to receive payments for oil sales in us dollars and pay us dollar denominated expenses from those payments 
we have substantial cash reserves and do not expect the venezuelan currency conversion restriction to adversely affect our ability to meet short term loan obligations and operating requirements for the next twelve months 
venezuela requires environmental and other permits for certain operations conducted in oil field development  such as site construction  drilling and seismic activities 
as a contractor to pdvsa  harvest vinccler submits capital budgets to pdvsa for review  including capital expenditures to comply with venezuelan environmental regulations 
no capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations were required in or harvest vinccler also submits requests for permits for drilling  seismic and operating activities to pdvsa  which then obtains such permits from the mep and ministry of environment  as required 
harvest vinccler is also subject to income  municipal and value added taxes  and must file certain monthly and annual compliance reports with the national tax administration and with various municipalities

we do not directly operate any drilling equipment 

table of contents acreage the following table summarizes the developed and undeveloped acreage that we owned  leased or held under operating service agreement or concession as of december  developed undeveloped gross net gross net venezuela china total competition we encounter substantial competition from major oil and gas companies and independent operators in acquiring properties and leases for the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas 
the principal competitive factors in the acquisition of such oil and gas properties include staff and data necessary to identify  investigate and purchase such properties  the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such properties  and access to local partners and governmental entities 
many of our competitors have influence  financial resources  staffs  data resources and facilities substantially greater than ours 
environmental regulation various federal  state  local and international laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  may affect our operations and costs 
we are committed to the protection of the environment and believe we are in substantial compliance with the applicable laws and regulations 
however  regulatory requirements may  and often do  change and become more stringent  and there can be no assurance that future regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
employees at december   we had full time employees 
harvest vinccler had employees and our moscow office had employees 
we augment our staffs from time to time with independent consultants  as required 
title to developed and undeveloped acreage all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between harvest vinccler and pdvsa  under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
the wab petroleum contract lies within an area which is the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with a third party 
the territorial dispute has existed for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
it is uncertain when or how this dispute will be resolved  and under what terms the various countries and parties to the agreements may participate in the resolution 
item properties in april  we signed a ten year lease for office space in houston  texas  for approximately  per month 
we moved into the new space in august in addition  harvest vinccler leased new office space in maturin and caracas  venezuela for  and  per month  respectively 
we leased  square feet of space in a california building that we no longer occupy under a lease agreement that expired in december we subleased all of the office space in california for rents that approximated our lease costs

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business strategy we intend to continue to identify  acquire and exploit known oil and natural gas fields in our current areas of interest and possibly other areas while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility 
to accomplish this  we intend to seek to deliver more operating cash flow in venezuela  we seek to deliver more operating cash flow through the efficient management of our capital expenditure programs and cost structure 
focus our efforts in areas of low geologic risk we intend to focus our activities principally in areas of large known but undeveloped or under developed oil and gas resources 
seek operational and financial control we desire control of major decisions for development  production  staffing and financing for each project for a period of time sufficient for us to ensure maximum returns on investments 
establish a local presence through joint venture partners and the use of local personnel we seek to establish a local presence in our areas of operation to facilitate stronger relationships with local government and labor 
in addition  using local personnel helps us to take advantage of local knowledge and experience and to minimize costs 
in pursuing new opportunities  we will seek to enter at an early stage and find local partners in an effort to reduce our risk in any one venture 
commit capital in a phased manner to limit total commitments at any one time we are willing to agree to minimum capital expenditure or development commitments at the outset of new projects  but we endeavor to structure such commitments so that we can fulfill them over time under a prudent plan of development  allowing near term operating cash flow to help fund further investment  thereby limiting our 
table of contents maximum cash exposure 
we also seek to maximize available local financing capacity to develop the hydrocarbons and associated infrastructure 
limit exploration activities we do not engage in exploration except in connection with the expansion of an existing reservoir and in that case only where the risks are deemed to be manageable in the context of total cash exposure and probability of success 
maintain a prudent financial plan we intend to maintain our financial flexibility by closely monitoring spending  holding significant cash reserves  actively seeking opportunities to reduce our weighted average cost of capital and increasing our liquidity 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating us 
our only source of production may be reduced by actions of the venezuelan government 
currently  the production from the south monagas unit in venezuela represents all of our production 
our revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected if we are not allowed to produce under our contract crude oil and natural gas at our projected levels 
recent events have increased the likelihood of this event occurring 
under the operating service agreement harvest vinccler submits an annual budget to pdvsa for review and comment 
harvest vinccler submitted to pdvsa its budget which provided for a million drilling and facilities program 
under the terms of the operating service agreement this budget was deemed approved by pdvsa in november however  on december   harvest vinccler received letters from pdvsa seeking to reduce the drilling and facilities budget by over percent and appearing to restrict average crude oil production for to about  barrels a day 
at about the same time  harvest vinccler began to experience delays in the receipt of permits to drill new wells pursuant to its budget 
in accordance with established procedures  harvest vinccler submitted requests to pdvsa to obtain permits from mep for the drilling of eight wells 
only one of those requests was forwarded to the mep 
as a consequence of these delayed drilling permits  harvest vinccler began to run out of approved locations to continue its two rig drilling program 
on january   harvest vinccler formally notified one of its rig contractors that it would not be renewing its drilling contract and placed the rig on standby until january  also  on january   harvest vinccler gave a thirty day termination notice to the other rig company 
on january   we announced that harvest vinccler was suspending its drilling program 
in recent months  harvest vinccler has also experienced some operational interruptions in deliveries to pdvsa  although not of such a magnitude or duration as to affect production 
it has been reported that pdvsa has also sought to cut the budgets between percent and percent of the other active operating service agreements in venezuela 
in addition  rafael ramirez  the president of pdvsa and minister of mep  has stated that pdvsa wants to renegotiate the terms of the operating service agreements as they are too costly  and that five or six of the operating service agreements have serious problems 
it has been reported that one of these agreements is the south monagas unit operating service agreement held by harvest vinccler 
mr 
ramirez has also said that pdvsa will honor its contracts 
collectively  these actions by the venezuelan government and pdvsa create a risk that our production will be reduced 
currently  harvest vinccler s production has not been reduced  but if it is not allowed to conduct its drilling and facilities program  or if that program is restricted  then we will not meet our production forecasts and  over time  existing levels of production and available reserves will decline 
while we believe such actions are not in accord with the operating service agreement  we and harvest vinccler are in discussions with venezuelan officials and pdvsa to determine if these issues can be resolved through a mutually acceptable agreement 
while we are hopeful of achieving a business solution  no assurance can be given that we will succeed or that the situation will not continue for an extended period of time 
while we have substantial cash reserves  a prolonged curtailment of production or a failure or delay by pdvsa to pay our invoices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents political uncertainty in venezuela increases our exposure to production disruptions and project execution risk 
political and economic uncertainty is very high in venezuela 
from december  through february   pdvsa was unable to accept our oil due to the national civil work stoppage in venezuela protesting the government of president chavez 
as a result  harvest vinccler s oil deliveries were reduced by an estimated million barrels and deliveries were reduced by an estimated million barrels 
in response to the national civil work stoppage  the venezuelan government terminated several thousand pdvsa employees 
as a result of the situation in pdvsa  its payment to harvest vinccler for crude oil delivered in the fourth quarter of was late by seven days 
however  since then all other payments have been on time 
following the national work stoppage  president chavez prevailed in a recall referendum 
in addition  pdvsa has been reorganized a number of times  most recently in january the current president of pdvsa is also the minister of mep 
the political situation in venezuela adds to the risk that we will be able to enforce the operating service agreement in venezuela and could lead to further civil unrest and work stoppages that could affect our ability to produce crude oil and natural gas 
in addition  the increasing integration of pdvsa into the governmental structure adds legal and economic uncertainty to our continued operations 
these same risk factors could also affect our ability to acquire new projects in venezuela and the timing of those acquisitions 
acquiring new oil projects in venezuela depends upon our ability to meet the requirements of the organic hydrocarbon law 
new oil projects in venezuela are governed by the organic hydrocarbon law  which requires that such projects be carried out through incorporated joint ventures with majority ownership by governmental entities 
it is our understanding that the mep is still defining the methodology for the application of this law 
while we believe it is possible to comply with this law and at the same time meet our criteria for new projects  no precedents exist and there is a risk we will be unable to achieve the desired result 
our strategy to focus on russia carries deal execution  operating  financial  legal and political risks 
while we believe our established presence in russia and our experience and skills from prior operations position us well for future projects  doing business in russia also carries unique risks 
the operating environment is often difficult and the ability to operate successfully will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to control the pace of development  our ability to apply best practices in drilling and development  and the fostering of relationships with russian partners  the local community and governmental authorities 
financial risks include our ability to control costs and attract financing for russian projects 
in addition  the russian legal system is not mature and its reliability is uncertain 
this may affect our ability to enforce contracts and achieve certainty in our rights to develop and operate oil and gas projects  as well as our ability to obtain adequate compensation for any resulting losses 
our strategy in russia depends on our ability to have operational and financial control 
recently  the russian government has restricted certain strategic projects in russia to majority owned russia companies 
such a policy  if widely applied  could adversely affect our ability to acquire projects in russia consistent with our strategy 
operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations  and our strategy to primarily focus on venezuela and russia limits our country risk diversification 
our operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  nationalization  war  insurrection  civil unrest  strikes and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  being subject to foreign laws  legal systems and the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or tribunals  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign policy  foreign trade  taxation and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the united states 
our strategy to focus on venezuela and russia concentrates our foreign operations risk and increases the potential impact to us of the operating  financial and political risks in those countries 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our strategy 
we are a small organization and depend on the skills and experience of a few individuals in key management and operating positions to execute our business strategy 
loss of one or more key individuals in the organization could hamper or delay achieving our strategy 

table of contents the total capital required for development of new fields may exceed our ability to finance 
our future capital requirements for new projects may exceed the cash available from existing free cash flow and cash on hand 
our ability to acquire financing is uncertain and may be affected by numerous factors beyond our control  including the risks associated with our sole operations in venezuela 
because of the financial risk factors in the countries in which we operate  we may not be able to secure either the equity or debt financing necessary to meet any future cash needs for investment  which may limit our ability to fully develop new projects  cause delays with their development or require early divestment of all or a portion of those projects 
our current and future revenue is subject to concentrated counter party risk 
our current operations in venezuela rely on production fee payments from pdvsa for all revenue receipts 
we do not own the hydrocarbons and do not sell oil and gas in open markets 
future projects in venezuela  russia and other countries may involve similar production fee payments from a limited number of companies or governments 
our foreign operations expose us to foreign currency risk 
presently  our only operations are located in venezuela 
venezuela continues to be considered a highly inflationary economy 
results of operations in that country are measured in us dollars with all currency gains or losses recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
there are many factors which affect foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our influence 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan bolivar to the us dollar 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates 
our venezuelan receipts are denominated in us dollars  and most expenditures are in us dollars as well 
for a discussion of currency controls in venezuela  see capital resources and liquidity below 
successful acquisition of projects in russia may also expose us to foreign currency risk in that country 
oil price declines and volatility could adversely affect our revenue  cash flows and profitability 
prices for oil fluctuate widely 
the average price we received for oil in venezuela increased to per bbl for the year ended december   compared with per bbl for the year ended december  in november  we began selling natural gas in venezuela under an addendum to our operating service contract at per mcf and incremental crude oil at per bbl 
while this diversifies our revenue stream  revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to service our debt 
in addition  we may have ceiling test write downs when prices decline 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil that we can produce economically and lower oil production could affect the amount of natural gas we can produce 
we cannot predict future oil prices 
factors that can cause this fluctuation include relatively minor changes in the global supply and demand for oil  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and policies  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  and overall economic conditions 
lower oil and natural gas prices or downward adjustments to our reserves may cause us to record ceiling limitation write downs 
we use the full cost method of accounting to report our oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
the estimated future net cash flows include the impact of effective hedging activity as applicable 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce stockholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
we did not incur ceiling test write downs in in the consolidated financial statements of the wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
equity in net losses of affiliated companies 
table of contents includes a million our share ceiling test write down recorded by geoilbent during their fiscal year ended september  estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this form k contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
see our only source of production may be reduced by actions of the venezuelan government 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
such process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices  ability to deliver under the terms of our operating service agreement  approval of capital budgets and permits from pdvsa and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
actual production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used 
such variances may be material 
at december   approximately percent of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
undeveloped reserves  by their nature  are less certain than developed reserves 
the estimated future development cost increased by over million to develop the undeveloped reserves 
the estimates of our future reserves include the assumption that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop these reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
see supplemental information on oil and natural gas producing activities 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in demand  our ability to produce or in governmental regulations  policies or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the percent discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and our risks or the risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the percent discount factor 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
in general  production rates and remaining reserves from oil and gas properties decline as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
our reserves in the south monagas unit in venezuela will decline as they are produced unless we acquire additional properties in venezuela  russia or elsewhere with proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
our future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is 
table of contents often uncertain 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions  shortages in experienced labor  delays in receiving necessary governmental permits  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment  and delays in receipt of permits or access to lands 
the prevailing price of oil also affects the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
the oil and natural gas industry experiences numerous operating risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pump and pipe failures  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
competition within the industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various foreign governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated may include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and gas production 
in order to conserve or limit supplies of oil and natural gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
results of operations we include the results of operations of harvest vinccler in our consolidated financial statements and reflect the percent ownership interest of vinccler as a minority interest 
we accounted for our investments in geoilbent and arctic gas using the equity method 
we included geoilbent and arctic gas in our consolidated financial statements based on a fiscal year ending september our results of operations for the years ended december  and reflect the results of geoilbent until sold on september  and arctic gas until sold on april  for the twelve months ended september  you should read the following discussion of the results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and the financial condition as of december  and in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 

table of contents we have presented selected expense items from our consolidated income statement as a percentage of revenue in the following table years ended december  operating expenses depletion  depreciation and amortization general and administrative taxes other than on income interest years ended december  and net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share for our results of operations for primarily reflected the results for harvest vinccler in venezuela  which accounted for all of our production and oil and gas sales revenue 
oil revenue per barrel increased percent from in to in and oil sales quantities increased percent from mbbls of oil in to mbbls of oil in during compared with natural gas sales quantities for from venezuela were bcf 
revenue for includes mbbls of oil at a fixed price associated with the gas sales contract 
our revenues increased million  or percent  during compared with this was due to the addition of a full year of natural gas sales million  higher oil volumes million and higher crude oil prices million 
our sales quantities for from venezuela were mboe compared with mboe in the increase in sales quantities of mboe  or percent  was due to a full year of natural gas production 
crude oil volumes for were also higher as was affected by the shut in of the production in venezuela from december to february due to the national work stoppage 
our operating expenses increased million  or percent  for compared with this was primarily due to higher production volumes  higher workover and maintenance programs and increased insurance costs 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased million  or percent  during compared with due to increased oil and gas production from venezuela 
depletion expense per barrel of oil produced from venezuela during was compared with during the increase was primarily due to increased future development costs 
we recognized write downs of million for additional capitalized costs associated with former exploration projects during general and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  for compared with this was  in part  due to severance payments for a number of employees paid in the second quarter of  the write off of project evaluation costs associated with projects in russia  restricted stock bonuses recorded in the third quarter  additional costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and an increase in liability under our deferred compensation plan for directors 
an arbitration settlement of million was recorded in  and bad debt recoveries of million and million were recorded in and  respectively  related to an allowance for uncollectible accounts in prior years 
taxes other than on income increased million  or percent  during compared with this was primarily due to increased venezuelan municipal taxes which result from higher oil and gas revenues 
investment income and other increased million  or percent  during compared with this was due to higher interest rates earned on average cash balances 
interest expense decreased million  or percent  during compared with due to lower average outstanding debt balances for compared to in  we redeemed all million of our notes  and we repaid all bolivar denominated debt in march net gain loss on exchange rates decreased million  or percent  for compared with this was due to the significant devaluation of the bolivar and bolivar currency controls imposed in february which fixed the exchange rate between the bolivar and the us dollar and restricts the ability to exchange venezuelan bolivars for dollars and vice versa 

table of contents we realized income before income taxes and minority interest of million during compared with income of million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher crude oil and natural gas volumes and an increase in crude oil price in offset by the sale of our minority equity investment in geoilbent in income tax expense increased million due to higher venezuela pre tax income 
the effective tax rate increased from to percent for compared with the rate increase was due to foreign income taxes incurred on profitable foreign operations in the sale of our minority equity investment in geoilbent in was offset by us loss carryforwards 
the income before minority interest decreased million for compared with this decrease was due to the sale of our minority equity investment in geoilbent partially offset by increased production of harvest vinccler 
equity in net losses of affiliated companies decreased million during compared to this was due to the elimination of geoilbent equity losses on september   the date of its sale 
years ended december  and net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for the million net income included the gain from the sale of our minority equity investment in geoilbent of million  million partial recovery of a bad debt and million arbitration settlement related to an allowance for uncollectible accounts in prior years

oil revenue per barrel increased percent from in to in and oil sales quantities decreased percent from mbbl of oil in to mbbl of oil in during compared with gas sales began on november   at the contract rate of per mcf 
incremental crude oil sales began on the same date at a fixed price of per barrel 
total gas sales were bcf for the period 
revenue for includes mmbbls of oil at the fixed price associated with the gas sales contract 
our revenues decreased million  or percent  during compared with this was primarily due to lower production offset by higher world crude oil prices 
our sales quantities for from venezuela were mboe compared with mboe in the decrease in sales quantities of mboe  or percent  was due to the venezuelan national civil work stoppage which led to the shut in of our production from december to february  natural reservoir decline rates and the fact that some wells did not immediately return to previous production levels following the national work stoppage 
our operating expenses decreased million  or percent  for compared with this was primarily due to lower production volumes partially offset by higher workover and maintenance programs that continued during the venezuelan national civil work stoppage 
depletion  depreciation and amortization decreased million  or percent  during compared with primarily due to decreased production from venezuela and the addition of natural gas reserves in depletion expense per barrel of oil produced from venezuela during was compared with during the decrease was primarily due to reduced future development costs

table of contents balances for compared with in  we redeemed all million of our percent senior notes due in may and purchased million face of the percent senior notes due in november in october  we borrowed million to finance the construction of the gas pipeline in venezuela from the uracoa field to the pdvsa sales line  and we repaid all bolivar denominated debt in march net gain on exchange rates decreased million  or percent  for compared with this was due to the significant devaluation of the bolivar and bolivar currency controls imposed in february which fixed the exchange rate between the bolivar and the us dollar and restricts the ability to exchange venezuelan bolivars for dollars and vice versa 
we realized income before income taxes and minority interest of million during compared with income of million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the arctic gas sale in offset by the sale of our minority equity investment in geoilbent in income tax expense decreased million due to lower pre tax income 
the effective tax rate decreased from to percent for compared with the rate decrease was due to an increase in us income with no corresponding us taxes because they were offset by us operating loss carryforwards for which the benefit was fully reserved in historical periods 
the income before minority interest decreased million for compared with this decrease was due to the sale of our minority equity investment in geoilbent partially offset by decreased production of harvest vinccler 
equity in net losses of affiliated companies decreased million during from income of million in to a loss of million in this was primarily due to full cost ceiling test writedowns of million our share and decreased income from geoilbent 
see note russian operations 
the year ended included a loss of million on arctic gas 
capital resources and liquidity the oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business with unique operating and financial risks see risk factors 
we require capital principally to service debt and to fund the following costs drilling and completion costs of wells and the cost of production  treating and transportation facilities  geological  geophysical and seismic costs  and acquisition of interests in oil and gas properties 
the amount of available capital will affect the scope of our operations and the rate of our growth 
our future rate of capital resource and liquidity growth also depends substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to service our debt 
on february   the government of venezuela fixed the exchange rate between the bolivar and the us dollar  and restricted the ability to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and vice versa 
initially the exchange rate was fixed at  venezuelan bolivars for each us dollar 
on february   the official exchange rate was adjusted to  venezuelan bolivars for each us dollar 
oil companies  such as harvest vinccler are allowed to receive payments for oil sales in us dollars and pay us dollar denominated expenses from those payments 
we have substantial cash reserves and do not expect the venezuelan currency conversion restriction to adversely affect our ability to meet our short term loan obligations and operating requirements for the next twelve months 
our ability to replace production with new reserves is dependent upon the ability of harvest vinccler to make loan repayments  dividends and other cash payments to us 
however  there have been  and may again be  interruptions in oil and gas sales or there may be contractual obligations or legal impediments to receiving dividends or distributions from harvest vinccler  which could affect the ability of harvest vinccler to remit funds to us 
debt reduction 
in september  we announced that the remaining notes would be redeemed on november   and we irrevocably deposited with the trustee for the notes as trust funds million plus accrued interest through november  and a prepayment call premium of million to redeem the notes on the redemption date 
we were released from all obligations related to the notes upon deposit of the trust funds with the trustee 
we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million which includes the million prepayment call premium  million for interest related to the period october  to 
table of contents november  and million write off of unamortized debt financing costs 
our repayment of the notes triggered an obligation under the terms of harvest vinccler s loans from a venezuelan commercial bank to renegotiate the terms of those loans or  if agreement on renegotiated terms cannot be reached within days after november   the loans can be declared due and payable 
harvest vinccler is in discussions with the venezuelan bank on possible renegotiated terms 
while we believe the loans will be renegotiated  it is possible that agreement will not be reached and harvest vinccler will be required to repay the remaining balance of million 
as of february   no agreement had been reached 
working capital 
our capital resources and liquidity are affected by the receipt of the quarterly payments from pdvsa at the end of the months of february  may  august and november pursuant to the terms of the operating service agreement for the south monagas unit 
as a consequence of the timing of the pdvsa payment inflows  our cash balances can increase and decrease dramatically on a few dates during the year 
harvest vinccler s oil and gas pipeline project loans of million allow the lender to accelerate repayment if production ceases for a period greater than thirty days 
a future disruption of production could trigger the debt acceleration provision 
the net funds raised and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash at december   we had current assets of million and current liabilities of million  resulting in working capital of million and a current ratio of this compares with a working capital of million and a current ration of at december  the decrease in working capital of million was primarily due to the prepayment of the notes offset by higher crude oil prices and an increase in crude oil and natural gas sales in venezuela 
cash flow from operating activities 
during the years ended december  and  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
the million increase was due to natural gas sales  higher crude oil prices and the sale of our california onshore property  offset by harvest vinccler s purchase of two wti crude oil puts and the loss of million on the early repayment of the notes 
as of september   we no longer have an obligation to make annual interest payments of approximately million on the notes 
cash flow from investing activities 
during the years ended december  and  we had drilling and production related capital expenditures of approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures is due to the completion of our gas project in and the timing of our uracoa drilling program 
the year ended included the receipt of million from the sale of our minority equity investment in geoilbent 
the timing and size of capital expenditures for the south monagas unit are largely at our discretion  although pdvsa has recently attempted to limit harvest vinccler s capital spending see risk factors 
our remaining capital commitments worldwide support our search for new acquisitions  are relatively minimal and are substantially at our discretion 
we continue to assess production levels and commodity prices in conjunction with our capital resources and liquidity requirements 
cash flow from financing activities 
during the year ended  we irrevocably deposited with the trustee for our notes as trust funds million plus accrued interest through november  and a prepayment call premium of million to redeem the notes on the redemption date 
during the same period  harvest vinccler repaid million of its us dollar denominated debt 
during the year ended  harvest vinccler 
table of contents repaid all of its bolivar denominated debt million and million of its us dollar debt  which was an acceleration of the next two principal payments 
contractual obligations 
we have a lease obligation of approximately  per month for our houston office space 
this lease runs through april in addition  harvest vinccler leased new office space in maturin and caracas  venezuela for  and  per month  respectively 
the board of directors deferred compensation plan at december  represents  phantom stock shares with an aggregate liability of million  or per share  based on the december  stock price 
payments in thousands due by period less than after contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt building lease total while we can give no assurance  we currently believe that our cash flow from operations coupled with our cash on hand will provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund our planned capital expenditures  investments in and advances to affiliates  and quarterly interest payment obligations for the next months 
our expectation is based upon our current estimate of projected prices  production levels  and our assumptions that we will be allowed to carry out our capital program on acceptable terms  that there will be no disruptions or limitations on our production and that pdvsa will pay our invoices timely 
actual results could be materially affected if there is a significant change in our expectations or assumptions see risk factors 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including  but not limited to  the level of production and prices  as well as various economic and political conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business 
additionally  prices for oil are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of factors beyond our control 
effects of changing prices  foreign exchange rates and inflation our results of operations and cash flow are affected by changing oil prices 
fluctuations in oil prices may affect our total planned development activities and capital expenditure program 
in august and september  harvest vinccler hedged a portion of its oil sales for calendar year by purchasing two wti crude oil puts

as noted above under capital resources and liquidity  venezuela imposed currency exchange restrictions in february  and adjusted the official exchange rate in february we do not expect the currency conversion restrictions or the adjustment in the exchange rate to have a material impact on us at this time 
within the united states  inflation has had a minimal effect on us  but it is potentially an important factor in results of operations in venezuela 
with respect to harvest vinccler  a significant majority of the sources of funds  including the proceeds from oil sales  our contributions and credit financings  are denominated in us dollars  while a minor amount of local transactions in venezuela are conducted in local currency 
if the rate of increase in the value of the us dollar compared with the bolivar continues to be less than the rate of inflation in venezuela  then inflation could be expected to have an adverse effect on harvest vinccler 
during the year ended december   our net foreign exchange loss attributable to our international operations was million 
the us dollar and bolivar exchange rates were fixed in february and adjusted in february no gains or losses were recognized from february to february however  there are many factors affecting foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our control 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan currency to the us dollar 
it is not possible for us to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates and exchange controls 

table of contents critical accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
the equity method of accounting is used for companies and other investments in which we have significant influence 
all intercompany profits  transactions and balances have been eliminated 
we accounted for our investment in geoilbent and arctic gas based on a fiscal year ending september prior to their respective sales 
oil and natural gas revenue is accrued monthly based on sales 
each quarter  harvest vinccler invoices pdvsa based on barrels of oil accepted by pdvsa during the quarter  using quarterly adjusted us dollar contract service fees per barrel 
property and equipment we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties with costs accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized as incurred  including exploration overhead 
only overhead that is directly identified with acquisition  exploration or development activities is capitalized 
all costs related to production  general corporate overhead and similar activities are expensed as incurred 
the costs for china unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
at least annually  we evaluate our unproved property for possible impairment 
if we abandon all exploration efforts in china where no proved reserves are assigned  all exploration and acquisition costs associated with the country will be expensed 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expenses are difficult to predict with any certainty 
the full cost method of accounting uses proved reserves in the calculation of depletion  depreciation and amortization 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are those which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved reserves cannot be measured exactly  and the estimation of reserves involves judgmental determinations 
reserve estimates must be reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect additional information gained from reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  economic changes and other relevant developments 
the estimates are based on current technology and economic conditions  and we consider such estimates to be reasonable and consistent with current knowledge of the characteristics and extent of production 
the estimates include only those amounts considered to be proved reserves and do not include additional amounts which may result from new discoveries in the future  or from application of secondary and tertiary recovery processes where facilities are not in place or for which transportation and or marketing contracts are not in place 
changes in previous estimates of proved reserves result from new information obtained from production history  changes in economic factors and other relevant developments 
a large portion of our proved reserves base from consolidated operations is comprised of oil and gas properties that are sensitive to oil price volatility 
we are susceptible to significant upward and downward revisions to our proved reserve volumes and values as a result of changes in year end oil and gas prices and the corresponding adjustment to the projected economic life of such properties 
prices for oil and gas are likely to continue to be volatile  resulting in future revision to our proved reserve base 
we perform a quarterly cost center ceiling test of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since other than the write downs recorded by our equity affiliates 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved reserves will change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  even if only for a short period of time  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 

table of contents income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects  calculated at currently enacted rates  of a future deductible taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns  and b operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
foreign currency our current operations are in venezuela 
the us dollar is our functional and reporting currency 
amounts denominated in non us currencies are re measured in u 
s dollars  and all currency gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations 
we attempt to manage our operations in such a manner as to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange losses 
however  there are many factors that affect foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our influence 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan bolivar to the us dollar 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard revised share based payment sfas r  an amendment to statement of accounting standards and sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
public companies with a calendar year end will be required to adopt the provisions of the standard effective for periods beginning after june  we do not expect sfas r to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard exchanges on nonmonetary assets sfas  an amendment of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
opinion 
sfas amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
we do not expect sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab which provides guidance regarding the interaction of sfas with the calculation of depletion and the full cost ceiling test of oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec 
the guidance provided in sab is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise that has the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the vie 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  interpretation no 
r fin r  to clarify some of the provisions of fin  and to defer certain entities from adopting until the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  application of fin r is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application for all other types of vies is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  we believe we have no arrangements that would require the application of fin r 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates and foreign exchange risk  as discussed below 
oil prices as an independent oil producer  our revenue  other income and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
historically  prices received for oil production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
harvest vinccler hedged a portion of its oil production by purchasing a wti crude oil put to protect its cash flow 
in august and september  harvest vinccler hedged a portion of its oil sales for calendar year by purchasing two wti crude oil puts 
because gains or losses associated with hedging transactions are included in oil sales when the hedged production is delivered  such gains and losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
see note derivatives and hedging for a complete discussion of our derivative activity 
we had no hedging transactions in place for our production 
interest rates total short term debt at december  of million consisted of harvest vinccler us dollar denominated variable rate loans 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in the interest rate would not have a material affect on our results of operations 
foreign exchange for the venezuelan operations  oil and gas sales are received under a contract in effect through in us dollars  expenditures are both in us dollars and local currency 
we have utilized no currency hedging programs to mitigate any risks associated with operations in these countries  and therefore our financial results are subject to favorable or unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation in these countries 
venezuela has recently imposed currency exchange controls see capital resources and liquidity above
