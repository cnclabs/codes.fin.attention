overview we are a fully integrated self administered and self managed reit and one of the largest owners and developers of class a office properties in the united states 
our properties are concentrated in four core markets boston  midtown manhattan  washington  dc and san francisco 
we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our class a office space to our tenants 
factors we consider when we lease space include creditworthiness of the tenant  the length of the lease  the rental rate to be paid  costs of tenant improvements  operating costs and real estate taxes  vacancy  current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors 
improvement in our industry s performance is generally predicated on a sustained pattern of job growth 
office market conditions  generally viewed as having bottomed out in  showed further improvement during in midtown manhattan  washington  dc and princeton  new jersey 
in boston and san francisco  our two other markets  we are cautiously optimistic that we are seeing the beginning of a recovery in job growth that will generate additional demand for office space 
even in those markets where tenants are expanding  however  landlord pricing power is still constrained by the number of competitive alternatives available 
in this climate  we believe our corporate strategy of owning and developing high quality office buildings concentrated in strong  supply constrained markets and emphasizing long term leases to creditworthy tenants has allowed us to perform well relative to our peers in difficult markets and even better in favorable markets 
in addition  we believe our financial strategy of matching long term fixed rate debt with our long term leases insulates us from rising interest costs and  accordingly  we have fixed the interest rate on of our outstanding debt 
during  our strategy enabled us to complete more than six million square feet of leasing while managing transactions costs and non recurring capital expenses 
in addition  we commenced construction on million of new developments which we expect will be placed into service during and other highlights of our activity include the following 
we completed the construction of two development projects  the  square foot times square tower building in new york city  new york and the  square foot new dominion technology park  building two building in fairfax county  virginia 
times square tower and new dominion technology park  building two are currently and leased  respectively 
we leveraged our strong relationships to acquire million of interests in real estate assets in the washington  dc area  and we acquired our partner s interest in a joint venture in the boston suburbs for million in cash and the assumption of our partner s share of the mortgage debt on the properties of approximately million 
we sold eighteen properties totaling  square feet and three land parcels for sale prices totaling million 
on march   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the proceeds from this public offering  net of underwriters discount and offering costs  totaled approximately million 
we used the proceeds from this offering to 
table of contents repay approximately million in mortgage indebtedness related to three properties  together with prepayment penalties totaling approximately million as well as to acquire the remaining interest in one of our joint ventures for approximately million 
we formed the value added fund  which is a strategic partnership with two institutional investors  to pursue the acquisition of assets within our existing markets that have deficiencies in property characteristics which provide an opportunity to create value through repositioning  refurbishment or renovation 
looking ahead  we believe will follow a pattern similar to that of  with office rental markets continuing to strengthen  but with improvement coming gradually 
we expect allocators of capital to continue to place a premium on high quality  well located office buildings resulting in lower capitalization rates and higher prices per square foot 
as an owner of these types of assets  we are pleased with higher valuations and intend to sell non core properties to realize some of this value 
however  these conditions also make it more difficult to acquire assets at what we believe to be attractive rates of return 
we will continue to be patient as markets recover  demand grows and development proceeds on the significant pre lease projects underway and stand ready to aggressively capitalize on opportunities with our well positioned balance sheet where we can use our competitive edge to enhance performance 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets  including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value  including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants  the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
based on our acquisitions to date  our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial 
we record acquired above and below market leases at their fair value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between the contractual amounts 
table of contents to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
real estate is stated at depreciated cost 
the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property  legal fees and other acquisition costs 
costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  internal wages  property taxes  insurance  and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
if such impairment is present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used as defined by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
sfas no 
 which was adopted on january   requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale  operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
following the classification of a property as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
after determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgement 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction 

table of contents investments in unconsolidated joint ventures except for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over  but do not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over years or the term of the agreement  if shorter 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses  however  our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture s distribution priorities  which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds 
for ownership interest in variance interest entities  we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary 
revenue recognition base rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases 
accrued rental income represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements 
our leasing strategy is generally to secure financially stable tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines 
furthermore  following the initiation of a lease  we continue to actively monitor the tenant s creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value 
when assessing tenant credit quality  we review relevant financial information  including financial ratios  net worth  debt to market capitalization  and liquidity evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant s management team perform an analysis of the tenant s industry as a result of the underwriting process  tenants are then categorized into one of three categories low risk tenants the tenant s credit is such that we require collateral require security deposit  and reduce upfront tenant improvement investment tenant s credit is below our acceptable parameters 
table of contents we maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential loses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease 
tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of with a rating of representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of representing the lowest credit rating  recording a full reserve against the receivable balance 
among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include payment history  credit status and change in status credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric  change in tenant space needs ie  expansion downsize  tenant financial performance  and industry or geographical specific credit considerations if our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received  the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
the average remaining term of our in place tenant leases was approximately years as of december  the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base  reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants 
recoveries from tenants  consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs  are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or issue issue requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk 
our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service  fax machine use  movie and vending commissions  meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services 
hotel revenues are recognized as earned 
management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management  and not on a straight line basis  since such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land  building  tenant improvements  acquired above and below market leases  origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over 
table of contents their useful lives 
the amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments for purposes of disclosure  we calculate the fair value of our mortgage debt notes payable and unsecured senior notes 
we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate 
in determining the current market rate  we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates  the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and commencing during the third quarter of  we began reporting on a consolidated basis the gross operating revenues and expenses associated with the ownership of our hotels through our taxable reit subsidiary  whereas we had previously only reported net lease payments and real estate taxes 
as a result  the reporting of the hotel operations for the year ended december  is not directly comparable to the year ended at december  and  we owned or had interests in a portfolio of and properties  respectively the total property portfolio 
as a result of changes within our total property portfolio  the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period 
accordingly  we do not believe that our period to period financial data are comparable 
therefore  the comparison of operating results for the year ended and show separately changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared the same property portfolio and the changes attributable to the total property portfolio 
in our analysis of operating results  particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful  it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented 
we refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio 
the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented 
net operating income  or noi  is a non gaap financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus minority interest in operating partnership  net derivative losses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  general and administrative expense  losses from early extinguishments of debt and losses on investments in securities  less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations net of minority interest  income from discontinued operations net of minority interest  gains on sales of real estate and land held for development net of minority interest  income from unconsolidated joint ventures  minority interest in property partnerships  interest and other income and development and management services income 
we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level 
therefore  we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets 

table of contents our management also uses noi to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations 
further  we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because  when compared across periods  noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
noi excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property s results of operations 
for example  interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level 
in addition  depreciation and amortization  because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  may distort operating performance at the property level 
noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits that define noi differently 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  noi should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio 
the same property portfolio consists of properties  including three hotels and three properties in which we have joint venture interests  acquired or placed in service on or prior to january  and owned by us through december  the total property portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either  placed in service  acquired or repositioned after january  or disposed of on or prior to december  this table includes a reconciliation from same property portfolio to total property portfolio by also providing information for the properties which were sold  acquired  placed in service or repositioned for the years ended december  and our net property operating margins  which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses  exclusive of the three hotel properties  for the year ended december  and  were and  respectively

table of contents rental revenue the increase in rental revenue of million in the total property portfolio primarily relates to the purchase of the remaining interests in one and two discovery square as of april   the remaining interests in one and two freedom square as of august   new hampshire avenue on october  and kendrick street as of march   as well as the acquisition of connecticut avenue on april  these additions to the portfolio increased revenue by approximately million  as detailed below property date acquired revenue for the year ended change in thousands one and two discovery square april     one and two freedom square august     new hampshire avenue october     kendrick street march    connecticut avenue april    total in addition  the placing into service of times square tower and new dominion technology park  building two during the third quarter of  as well as shaws supermarket and waltham weston corporate center during  increased revenue by approximately million for the year ended december   as detailed below property date placed in service revenue for the year ended change in thousands times square tower rd quarter    waltham weston corporate center st quarter    shaws supermarket nd quarter   new dominion technology park  building two rd quarter   total the aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by a decrease of approximately million due to the sale of n street during and hilltop office center during  both of which have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continued involvement in the management of the properties 
the decrease in the remaining same property portfolio reflects a decrease in straight line rents of million  which was partially offset by an increase in rental revenue  including operating income  parking and other income  of approximately million for the year ended december  we anticipate that we will experience a roll down of approximately to in rents in on our expiring leases which will be partially offset by increased occupancy and greater contributions from newly delivered buildings such as times square tower and new dominion technology park  building two 
in september  we commenced the redevelopment of our capital gallery property in washington  dc capital gallery is a class a office property totaling approximately  square feet 
the project entails removing a three story low rise section of the property comprised of  square feet from in service status and developing it into a story office building resulting in a total complex size of approximately  square feet upon completion 
the classification of this property is included in properties repositioned for the year ended december  rental revenue has decreased for the year ended december  due to taking the three story low rise out of service in september 
table of contents termination income termination income for the year ended december  was related to twenty tenants across the portfolio that terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately million 
this compared to termination income earned for the year ended december  related to nineteen tenants totaling million 
we have experienced a reduction in the number of tenants having trouble paying rent and bankruptcy issues 
in addition  fewer tenants have been making efforts to terminate or restructure their leases in order to provide them with financial relief 
interest and other income interest and other income increased by million for the year ended december  in the first quarter of we recognized a net amount of approximately million in connection with the termination by a third party of an agreement to enter into a ground lease with us 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  we had a cash balance of approximately million which also contributed to higher interest earnings 
to the extent we do not use our cash balance to acquire properties  fund new developments  or reduce outstanding indebtedness  we anticipate interest income to increase slightly based on anticipated increases in interest rates 
operating expenses property operating expenses in the total property portfolio real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  repairs and maintenance  cleaning and other property related expenses increased by million 
same property portfolio real estate tax expense increased approximately million for the year end due to increased real estate tax assessments  specifically in new york city 
this increase was offset by a decrease of approximately million across the portfolio in repairs and maintenance expenses for the year end as well as increases in other expenses of approximately million  resulting in a net increase to same property portfolio operating expenses of approximately million 
approximately million of the increase in total property portfolio operating expenses primarily relates to the additions of one and two discovery square  one and two freedom square  new hampshire avenue  kendrick street and connecticut avenue  as detailed below property date acquired operating expenses for the year ended change in thousands one and two discovery square april    one and two freedom square august     new hampshire avenue october    kendrick street march    connecticut avenue april    total 
table of contents in addition  the placing into service of times square tower and new dominion technology park  building two during the third quarter of  as well as shaws supermarket and waltham weston corporate center during  increased operating expenses by approximately million  as detailed below property date placed in service operating expenses for the year ended change in thousands times square tower rd quarter   waltham weston corporate center st quarter   shaws supermarket nd quarter new dominion technology park  building two rd quarter total these increases were offset by a decrease of an aggregate of million related to the sales of n street in and hilltop office center in  both of which have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continued involvement in the management of the properties 
our capital gallery property in washington  dc has been classified as properties repositioned for the year ended december  hotel net operating income net operating income for the hotel properties increased by approximately million  or approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  on a year to year comparison  the hotels showed improvement and we expect this improvement to continue into the following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the three hotel properties for the year ended december  and increase occupancy average daily rate revenue per available room  revpar development and management services our third party fee income increased approximately million for the year ended compared to our third party fees in washington  dc with national institute of health and in new york at church street collectively increased development and management services by million for the year ended december  the completion of these projects along with the winding down of other projects is expected to result in a decrease of approximately million of third party management income in we will continue to pursue new fee services during and in future years  however  will be focused on our increased pipeline of development projects which we commenced in our management fees increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to other expenses general and administrative general and administrative expenses in the total property portfolio increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  by million  or 
an aggregate of approximately million of the increase is attributable to changes in the form of long term equity based compensation  as further described below 
during the fourth quarter we exercised our right to terminate the purchase agreement to acquire the acre site on the boston waterfront known as fan pier 
in conjunction with 
table of contents the termination  we recognized approximately million of general and administrative expense consisting of our share of the forfeited deposit of million and approximately million of related due diligence costs 
in addition  we recognized an expense of million representing our payment to alan b 
landis in connection with the amendment to the development agreement  as further detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other major increases during included the following increases in state taxes based on income and net worth of approximately million  increases of approximately million in professional fees in connection with the sarbanes oxley act as well as fees related to increased responsibilities of our board of directors  and an increase of approximately million related to bonus and salaries for the year ended december  in  we issued restricted stock and or ltip units  as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock  under the stock option and incentive plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation 
an ltip unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock 
employees vest in restricted stock and ltip units over a five year term     and 
restricted stock and ltip units are measured at fair market value on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as reported on the new york stock exchange 
such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period 
to the extent restricted stock or ltip units are forfeited prior to vesting  the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock was approximately million for the year ended december  stock based compensation expense associated with million of restricted stock that was granted in january will generally be expensed ratably as such restricted stock vests over a five year vesting period 
stock based compensation associated with approximately million granted in january and approximately million granted in january of restricted stock and ltip units will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and ltip units vest 
to the extent we continue to grant restricted stock and ltip awards  our expenses will continue to increase significantly until even if there are no future increases in the aggregate value of restricted equity granted each year 
this is because we expense the value of the restricted stock and ltip awards ratably over the five year vesting period and a full run rate will not be achieved until 
table of contents interest expense interest expense for the total property portfolio increased approximately million 
the majority of the increase is due to the cessation of interest capitalization at times square tower and new dominion technology park  building two  as well as the acquisition of kendrick street and connecticut avenue  which were offset by the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt on one and two reston overlook  as well as the lockheed martin building and nima building in the beginning of our floating rate debt now consists entirely of our refinanced construction loan on times square tower 
the following summarizes our outstanding debt as of december  compared with december  dollars in thousands debt summary balance fixed rate variable rate total percent of total debt fixed rate variable rate total weighted average interest rate at end of period fixed rate variable rate total depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the total portfolio increased as a result of the acquisitions of one and two discovery square  one and two freedom square  new hampshire avenue  kendrick street and connecticut avenue as well as the properties placed in service during and these additions to the portfolio increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately million  as detailed below depreciation for the year ended property acquired placed in service change in thousands one and two freedom square acquired    times square tower placed in service   new hampshire avenue acquired    one and two discovery square acquired    waltham weston corporate center placed in service   connecticut avenue acquired   kendrick street acquired   shaws supermarket placed in service new dominion technology park  building two placed in service   total additions 
table of contents in september  we commenced the redevelopment of our capital gallery property in washington  dc which is classified as properties repositioned for the year ended december  in connection with the redevelopment project  we recognized an accelerated depreciation charge of approximately million  which represents the net book value of the portion of the three story  low rise portion of the building which will be redeveloped 
capitalized costs costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results 
these costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets and amortized over their useful lives 
capitalized development costs include interest  wages  property taxes  insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
capitalized wages for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above 
interest capitalized for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
these costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above 
during the third quarter of  we placed the development projects comprised of times square tower and new dominion technology park  building two into service and ceased capitalizing interest in accordance with our capitalization policy 
net derivative losses net derivative losses for the total property portfolio represent the adjustments to fair value and cash settlements of our derivative contract that are not effective for accounting purposes

employees vest in restricted stock and ltip units over a five year term 
restricted stock and ltip units are measured at fair market value on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as reported on the new york stock exchange 
such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period

stock based compensation associated with approximately million of restricted stock and ltip units that were granted in january will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and ltip units vest 
interest expense interest expense for the total portfolio increased as a result of our strategic decision to replace our variable rate debt with primarily unsecured fixed rate debt and a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest on development projects which was instead expensed

we believe that these needs will be satisfied using our current cash balance  cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities 
rental revenue  recovery income from tenants  and other income from operations are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification 
we seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our office real estate management  leasing  development and construction businesses 
consequently  we believe our revenue  together with proceeds from financing activities  will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs 
however  material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes 
our failure to comply with financial covenants could adversely impact our ability to access additional financing to fund our operations including distributions  debt service payments and capital expenditures 
our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments  property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements 
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following construction loans  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  income from operations  joint ventures  
table of contents sales of real estate  issuances of additional common and preferred units of the operating partnership and or our equity securities  and our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short term bridge facilities 
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs 
our line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities and meet short term development needs 
we fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by bplp until project completion or lease up thresholds are achieved 
in  we completed three offerings of unsecured investment grade senior notes and expect to utilize the bond market  asset backed mortgage financing and common and preferred equity as cost effective capital sources for other long term capital needs
