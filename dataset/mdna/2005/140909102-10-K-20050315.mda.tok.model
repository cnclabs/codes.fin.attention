item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a major manufacturer of recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products 
we operate in four business segments 
the paperboard segment manufactures recycled uncoated and clay coated paperboard 
the recovered fiber segment collects and sells recycled paper and brokers recycled paper and other paper rolls 
the tube  core and composite container segment produces spiral and convolute wound tubes  cores and cans 
the carton and custom packaging segment produces printed and unprinted folding carton and set up boxes and provides contract manufacturing and packaging services 
our business is vertically integrated to a large extent 
this means that our converting operations consume a large portion of our own paperboard production  approximately in the remaining of our paperboard production is sold to external customers in any of the four recycled paperboard end use markets tube  core and composite containers  folding cartons  gypsum wallboard facing paper and other specialty products 
these integration statistics do not include volume produced or converted by our owned  unconsolidated joint ventures premier boxboard limited and standard gypsum  llp 
as part of our strategy to optimize our operating efficiency  each of our mills can produce recycled paperboard for more than one end use market 
this allows us to shift production among mills in response to customer or market demands 
historically  we have grown our business  revenues and production capacity to a significant degree through acquisitions 
based on the difficult operating climate for our industry and our financial position over the last several years  the pace of our acquisition activity  and correspondingly  our revenue growth  has slowed as we have focused on conserving cash and maximizing the productivity of our existing facilities 
we are a holding company that operated our business through subsidiaries as of march  we also own a interest in two joint ventures with temple inland  inc we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
key business indicator and trends our industry has historically been closely correlated with the domestic economy in general  and with consumer nondurable consumption packaging segment and industrial production tube  core and composite containers segment  specifically 
these demand drivers tend to be cyclical in nature  with cycles lasting years depending on such factors as gross domestic product  interest rates and other factors 
as these demand drivers fluctuate  we typically experience variability in volume and revenue in our business 
from late through  the recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products industry was in a down cycle 
since our industry has improved but has not returned to historical levels of demand and capacity utilization 
while we believe that future operating results may improve  we cannot ascertain when or to what extent this may occur 
the key operating indicator of our business is paperboard mill operating rates 
mill operating rates are calculated as the ratio of production compared with capacity  assuming a normalized mill schedule of days per year 
as paperboard mill operating rates increase  cost per ton of paperboard generally decreases 
as these tons are sold  profitability increases since fixed production costs are absorbed by more tons produced 
additionally  higher operating rates generally provide enhanced opportunity to recover material and labor increases through improved pricing 
this positively affects paperboard and converted products income from operations and cash flow 
paperboard mill operating rates are affected by demand and by mill closures 
industry demand decreased from due primarily to a recessionary general economy  the continued migration of us manufacturing offshore to lower labor cost environments and product substitution  eg plastic standup pouches used for packaging instead of boxes 
the decrease in demand resulted in a decrease in operating rates 
we expect the migration of us manufacturing offshore and product substitution to continue  although at a 
table of contents slower rate  which could continue to negatively affect operating results 
we further expect these trends to be somewhat offset by the improving domestic economy  increased market share and our own paperboard mill capacity reductions 
recent industry improvement in operating rates has been driven by paperboard mill closures  as over million tons of capacity  or approximately of the recycled paperboard mill total capacity  was closed from through we have closed approximately thousand tons of our own paperboard mill capacity during this period to better match our supply capabilities to demand 
logo industry source american forest and paper association 
restructuring has been a primary component of management s strategy to address the decrease in demand resulting from secular trends  as discussed above  and generally weak domestic economic conditions 
between and  restructuring and asset impairment charges have totaled million  of which approximately million have been noncash charges  see results of operations and results of operations 
we have also experienced increases in near term manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs as a result of our transitioning of business within our mill and converting systems to other company facilities 
our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our competitiveness through reduced costs  increase revenue through delivery of differentiated quality products and services to our customers  and promote compliance with recent changes in legal and regulatory requirements 
our restructuring efforts have been directed toward reducing costs through manufacturing and converting facilities rationalization where we believed it was advantageous to do so due to geographic overlap  duplicative capabilities  changes in customer base and other factors 
rationalization of facilities typically results in increased cash outlays and expenses initially  for example  severance costs 
restructuring charges increased in versus but we believe that future earnings and cash flows will be favorably impacted by our continued efforts to reconfigure our business to increase efficiency and better match supply with customer demand 
recovered fiber  which is derived from recycled paper stock  is our most significant raw material 
historically  the cost of recovered fiber has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions 
for example  our average recovered fiber cost per ton of paperboard produced increased from per ton in to per ton in  an increase of  before dropping to per ton in recovered fiber cost per ton averaged and during and  respectively  an increase of 
table of contents excluding raw materials and labor  energy is our most significant manufacturing cost 
energy consists of fuel used to generate steam used in the paper making process and electrical purchases to operate our paperboard machines and all of our converting machinery 
in  the average energy cost in our mill system was approximately per ton compared to per ton in  a increase 
in energy costs averaged per ton  a decrease of from until the last few years  our business had not been significantly affected by energy cost increases  and we historically have not passed increases in energy costs through to our customers 
consequently  as the volatility of energy prices has increased dramatically over the last three years  we have not been able to pass through to our customers all of the energy cost increases we have incurred 
as a result  our operating margins have been adversely affected 
although we continue to evaluate our energy costs and consider ways to factor energy costs into our pricing  we cannot give assurance that our operating margins and results of operations will not continue to be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
see part i  item  risk factors our operating margins may be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
we raise our selling prices in response to increases in raw material and energy costs 
however  we often are unable to pass the full amount of these costs through to our customers on a timely basis due to supply and demand in the industry  and as a result often cannot maintain our operating margins in the face of dramatic cost increases 
we experience margin shrinkage during all periods of cost increases due to customary time lags in implementing our price increases 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to recover any future increases in the cost of recovered fiber by raising the prices of our products 
even if we are able to recover future cost increases  our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation of price increases 
see part i  item  risk factors our business and financial performance may be harmed by future increases in raw material and other operating costs 
critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves forming estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
changes in these estimates are recorded periodically based on updated information 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue and the related account receivable when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
generally  we recognize revenue when we ship our manufactured products or when we complete a service and title and risk of loss passes to our customers 
provisions for discounts  returns  allowances  customer rebates and other adjustments which have averaged less than of sales for the years ended december   and are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are determined based on historical experience or specific customer arrangements 
accounts receivable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
when we become aware of a customer whose financial viability is questionable  we closely monitor collection of their receivable balance and may require the customer to prepay for current shipments 
if a customer enters a bankruptcy action  we monitor the progress of that action to determine when and if an additional provision for noncollectibility 
table of contents is warranted 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december   and was million  million and million  respectively  and our provision for uncollectible accounts was million  million and million for the years ending  and  respectively 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
inventory 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes raw materials  direct and indirect labor  employee benefits  energy and fuel  depreciation  chemicals and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management reviews inventory at least quarterly to determine the necessity of write offs for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
inventory over six months old is generally deemed unsaleable at first quality prices unless customer arrangements or other special circumstances exist 
we reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on management s judgment of future realization 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the write offs required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory  however  in  and  these write offs  other than those related to specific customer bankruptcies  were insignificant 
goodwill 
we test the carrying amount of goodwill at least annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes  growth rates of selling prices and costs  changes in working capital  investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
we also test the sensitivities of fair value estimates to changes in our growth assumptions of sales volumes  selling prices and costs 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit that contains goodwill exceeds fair value  a possible impairment is indicated 
if a possible impairment is indicated  we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit attributed to those net assets 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recorded 
we also use judgment in assessing whether we should test more frequently for impairment than annually 
factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions  competition  product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments 
based on our goodwill impairment testing completed during the fourth quarter of  we have determined that our million of goodwill is not impaired 
impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in conditions may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important that could initiate an impairment review include the following significant operating losses recurring operating losses significant declines in demand for a product produced by an asset capable of producing only that product assets that are idled or held for sale assets that are likely to be divested the impairment review requires management to estimate future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset or group of assets and sum the estimated future cash flows 
if the future undiscounted cash flows is less 
table of contents than the carrying amount of the asset  then we must estimate the fair value of the asset 
if the fair value of the asset is below the carrying value  then the difference will be written off 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of the asset or group of assets may materially affect our asset values and results of operations 
impairment charges of and million were recorded in and  respectively  related to assets held for sale 
the charges represent the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
self insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and health care costs  subject to specific retention levels 
consulting actuaries and administrators assist us in determining our liability for self insured claims 
our self insured workers compensation liability is estimated based on actual claims as established by a third party administrator  increased by factors that reflect our historical claim development 
the developed claim  net of amounts paid and discounted to present value  represents the liability that we record in our financial statements 
the primary controllable driver of our workers compensation liability is the loss development factor that estimates the amount to which one dollar in actual claims incurred will ultimately grow over the life of the claim  which may be several years 
a change in the loss development factors utilized for would have resulted in a thousand change in workers compensation expense and accrued liability at december  our self insured health care liability is estimated based on our actual claim experience and multiplied by a time lag factor of days 
the lag factor represents an estimate based on historical experience of claims that have been incurred and should be recorded as a liability  but have not been reported 
a change in the lag factor would have resulted in a thousand change in our healthcare costs and accrued liability at december  future actual costs related to self insured coverages will depend on claims incurred  medical cost trends  which have increased in recent years  safety performance and various other factors related to our employee population  which has decreased in recent years 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses carried forward and state tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our statement of operations and our balance sheet 
at december  and  we had net federal and state deferred tax assets related to net operating losses of and million  respectively 
at december  and the company established valuation allowances of and million for a portion of these deferred tax assets  respectively 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits 
we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan the pension plan 
the pension plan provides benefits to be paid to all eligible employees at retirement based primarily on years of service with the company and compensation rates in effect near retirement 
our policy is to fund benefits attributed to employees services to date as well as service expected to be earned in the future 
during september  the maximum deductible contribution of million was made to the pension plan relating to the plan year  and there were no contributions made in relating to the plan year 
based on our current estimate of future funding requirements  we do not expect to make a contribution during the year ended december  in september  the company announced the suspension of any further pension benefits for certain employees covered by the pension plan 
the suspension was effective as of december  and froze the accrued pension benefits for employees not subject to a collective bargaining agreement and employees who do not qualify for continued benefits based on years of service and age requirements 
the curtailment reduced the company s december  projected benefit obligation by million and increased pension expense by thousand 
certain executives participate in a supplemental executive retirement plan serp  which provides retirement benefits to participants based on average compensation 
the serp was unfunded at december  the determination of our pension plan and serp benefit obligations and expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the weighted average discount rate  the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets and the weighted average rate of compensation increase 
the following table is a summary of the significant assumptions we used to determine our projected benefit obligation as of december  weighted average discount rate weighted average rate of compensation increase the following table is a summary of the significant assumptions to determine net periodic pension expense for the years ended december  weighted average discount rate weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets weighted average rate of compensation increase in developing the weighted average discount rate  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including estimated timing of obligation payments and yields for long term bonds that received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate  determined on this basis  was lowered from at december  to at december  based on analysis of the rating and maturity of the long term bonds  the timing of payment obligations and the input from our actuaries  we concluded that a discount rate of is appropriate and reflects the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds that has the same duration as the plan obligations 
future actual pension expense and benefit obligations will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to populations participating in our pension plans 
a change in the discount rate would result in a change in the december  projected benefit obligation of approximately million and estimated net pension expense of approximately thousand 

table of contents in developing our weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets  we evaluated such criteria as return expectations by asset class and long term inflation assumptions 
our expected weighted average rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of equity  fixed income and investment in a portfolio of hedge funds 
we regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that the expected weighted average rate of return of for december  is appropriate 
a change in the weighted average expected rate of return would change estimated net pension expense thousand 
since no contribution was required or made in  the under funded status of our pension plan and the serp increased by approximately million in while we believe that the assumptions we have used are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension plan and serp liability 
we also provide postretirement medical benefits at certain of our subsidiaries 
our net periodic postretirement benefit cost for medical costs was approximately thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at december  and were determined using a weighted average discount rate of and  respectively 
the rate of increase in the costs of covered health care benefits is assumed to be in  decreasing each year to by the year increasing the assumed health care costs trend rate by one percentage point would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately thousand and would have increased net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately thousand for the year ended december  depreciation 
management is required to make estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of long lived assets 
these estimates can significantly affect depreciation expense and accordingly  both results of operations and the asset values reflected on the balance sheet 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed a comprehensive review of the remaining estimated useful lives of our machinery and equipment 
as a result of this review  we revised our estimate of the useful lives for production machinery and equipment from an average of approximately years to an average of approximately years 
we believe that the change more appropriately reflects the useful lives of the assets 
the effect of this change in estimated useful lives has been accounted for on a prospective basis 
the estimated impact of this change was a decrease in depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of of approximately million and a decrease of approximately million in this change decreased the net loss and net loss per common share by approximately million or per common share and million or per common share for the years ended december  and shipping and handling cost reclassification 
certain shipping and handling costs were reclassified from selling  general and administrative expenses to cost of sales 
eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  allows companies to classify these costs as cost of sales 
this reclassification was made because management believes that this presentation is more comparable to our competitors and would be beneficial to users of our financial statements 
these shipping and handling costs were for items such as pallets  shrink wrap and other items used to prepare our product for shipment to the customer 
the shipping and handling costs reclassified in and and the resulting impact on gross profit was as follows in thousands years ended december  gross profit reported in k a shipping and handling costs reclassification gross profit reported in k percentage decrease in gross profit 
table of contents results of operations the following table shows paperboard shipment volume  selling price per ton  recovered fiber cost per ton for the paperboard mills  and paperboard cost per ton for the tube and core operations for the periods indicated 
the information below showing average net selling price and average cost per ton  is presented because management believes they are the most significant indicators of profitability for the paperboard segment and the tube  core and composite container segment 
historically  recovered fiber has been our largest raw material cost component and has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions 
however  these drivers are not the only factors that can impact these segments 
see risk factors in part i  item for additional discussion of factors that impact our business 
also note that a portion of our sales do not have related paperboard volume  such as sales of contract packaging services and sales of recovered fiber

total paperboard tonnage increased in tons sold from paperboard mill production increased in total tons sold to our converters increased in total paperboard tonnage increased due to the following factors an increase in sales of unconverted paperboard to external customers in the other specialty and tube  core and composite container end use markets 
an increase in internal conversion by our tube  core and composite container segment  carton and custom packaging segment and other specialty converting operations 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of unconverted paperboard to external customers in the folding carton end use market  primarily driven by weak demand in our coated paperboard mill system  combined with the closing of one of two coated recycled paperboard machines at our rittman  ohio facility 
lower sales of unconverted paperboard shipped to our customers in the gypsum end use market 
this decrease was primarily due to the transfer of volume from our buffalo paperboard mill to our owned  unconsolidated  premier boxboard joint venture 
including the volume from premier boxboard  gypsum volume increased to thousand tons in compared with thousand tons for the same period in

the information below showing average net selling price and average cost per ton  is presented because management believes they are the most significant indicators of profitability for the paperboard segment and the tube  core and composite container segment 
historically  recovered fiber has been our largest raw material cost component and has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions 
however  these drivers are not the only factors that can impact these segments 
see risk factors in part i  item for an additional discussion of factors that impact our business

total paperboard tonnage for was nearly flat  increasing only from likewise  tons sold from paperboard mill production increased by only in total tonnage converted increased in the positive effects on tonnage were primarily related to higher internal conversion by our tube  core and composite container segment 
the higher conversion was primarily driven by the tube and core plants acquired in september higher internal conversion by our other specialty converting operations  primarily the partition plants that were acquired in september of these improvements were largely offset by a decrease in internal conversion by our folding carton operations due to weak demand 
a decrease in sales of unconverted paperboard to the gypsum wallboard facing paper end use market 
this decrease was primarily due to the transfer of volume from our buffalo paperboard mill  which was closed in march  to our owned  unconsolidated  premier boxboard joint venture 
including the volume from premier boxboard  gypsum volume increased to thousand tons in compared with thousand tons for the same period in the decision to stop serving certain customers in conjunction with idling one of the two coated recycled paperboard machines at our rittman  ohio facility 
a decrease in sales of unconverted paperboard to the folding carton end use market due to weak demand in that end use market

net loss 
due to the factors discussed above  net loss for was million  or net loss per common share  compared to net loss of million  or net loss per common share  in liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources and risks 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility  described below 
downturns in operations can significantly affect our ability to generate cash 
factors that can affect our operating results and liquidity are discussed further in this annual report 
table of contents under risk factors in part i  item in  we generated million in cash from operations 
we believe that our cash on hand at december  of million and borrowing availability of million  under our senior credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
additionally  based on our historical ability to generate cash  we believe we will be able to meet our long term cash requirements 
however  if we are unable to generate cash at historic levels  our ability to meet long term requirements is uncertain 
the following are factors that could affect our future ability to generate cash from operations a contraction in domestic demand for recycled paperboard and related packaging products similar to what our industry experienced in  and increased market acceptance of alternative products  such as flexible packaging and plastics  that have replaced or can replace certain of our packaging products 
continued export of domestic industrial manufacturing operations 
significant unforeseen adverse conditions in our industry or the markets we serve 
the occurrence  continuation or exacerbation of these conditions could require us to seek additional funds from external sources in order to meet our liquidity requirements 
in such event  our ability to obtain additional funds would depend on the various business and credit market conditions prevailing at the time  which are difficult to predict and many of which are out of our control 
our ability to secure additional funds could also be materially adversely affected by our substantial indebtedness 
additional risks related to our substantial indebtedness are discussed in part i  item  risk factors our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness 
the availability of liquidity from our existing borrowings is primarily affected by our continued compliance with the terms of the agreement governing our senior credit facility  including the payment of interest and compliance with various covenants and financial maintenance tests 
we were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility during absent a deterioration of the us economy as a whole or the specific sectors on which our business depends see part i  item  risk factors our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by downturns in industrial production  housing and construction and the consumption of the remainder of durable and nondurable goods  we believe we will be in compliance with our covenants under the senior credit agreement during the remainder of see subsequent event for additional information

table of contents we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements 
see contractual obligations below and the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which detail these future obligations and commitments 
interest rate swap agreements 
in  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements in notional amounts totaling million 
the agreements  which had payment and expiration dates that corresponded to the terms of the note obligations they covered  effectively converted million of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes and million of our fixed rate senior notes into variable rate obligations 
the variable rates were based on the three month libor plus a fixed margin 
in august  we unwound our million interest rate swap agreement related to the senior subordinated notes and received million from the bank counter party

off balance sheet arrangements joint venture financings 
as noted above  we own a interest in two joint ventures with temple inland  inc standard gypsum  lp and premier boxboard limited llc 
because we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting  the indebtedness of these joint ventures is not reflected in the liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheets 
standard gypsum manufactures gypsum wallboard  and premier boxboard is a low cost recycled paperboard mill that produces a lightweight gypsum facing paper along with containerboard grades 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for summarized financial information for these joint ventures 
standard gypsum is the obligor under reimbursement agreements pursuant to which direct pay letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately million were originally issued for its account in support of industrial revenue bond obligations 
standard gypsum replaced these letters of credit in october with new direct pay letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  issued by a replacement lender 
we are severally obligated for of standard gypsum s obligations for reimbursement of letter of credit drawings  interest  fees and other amounts 
the other standard gypsum partner  temple inland  has guaranteed of standard gypsum s obligations 
as of december   the outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately million  for one half of which we are obligated approximately million 
if either joint venture partner had defaulted under its support arrangements  our total obligation would have been million at december  in october  standard gypsum redeemed these industrial revenue bonds in full with the proceeds of drawings on the direct pay letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  which must be repaid in full by october  as of december   our obligation with respect to the reimbursement of these letter of credit drawings is supported by a letter of credit in the face amount of million  issued in favor of the standard gypsum lender 
this letter of credit was issued under our senior credit facility and expires in october the letter of credit may be drawn in the event of a default under the standard gypsum reimbursement agreement including failure by standard gypsum to satisfy the reimbursement obligation from the letter of credit drawings 
in the event of a default  the lender under the standard gypsum facility would be entitled to draw under the letter of credit to satisfy our support obligations  and we would then be obligated to reimburse our senior lenders for the amount of such drawing 
our failure to renew  extend or otherwise replace this letter of credit would also constitute an event of default under the standard gypsum reimbursement agreement  as would certain events of default with respect to debt arrangements of premier boxboard or temple inland 
standard gypsum intends to enter into a new credit facility  the proceeds of which would be applied to satisfy the outstanding letter of credit reimbursement obligations 
in the event that standard gypsum is unable to obtain a new credit facility or any alternate liquidity arrangement for the repayment of the reimbursement obligations  the lender under the standard gypsum facility would be entitled to draw under the million letter of credit to satisfy our support obligations  and we would then be obligated to reimburse our senior lenders for the amount of such drawing 

table of contents as of december   premier boxboard was the borrower under a credit facility with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of thousand consisting solely of an undrawn letter of credit 
on january   premier boxboard s revolving credit facility expired 
the only outstanding obligation under the facility at the time of expiration was the thousand letter of credit balance  which will remain outstanding until june  we are severally obligated for of premier boxboard s obligations with respect to this letter of credit  or thousand 
funding for premier boxboard is generated by its internal cash flow and any cash contributions that we and our joint venture partner are permitted to make 
premier boxboard generated sufficient cash flow in to pay down the remaining million revolving loan balance under the credit facility and distribute million  million to us and million to our joint venture partner 
based on the cash flows and expected future cash flows  we do not expect premier boxboard to require external funding in the foreseeable future 
however  if premier boxboard were to require additional funding and we are unable to satisfy the funding requirements  its performance could be adversely affected 
in the event that we were called upon to reimburse drawings under either or both of our joint venture letter of credit support obligations  we believe that we would be able to satisfy such obligations by having our senior lenders treat these reimbursement obligations as revolving credit loans under our senior credit agreement 
the full million of these letter of credit obligations and other letter of credit obligations outstanding as of december  has already been included in determining the million in borrowing availability under our senior credit facility as of december  our cash on hand is also a potential source of repayment of some or all of these reimbursement obligations 
however  we can give no assurance that we will be able to obtain  on a timely basis  the renewals  extensions or refinancings necessary to avoid being called upon to satisfy either or both of our joint venture support obligations  or that we will be able to reimburse our senior lenders in the event of drawings under one or both of the letters of credit 
any resulting acceleration and default in repayment of these support obligations could cause defaults and acceleration under our senior subordinated notes  our senior notes and our senior notes 
in addition to the general default risks discussed above with respect to the joint ventures  a substantial portion of the assets of premier boxboard are pledged as security for million in outstanding principal amount of senior notes under which premier boxboard is the obligor 
these notes are guaranteed by temple inland  but are not guaranteed by us 
in the event of a default under these notes  the holders would also have recourse to the assets of premier boxboard that are pledged to secure these notes 
thus  any resulting default under these notes could result in the assets of premier boxboard being utilized to satisfy creditor claims  which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operations of premier boxboard and  accordingly  our interest in premier boxboard 
as described below under subsequent events  certain technical events of default occurred under these notes as a result of certain corporate restructuring actions taken in december premier boxboard has obtained a waiver of these events of default from all of the holders of these notes and amended the premier boxboard senior note agreement to permit the restructuring effective january  additional contingencies relating to our joint ventures that could affect our liquidity include possible additional capital contributions and buy sell triggers which  under certain circumstances  give us and our joint venture partner either the right  or the obligation  to purchase the other s interest or to sell an interest to the other 
in the case of both standard gypsum and premier boxboard  neither joint venture partner is obligated or required to make additional capital contributions without the consent of both partners 
with regard to buy sell rights  under the standard gypsum joint venture  in general  either party may purchase the other s interest upon the occurrence of certain unauthorized transfers or involuntary transfer events such as bankruptcy 
in addition  under the standard gypsum joint venture  either i in the event of an unresolved deadlock over a material matter or ii at any time  either party may initiate a russian roulette buyout procedure by which it names a price at which the other party must agree either to sell its interest to the initiating party or to purchase the initiating party s interest 
under the premier boxboard joint venture  in general  mutual buy sell rights are triggered upon the occurrence of certain unauthorized or involuntary transfers  but in the event of certain change of control or deadlock events  the buy sell rights are structured such that we are always the party entitled  or obligated  as the case may be  to purchase 

table of contents we generally consider our relationship with temple inland to be good with respect to both of our joint ventures and currently do not anticipate experiencing material liquidity events resulting from either additional capital contributions or buy sell contingencies with respect to our joint ventures during however  as described above  we could be required to fund premier boxboard s operations with additional cash contributions to the extent it is unable to fund operations with internally generated cash 
we cannot give assurance that material liquidity events will not arise with respect to our joint ventures  and the occurrence of any such events could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest payment obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the long term debt obligation included in this table represents the principal amount to be paid in future periods 
the amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheet include realized interest rate swap gains and the mark to market value of interest rate swaps 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
other long term liabilities excludes future pension liabilities  other postretirement benefit liabilities and deferred compensation benefit liabilities 
for the purposes of this table  purchase obligations included in the table above are agreements for purchase of goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on caraustar and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transactions 
however  this table does not include the aggregate amount of routine purchase orders outstanding as of december   because they are not enforceable and legally binding 
cash from operations 
cash generated from operations was million for the year ended december   compared with million in the decline in operating cash flow from to is due to the following factors a million increase in inventories in compared with a million decrease in inventories in resulted in a year over year decrease in operating cash flow of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of management initiatives to reduce inventory which occurred in the increase in inventory in was primarily the result of higher sales and volume 
an million increase in accounts receivable in compared with a million decrease in resulted in a year over year decrease in operating cash flow of million 
the increase in was primarily the result of higher sales 
an million federal tax refund was received in the first quarter of no refunds were received in partially offsetting the factors above was an improvement in operating results combined with the following we made an million payment towards our pension liability in no payments were made in 
table of contents an increase in accrued liabilities in of approximately million compared with a million decrease in resulted in a year over year increase in operating cash flow of approximately million 
an increase in accrued compensation in of approximately million compared with a million decrease in resulted in a year over year increase in operating cash flow of approximately million 
if the management initiatives to reduce inventory and accounts receivable and increase accounts payable had not been successfully executed  cash from operations would have been significantly lower in management believes that cash from operations in is more indicative of expected future cash flows because of diminishing returns from the working capital initiatives initiated in in addition to the working capital reductions achieved in  we also received federal income tax refunds of million in the years and unless federal tax laws are enacted to extend the federal net operating loss carry back period  it is unlikely we will receive additional refunds in the future 
as of december  we had net federal operating losses of million that could be carried back in the event such tax laws are enacted 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million in versus million in aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million are anticipated for acquisitions 
in april  we acquired the remaining of the outstanding stock of design tubes company limited design tubes  toronto  ontario  canada in consideration for shares of a subsidiary exchangeable at the holder s option for no additional consideration for approximately thousand shares of our common stock  valued at million 
we originally acquired our minority interest in design tubes in november and accounted for our ownership using the equity method 
design tubes manufactures paperboard tubes and also produces paper tube manufacturing equipment for companies throughout north america 
goodwill in the amount of million was recorded in connection with the design tubes acquisition 
on september   we acquired certain operating assets excluding accounts receivable of the smurfit industrial packaging group  a business unit of jefferson smurfit corporation us  for approximately million  and assumed million of indebtedness outstanding under certain industrial revenue bonds 
the acquisition was funded with cash on hand 
goodwill and intangible assets of approximately million were recorded in conjunction with the smurfit industrial packaging group acquisition 
smurfit industrial packaging group operations included paper tube and core plants  uncoated recycled paperboard mills and partition manufacturing plants 
these facilities are located in states across the us and in canada 
dividends 
in february  we announced that we would suspend future dividend payments on our common stock until our earnings performance and cash flow performance improve 
as described under liquidity and capital resources  our debt agreements contain certain limitations on the payment of dividends and currently preclude us from doing so 
inflation raw material and energy cost changes have had  and continue to have  a material negative effect on our operations 
we do not believe that general economic inflation is a significant determinant of our raw material and energy cost increases or that it has a material effect on our operations 
subsequent event certain technical events of default occurred with respect to million in outstanding senior notes of our premier boxboard joint venture as a result of corporate restructuring actions taken in december premier boxboard has obtained a waiver of these events of default from all of the holders of these notes 
additionally  to the extent these events of default may have triggered cross defaults under our senior credit facility we have obtained waivers of any such cross defaults and amended the premier boxboard senior note agreement to permit the restructuring effective january
