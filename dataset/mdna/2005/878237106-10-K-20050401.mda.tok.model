item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a asset management 
while we sell products in various countries throughout the world  and product categories may vary from region to region  over the past three years  sales within our consolidated product categories have remained fairly consistent within the following ranges peripherals systems networking software we generated approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal from products purchased from hp compared to  and of consolidated net sales in fiscal and hp continues to sell products directly to end users and or resellers in certain product categories  customer segments and or geographies 
while our historical net sales have been adversely affected by this trend  which has been primarily focused on hp s computer systems business  the impact on the results of our current fiscal year has been minimal 
hp continues to modify certain contract terms and conditions  which may push additional costs into the channel 
in response to these changes  we will continue to evaluate and modify our pricing policies and terms and conditions with our customers  as well as pursue other vendor and product categories 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in lessening the impact of these changes on our future results 
in addition to hp  microsoft software accounted for of our net sales in fiscal there were no other vendors that accounted for or more of our consolidated net sales in fiscal   or customers and services we purchase products directly from manufacturers and publishers in large quantities for sale to an active reseller base of more than  vars  direct marketers  retailers  corporate resellers and internet resellers and 
while we sell products in various countries throughout the world  and customer channels may vary from region to region  over the past three years  sales within our consolidated customer channels have remained fairly consistent within the following ranges vars direct marketers  retailers and internet resellers corporate resellers no single customer accounted for more than five percent of our net sales during fiscal   or the market for vars is attractive because vars generally rely on distributors as their principal source of computer products and financing 
this reliance is due to vars typically lacking the resources to establish a large number of direct purchasing relationships or stock significant product inventories 
direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers may establish direct relationships with manufacturers and publishers for their more popular products  but utilize distributors as the primary source for other product requirements and the alternative source for products acquired directly 
we have also developed special programs to meet the unique needs of direct marketers  retailers and internet resellers 
in addition to a strong product offering  we provide resellers a high level of customer service through our pre and post sale technical support  suite of electronic commerce tools including internet order entry and edi services  customized shipping documents  product configuration integration services and access to flexible financing programs 
we also provide services to our vendors by giving them the opportunity to participate in a number of special promotions  training programs and marketing services targeted to the needs of our resellers 
while we believe that services such as these help to set us apart from our competition  they contribute less than to our overall revenues 
we provide our vendors one of the largest bases of resellers throughout the americas and emea  delivering products to customers from our regionally located logistics centers 
locating logistics centers near our customers enables us to deliver products on a timely basis  thereby reducing the customers need to invest in inventory see also item properties for further discussion of our locations and logistics centers 
sales and electronic commerce currently  our sales force consists of approximately  field and inside telemarketing sales representatives 
field sales representatives are located in major metropolitan areas 
each field sales representative is supported by inside telemarketing sales teams covering a designated territory 
our team concept provides a strong personal relationship between representatives of the customers and tech data 
territories with no field representation are serviced exclusively by the inside telemarketing sales teams 
customers typically call their inside sales teams on dedicated toll free numbers or contact us through various electronic methods to place orders 
if the product is in stock and the customer has available credit  customer orders are generally shipped the same day from the logistics center nearest the customer 
increasingly  customers rely upon our electronic ordering and information systems  in addition to our product catalogs and frequent mailings  as sources for product information  including availability and price 
our on line computer systems allows the inside sales teams to check current stocking levels in the company s logistics centers 
through our website  most customers can gain remote access to our information systems to check product availability and pricing and to place orders 
certain of our larger customers have edi services available whereby orders  order acknowledgments  invoices  inventory status reports  customized pricing information and other industry standard edi transactions are consummated on line  which improves efficiency and timeliness for ourselves and our customers 
during fiscal  approximately billion of our consolidated sales originated from orders received electronically  compared to approximately billion in fiscal we also provide comprehensive training to our field and inside telemarketing sales representatives regarding our policies and procedures and technical characteristics of products 
in addition  these training programs are supplemented by product seminars offered by manufacturers and publishers 
competition we operate in a market characterized by intense competition  based upon such factors as product availability  credit availability  price  delivery and various services and support provided by the distributor to the customer 
we believe that we are well equipped to compete effectively with other distributors in all of these areas 
we compete against several distributors in the americas market  including ingram micro inc  synnex corporation  and several regional and local distributors 
the competitive environment within emea is highly fragmented  with market share spread among many regional and local competitors such as actebis  and international distributors such as ingram micro and westcon comstor 
we also compete  in some cases  with manufacturers and publishers who sell directly to resellers and end users 
however  we may become a business partner to these companies by providing supply chain or other services tailored to the it market 
we believe manufacturers and publishers will continue to sell their products through distributors rather than directly due to our ability to provide suppliers with access to our broad customer base in a highly efficient manner 
our network of logistics centers and our sales and product management expertise worldwide allow our suppliers to benefit by lowering their selling and inventory costs 
employees on january   we had approximately  employees located as follows americas  and emea  certain of our employees in various countries outside of the united states are subject to laws providing representation rights to employees on management boards 
we consider relations with our employees to be good 
foreign and domestic operations and export sales we operate predominately in a single industry segment as a distributor of it products  logistics management  and other value added services 
while we operate primarily in one industry  because of our global presence  we manage our business based on our geographic segments 
starting in the first quarter of fiscal  we modified our management structure and combined our us  canadian and latin american operations into the americas region 
our canadian and latin american operations were previously reported separately as the other international region 
as a result  our geographic segments include the americas united states  canada  latin america and export sales to the caribbean and emea europe  middle east  and export sales to africa 
fiscal amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
in fiscal   and   and  respectively  of our total net sales were derived outside of the united states 
over the last three fiscal years  we have entered new markets or expanded our presence in existing markets and exited certain markets based upon our assessment of  among other factors  risk and earnings potential 
such actions included our acquisition of azlan during the first quarter of fiscal  for approximately million plus acquisition related expenses of million  for a total purchase price of million 
the sale of our baltics operations estonia  latvia and lithuania at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal for their approximate book value of million 
the closure of our operations in norway and hungary during the first half of fiscal operating losses incurred during the wind down of these operations totaled less than million  which has been reflected in operating income during fiscal the sale of our operations in argentina to local management and the liquidation of one of our european financing subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of fiscal with respect to the argentina transaction  we recorded a charge of approximately million on the sale  in addition to the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange losses previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in connection with the liquidation of the european financing subsidiary  we repatriated approximately million of capital  which resulted in the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange gains previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the net effect of these transactions resulted in a total pre tax loss of approximately million  recorded within loss on disposition of subsidiaries in the fiscal consolidated statement of income 
we continue to evaluate our risk exposure eg  risks surrounding currency rates  regulatory environments  political instability  etc 
and earnings potential around the world 
to the extent we decide to close additional operations  we may incur charges and operating losses related to such closures  as well as recognize a portion of our accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a non operating foreign currency exchange gain or loss see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the geographical distribution of our net sales  operating income and identifiable assets

overview tech data is a leading global provider of information technology it products  logistics management and other value added services 
we distribute microcomputer hardware and software products to value added resellers  corporate resellers  retailers  direct marketers and internet resellers 
our offering of value added customer services includes pre and post sale training and technical support  external financing options  configuration services  outbound telemarketing  marketing services and a suite of electronic commerce solutions 
we manage our business in two geographic segments the americas which includes the united states  canada  latin america and export sales to the caribbean and emea which includes europe  the middle east and export sales to africa 
similar to other companies in the technology industry  our fiscal results were negatively affected by the economic downturn 
we responded by refining our operational practices  restructuring and implementing many other measures based on rigorous evaluation of all operations 
as a result of these efforts  our financial results began to improve during the second half of fiscal for fiscal and through fiscal  we have generated positive sales growth through the expansion of our existing operations  integration of acquisitions  the addition of new product categories and suppliers  the addition of new customers and increased sales to our existing customer base and the overall growth in the it products and services distribution industry in general 
in addition  we continue to seek new market opportunities to leverage our cost model 
on that front  we continue to advance our specialized business unit sbu model worldwide  that supports our diversification into more specialized  higher value market segments 
for example  our acquisition of azlan group plc azlan at the end of march enhanced our european presence in the high end networking space 
our consolidated net sales increased from billion in fiscal  to billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal our strategy is to leverage our highly efficient cost structure combined with our multiple service offerings to generate demand and cost efficiencies for our suppliers and customers around the world 
the it distribution industry in which we operate is characterized by narrow gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin and narrow income from operations as a percentage of sales operating margin 
historically  our gross and operating margins have been impacted by intense price competition  as well as changes in terms and conditions with our suppliers  including those terms related to rebates and other incentives and price protection 
we do not foresee any abatement of these issues in the near future  and therefore  we will continue to evaluate our pricing policies and terms and conditions offered to our customers in response to changes in our vendors terms and conditions and the general market environment 
as we continue to evaluate our existing pricing policies and make future changes  if any  we may experience moderated or negative sales growth 
in addition  increased competition and changes in general economic conditions within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to maintain and or improve gross margin from its current level 
in general  we believe we have responded to the market changes appropriately  through our focus on superior execution  cost management and disciplined pricing practices  which is reflected in the value we provide to our customers 
we continue to improve our operating efficiencies through the sharing of best practices  streamlining of processes  and strategically investing in our internal systems 
these improvements are evidenced by our continuing investments in upgrading and expanding our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers 
we continue to make significant investments to implement new it systems and upgrade our existing it infrastructure in order to meet our changing business requirements 
these implementations and upgrades occur at various levels throughout our organization and include  but are not limited to  new operating and enterprise systems  financial systems  internet technologies  customer relationship management systems and telecommunications 
from a balance sheet perspective  we require working capital primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we have historically relied upon debt  trade credit from our vendors  and accounts receivable financing programs for our working capital needs 
our balance sheet at january   was one of the strongest in the industry  with a debt to capital ratio of 
critical accounting policies and estimates the information included within md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  vendor incentives  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  and contingencies 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results  and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio  the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks 
also influencing our estimates are the following the large number of customers and their dispersion across wide geographic areas  the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of our net sales  and the value and adequacy of collateral received from customers  if any 
if actual customer performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected by us  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of its cost or market value  with cost being determined on the first in first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence and the nature of vendor terms surrounding price protection and product returns  foreign currency fluctuations for foreign sourced product and assumptions about future demand 
market conditions or changes in terms and conditions by our vendors that are less favorable than those projected by management may require additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  personnel funding  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors  however  some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed with the vendor 
we have historically recorded unrestricted volume rebates and early payment discounts received from vendors as a reduction of inventory and recognized the incentives as a reduction of cost of products sold when the related inventory was sold 
with the implementation of emerging issues task force no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf issue no 
 such treatment is also applicable for all other incentives we receive from vendors  such as cooperative advertising allowances and personnel funding 
the impact of the implementation of eitf issue no 
is discussed within the results of operations section of this document 
goodwill and intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and may also be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
we also examine the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives  which includes capitalized software and development costs and purchased intangibles  as current events and circumstances warrant determining whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present in intangible assets used in operations and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
factors that may cause a goodwill or intangible asset impairment include negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of recorded valuation allowances  we consider a variety of factors including  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine we would be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
however  the recognition of any future tax benefit resulting from the reduction of the million valuation allowance associated with the purchase of azlan would be recorded as a reduction in goodwill 
should we determine that we are unable to use all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include tax  legal and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports  which are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process

in addition  microsoft software accounted for of our net sales in fiscal there were no other manufacturers and publishers that accounted for or more of our net sales in the past three years 
the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of income as a percentage of net sales for each of the three most recent fiscal years net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges operating income loss loss on disposition of subsidiaries  net interest expense interest income net foreign currency exchange gain income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net sales during fiscal  we saw our consolidated net sales grow to billion  a increase over fiscal this growth can be attributed to strong demand in both the americas and emea 
our performance within emea was further enhanced by the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar  which contributed approximately half of the sales growth we reported in the region 
our sales growth in emea was also positively impacted by fiscal including twelve months of operations of azlan compared to including only ten months of operations in fiscal azlan  one of the leading european distributors of networking and communications equipment  was acquired by tech data in march our legacy operations ie  excluding azlan in emea also experienced sales growth in the high single digits  reflecting the strong demand for it products during the year 
the improvement in our sales performance in fiscal actually began during the second semester of fiscal  within both the americas and our legacy emea operations 
this positive growth can be attributed to an improvement in general market demand during the second half of fiscal in both regions 
our sales performance also reflects our strategy to maintain our market share position with certain customers and or vendors  while still achieving acceptable profit margins 
consolidated net sales were billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal our net sales within the americas declined on a year over year basis in fiscal in comparison to fiscal the vast majority of this decline took place within the united states  where our performance was adversely affected by the general economic slowdown  the effect of highly competitive market conditions within the distribution industry and the direct sales efforts of certain vendors 
our net sales within emea increased on a year over year basis in in comparison to fiscal for fiscal  this increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of azlan and the stronger euro versus the us dollar 
our legacy emea operations experienced a slight year over year decrease in net sales on a local currency basis during fiscal our year over year decline in net sales during fiscal in our legacy emea operations on a local currency basis was primarily due to the impact of lower demand for technology products and services during the first half of this year and our exit last year from certain markets in emea  more than offsetting the positive growth we saw during the second half of fiscal gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin during fiscal was  compared to in fiscal  a decrease of 
of net sales  or two basis points 
this decrease is the result of the highly competitive pricing environment in both the americas and emea  partially offset by an additional basis points of vendor consideration reclassified as a reduction of cost of goods sold in fiscal compared to  in accordance with eitf issue no 
the requirements of eitf issue no 
and its impact on our financial results are further discussed below 
in addition to the impact of eitf issue no 
 the inclusion of a full twelve months of azlan s results which generates higher gross margins than our legacy operations in fiscal compared to ten months in fiscal also positively affected our gross margin comparisons on a year over year basis  however this impact was far less than the impact of eitf issue no 
excluding the effect of eitf issue no 
and azlan  our legacy operations in both the americas and emea experienced year over year declines in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal this decline  which is most pronounced in the americas  reflects the continued highly competitive pricing environment and our desire to maintain our market share position 
while we experienced a year over year decline in gross margin during fiscal  we were pleased with the improvement we showed at the operating margin level  especially within emea 
we continue to evaluate our pricing policies and terms and conditions offered to our customers in response to changes in our vendors terms and conditions and the general market environment 
as we continue to evaluate our existing pricing policies and make future changes  if any  we may experience moderated or negative sales growth 
in addition  increased competition and changes in general economic conditions within the markets we conduct business may hinder our ability to maintain and or improve gross margin from its current level 
gross margin increased basis points in fiscal to  compared to in fiscal the increase in gross margin during fiscal is largely the result of the inclusion of the operating results of azlan and the impact of our adoption of eitf issue no 
 offset by declining gross margins in our legacy operations 
absent the impact of eitf issue no 
and azlan  our legacy operations experienced a year over year decline in gross margins during fiscal compared to fiscal due to the highly competitive pricing environment  especially in the americas 
as discussed above  our gross margin was positively impacted by the implementation of eitf issue no 
 that requires  under certain circumstances  consideration received from vendors be treated as a reduction of cost of goods sold and not as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
eitf issue no 
further requires the recognition of such consideration be deferred until the related inventory is sold 
as the guidance was applicable only to vendor arrangements entered into or modified subsequent to december   it was effective for all vendor arrangements throughout fiscal  however  it had only a partial impact during fiscal fiscal was not impacted by eitf issue no 

this had the effect of increasing our reported gross margin by 
of net sales  or basis points  in fiscal compared to basis points in fiscal see table below 
as of january   we have deferred approximately million of such vendor consideration offsetting inventory on the balance sheet pending sale of the related inventory 
going forward  we do not expect there to be material deviations in our deferral for vendor consideration received  however  the actual deferred amounts recorded will be based on the nature and amount of vendor funding received and related quarter end inventory levels 
similarly  to the extent there are no material changes to our future vendor agreements  of which no assurance can be made  we would expect the relative impact on gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses in basis points in future periods to be in the range of that experienced during fiscal as noted above  fiscal was not impacted by eitf issue no 
the following table highlights the impact of eitf issue no on our reported gross and operating margins for fiscal years and in thousands year ended january  impact of reclassification increase in selling  general and administrative expenses decrease in cost of goods sold increase decrease in operating income gross margin as reported before adjustment for eitf issue no 
increase in gross margin operating margin as reported before adjustment for eitf issue no 
decrease increase in operating margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this decrease is the result of continuing costs savings initiatives and improvements in productivity  offset in part by the effects of eitf issue no 
in absolute dollars  sg a increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is attributable to the continued strengthening of the euro against the us dollar and the implementation of eitf issue no 
 as discussed above 
excluding these factors  sg a actually declined in fiscal compared to fiscal we achieved this level of sg a expenses through our constant monitoring of costs  including tight budgetary controls and productivity reviews 
these productivity reviews result in a highly variable cost model with an ability to better respond to changes in market demand compared to those companies with high fixed costs 
these productivity reviews have also allowed us to deliver solid sales growth in the americas and in emea on a euro basis while decreasing our average headcount during the year 
based on a simple average of quarter end headcount  our average headcount in fiscal was approximately  compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  sg a increased by  or million from the prior year 
similar to the increase in net sales and gross profit  the increase in sg a for fiscal year can be attributed primarily to the inclusion of the results from azlan  the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  and our adoption of eitf issue no 
also impacting our sg a this year are the project and operating costs we have incurred for the harmonization and upgrade of our european systems infrastructure 
such costs expensed during fiscal approximated million compared to million in the prior year fiscal costs approximated million 
excluding the above factors  sg a incurred by our legacy operations actually declined from fiscal to fiscal on a local currency basis 
this sg a performance would have been more favorable had we not incurred charges this year associated with workforce reductions in excess of the amount incurred in the prior year 
special charges during fiscal  we incurred special charges of million  or 
of net sales  related to the closure of our education business in the united states and the restructuring of this business to a more variable cost based  outsourced model 
these charges primarily include costs associated with employee severance  facility lease terminations and the write offs of fixed assets associated with the business 
during fiscal  operating income was negatively affected by a million impairment to goodwill resulting from the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
revised the standards of accounting for goodwill by replacing the amortization of these assets with the requirement that they be reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual test of goodwill to determine if there was impairment 
this testing included the determination of each reporting unit s fair value using market multiples and discounted cash flows modeling 
our reduced earnings and cash flow forecast  primarily due to the prolonged downturn in the economy  uncertain demand  and competitive industry conditions  resulted in the determination that a goodwill impairment charge was necessary 
the million non cash charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in performing the annual test for goodwill impairment for fiscal and fiscal  we determined there was no impairment 
loss on disposition of subsidiaries during fiscal  as a result of currency related issues  political instability and continued economic concerns in the country  we decided to sell our operations in argentina to local management 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we liquidated one of our european financing subsidiaries 
with respect to the argentina transaction  we recorded a charge of approximately million on the sale  in addition to the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange losses previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in connection with the liquidation of the european financing subsidiary  we repatriated approximately million of capital  which resulted in the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange gains previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the net effect of these transactions resulted in a total pre tax loss of approximately million  recorded within loss on disposition of subsidiaries in the fiscal consolidated statement of income 
interest expense  interest income  foreign currency exchange gains interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense is primarily due to additional working capital requirements resulting from higher sales volume  as well as a higher interest rate environment in the us in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash available for investment in fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we redeemed our million  convertible subordinated debentures during the fourth quarter of fiscal the million debentures  scheduled to mature on july   were redeemed at a price of or million 
this redemption allowed us to take advantage of the current lower interest rate environment 
the debt instruments we utilized during fiscal were at lower interest rates as compared to the redeemed debentures  and accordingly  resulted in significantly lower interest expense 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this reduction was primarily due to the use of excess cash to reduce debt and to fund a portion of the azlan acquisition in march we realized net foreign currency exchange gains of million  million and million during the fiscal years    and  respectively 
we recognize net foreign currency exchange gains and losses primarily due to the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar versus the euro  and to a lesser extent  versus other currencies 
it continues to be our goal to minimize foreign currency exchange gains and losses through an effective hedging program 
additionally  our hedging policy prohibits speculative foreign currency exchange transactions 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the change in effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the reversal of previously accrued income taxes of million due to the favorable resolution of various income tax examinations during the fourth quarter of fiscal excluding the reversal of previously accrued income taxes  our effective tax rate would have approximated during fiscal due to an increase in our taxable income  the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the change in effective tax rate was primarily due to non deductible special charges recognized during fiscal due to a decrease in our taxable income before special charges  the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the effective tax rates are also impacted by favorable tax audit results  cumulative and current period net operating losses in certain geographic regions  and management s assessment of the related deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
at january   we believe we have appropriately accrued for probable income tax exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
net income and earnings per share as a result of the factors described above  net income increased to million in fiscal  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal and a net loss of million  or per diluted share in fiscal excluding the reversal of previously accrued income taxes  as discussed above  net income would have been million or per diluted share in fiscal excluding special charges and the loss on disposition of subsidiaries  net income decreased to million  or per diluted share in fiscal compared to per diluted share in fiscal non gaap financial information for the fiscal years  and  the following reconciliations detail the adjustments between results calculated using generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the same results reported excluding the reversal of previously accrued income taxes  special charges  the loss on disposition of subsidiaries and related tax effects non gaap information 
the non gaap information is included with the intention of providing investors a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results and trends  but should only be used in conjunction with results reported in accordance with gaap amounts in thousands except per share amounts fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended january  for the year ended january  as reported under gaap impact of reversal of previously accrued income taxes non gaap financial measures as reported under gaap impact of special charges non gaap financial measures net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges operating income interest expense interest income net foreign currency exchange gains income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net income per common share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding diluted fiscal compared to fiscal for the year ended january  for the year ended january  as reported under gaap impact of special charges non gaap financial measures as reported under gaap impact of special charges and loss on dispositions non gaap financial measures net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges operating income loss loss on disposition of subsidiaries  net interest expense interest income net foreign currency exchange gains income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net income loss per common share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding diluted see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for shares excluded from the eps calculation due to their anti dilutive effect

tax effect of non gaap adjustments 
goodwill impairment recorded in fiscal loss on sale of argentina offset by the gain on liquidation of a european financing subsidiary 
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the microcomputer industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline 
management believes that most price increases could be passed on to our customers  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our customers 
quarterly data seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of currency fluctuations and seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results 
specific historical seasonal variations have included a reduction of demand in europe during the summer months and an increase in european demand during our fiscal fourth quarter 
the product cycle of major products and any company acquisition or disposition may also materially impact our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes tech data s consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended january   and in thousands years ended january  net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to the timing of payments to vendors  offset in part by  increased earnings over the prior year especially within our emea segment 
we continue to focus on maintaining strong working capital management and have several key metrics we use to manage our working capital  including our cash conversion cycle also referred to as net cash days and owned inventory levels 
our net cash days are defined as days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso plus days of supply on hand in inventory dos  less days purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo 
owned inventory is calculated as the difference between our inventory and accounts payable balances divided into the inventory balance 
our net cash days improved by approximately to days at the end of fiscal compared to days at the end of fiscal  resulting from improved management of our worldwide cash conversion cycle 
our owned inventory level the percentage of inventory not financed by vendors was a negative at the end of fiscal  meaning our accounts payable balances exceeded our inventory balances by 
this compares to negative owned inventory of at the end of fiscal net cash provided by operating activities increased for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to net income of million in fiscal compared to a net loss of million in fiscal as well as the positive effect of our focus on working capital management 
our owned inventory level was a negative at the end of fiscal  compared to a negative owned inventory of at the end of fiscal at the end of fiscal  our net cash days were days compared to days at the end of fiscal the following table presents the components of tech data s cash conversion cycle as of january   and for the years ended january  days of sales outstanding days of supply in inventory days of purchases outstanding cash conversion cycle net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was attributable to the continuing investment related to the expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers  offset by the proceeds from the sale of one of the facilities at our headquarters campus in clearwater  florida 
we expect to make total capital expenditures of approximately to million during fiscal to further expand or upgrade our it systems  logistics centers and office facilities 
we continue to make significant investments to implement new it systems and upgrade our existing it infrastructure in order to meet our changing business requirements 
these implementations and upgrades occur at various levels throughout our organization and include  but are not limited to  new operating and enterprise systems  financial systems  internet technologies  customer relationship management systems and telecommunications 
while we believe we will realize increased operating efficiencies as a result of these investments  unforeseen circumstances or complexities could have an adverse impact on our business 
net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was primarily attributable to the acquisition of azlan and the continuing investment related to the expansion of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers  which included million in capitalized costs related to harmonizing and upgrading our european systems infrastructure 
net cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal reflects million in proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan espp offset by net repayments on our revolving credit lines and long term debt of million 
net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal reflects the use of in cash used to pay down revolving credit facilities and principal payments on long term debt offset by million in proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases made through our espp 
as of january   we maintained a million multi currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires in may we pay interest average rate of at january  under this facility at the applicable euro rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings 
additionally  we maintained a million receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks 
we pay interest average rate of at january  on the receivables securitization program at designated commercial paper rates plus an agreed upon margin 
in addition to these credit facilities  we maintained lines of credit and overdraft facilities totaling approximately million at january  average interest rate on borrowings was at january  
the aforementioned credit facilities total approximately billion  of which million was outstanding at january  these credit facilities contain covenants that must be complied with on a continuous basis  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios  restrictions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the amount of common stock that may be repurchased annually 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of january  the ability to draw funds under these credit facilities is dependent upon sufficient collateral in the case of the receivables securitization program and meeting the aforementioned financial covenants  which limits our ability to draw the full amount of these facilities 
for example  our total borrowings on certain credit facilities are limited to a multiple of our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda recognized during the last twelve months 
the ebitda calculation within our covenants allows for certain special charges  such as goodwill impairments  to be excluded 
as of january   the maximum amount that could be borrowed under these facilities  in consideration of the availability of collateral and the financial covenants  was approximately million 
in addition  at january   we had issued standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
the issuance of these letters of credit reduces our available capacity under our credit agreements by the same amount 
for a more detailed discussion of our credit facilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on march   we amended our revolving credit facility the amended credit agreement to extend the maturity date to march  and modify existing covenants 
under the terms of the amended credit agreement  we are able to borrow funds in major foreign currencies up to a maximum of million 
we pay interest on advances under this new facility at the applicable euro rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings and we can fix the interest rate for periods of to days 
the amended credit agreement requires us to meet certain covenants with respect to our debt to capitalization ratio  interest charge coverage ratio and tangible net worth 
we are also required to provide a pledge of stock or a guarantee of certain significant subsidiaries as defined in the amended credit agreement 
the covenant discussed previously  regarding the limitation on total borrowings based upon a multiple of our ebitda  has been excluded from the amended credit agreement 
our receivables securitization program and synthetic lease facility also require compliance with the covenants and pledge of stock or guarantee discussed above 
these agreements were also amended in march to conform the covenant requirements with those contained in the amended credit agreement 
in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures bear interest at per year and are convertible into our common stock at any time  if the market price of the common stock exceeds a specified percentage of the conversion price per share of common stock  beginning at and declining each year until it reaches at maturity  or in other specified instances 
holders may convert debentures into shares per  principal amount of debentures  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock 
holders have the option to require us to repurchase the debentures on any of the fourth  eighth  twelfth or sixteenth anniversary dates from the issue date at of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the repurchase date 
we have the option to satisfy such repurchases in either cash and or our common stock  provided that shares of common stock at the first purchase date will be valued at of fair market value as defined in the indenture and at of fair market value for all subsequent purchase dates 
the debentures are redeemable in whole or in part for cash  at our option at any time on or after december  we will pay contingent interest on the debentures during specified six month periods beginning on december   if the market price of the debentures exceeds specified levels 
in december we completed an exchange offer whereby we exchanged approximately of our million convertible subordinated debentures for new debentures the new notes 
the new notes have substantially identical terms to the previously outstanding convertible subordinated debentures except for the following modifications a a net share settlement feature that provides that holders will receive  upon redemption  cash for the principal amount of the new notes and stock for any remaining amount due  b an adjustment to the conversion rate upon payment of cash dividends or distributions as well as a modification to the options available to the new note holders in the event of a change in control  and c a modification to the calculation of contingent interest payable  if any 
the dilutive impact of the new notes is excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculations due to the conditions for the contingent conversion feature not being met 
as the holders of the debentures have the option to require us to repurchase the debentures on certain dates  beginning with december  we have classified the debentures as a current liability at january  in august  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec for million of debt and equity securities 
the net proceeds from any issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  the repayment or refinancing of debt and to meet working capital needs 
as of january   we had not issued any debt or equity securities under this registration statement  nor can any assurances be given that we will issue any debt or equity securities under this registration statement in the future 
our balance sheet at january  was one of the strongest in our history as evidenced by a senior debt to capital ratio of and a total debt to capital ratio of 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under our credit arrangements  will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and future working capital and cash requirements for at least the next months 
contractual obligations principal maturities of long term debt and amounts due under future minimum lease payments  including minimum commitments under it outsourcing agreements  are as follows operating leases capital leases long term debt total in thousands fiscal year thereafter total payments less amounts representing interest total principal payments purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on tech data and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current demand expectations and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease facility on july   we completed a restructuring of our synthetic lease facility with a group of financial institutions the restructured lease under which we lease certain logistics centers and office facilities from a third party lessor 
the restructured lease expires in  at which time we have the following options renew the lease for an additional five years  purchase the properties at an amount equal to their cost  or remarket the properties 
if we elect to remarket the properties  we have guaranteed the lessor a percentage of the cost of each of the properties  in an aggregate amount of approximately million 
at any time during the lease term  we may  at our option  purchase up to four of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each property s cost 
the restructured lease contains covenants that must be complied with on a continuous basis  similar to the covenants described in certain of the credit facilities discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet  the amount funded under the restructured lease is treated as debt under the definition of the covenants required for both the restructured lease and the significant credit facilities referred to in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
as previously discussed  in march  we amended the restructured lease to conform the covenant requirements with those contained in the amended credit agreement 
the restructured lease is fully funded at january   in the approximate amount of million 
the sum of future minimum lease payments under the restructured lease at january  was approximately million 
properties leased under the restructured lease facility total million square feet of space  with land totaling acres located in clearwater and miami  florida  fort worth  texas  fontana  california  suwanee  georgia  swedesboro  new jersey  and south bend  indiana 
the restructured lease has been accounted for as an operating lease 
financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
requires us to evaluate whether an entity with which we are involved meets the criteria of a variable interest entity vie and  if so  whether we are required to consolidate that entity 
we have determined that the third party lessor of the synthetic lease facility does not meet the criteria of a vie and  therefore  is not subject to the consolidation provisions of fin no 
guarantees as is customary in the it industry  to encourage certain customers to purchase product from us  we have arrangements with certain finance companies that provide inventory financing facilities for our customers 
in conjunction with certain of these arrangements  we have agreements with the finance companies that would require us to repurchase certain inventory  which might be repossessed from the customers by the finance companies 
due to various reasons  including among other items  the lack of information regarding the amount of saleable inventory purchased from us still on hand with the customer at any point in time  our repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated 
repurchases of inventory by us under these arrangements have been insignificant to date 
we also provide additional financial guarantees to finance companies on behalf of certain customers 
the majority of these guarantees are for an indefinite period of time  where we would be required to perform if the customer is in default with the finance company 
as of january  and  the aggregate amount of guarantees under these arrangements totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million  respectively  was outstanding 
we believe that  based on historical experience  the likelihood of a material loss pursuant to both of the above guarantees is remote 
we also provide residual value guarantees related to our restructured lease 
we sold trade receivables to a financial institution  amounting to approximately million in january the transaction was accounted for as a sale and accordingly  has been excluded from the consolidated balance sheet 
we have considered the risk of loss associated with these receivables within its assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts at january  asset management we manage our inventories by maintaining sufficient quantities to achieve high order fill rates while attempting to stock only those products in high demand with a rapid turnover rate 
inventory balances fluctuate as we add new product lines and when appropriate  we make large purchases  including cash purchases from manufacturers and publishers when the terms of such purchases are considered advantageous 
our contracts with most of our vendors provide price protection and stock rotation privileges to reduce the risk of loss due to manufacturer price reductions and slow moving or obsolete inventory 
in the event of a vendor price reduction  we generally receive a credit for the impact on products in inventory  subject to certain limitations 
in addition  we have the right to rotate a certain percentage of purchases  subject to certain limitations 
historically  price protection and stock rotation privileges as well as our inventory management procedures have helped to reduce the risk of loss of inventory value 
we attempt to control losses on credit sales by closely monitoring customers creditworthiness through our it systems  which contain detailed information on each customer s payment history and other relevant information 
we have obtained credit insurance that insures a percentage of the credit extended by us to certain customers against possible loss 
customers who qualify for credit terms are typically granted net day payment terms in the americas 
while credit terms in the emea vary by country  the vast majority of customers are granted credit terms ranging from days 
we also sell products on a prepay  credit card  cash on delivery and floor plan basis 
deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have been recorded for net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences 
our deferred tax assets relate to subsidiary operations located in different countries with separate taxing jurisdictions 
although aggregate foreign operations generate pre tax income  certain subsidiaries have incurred net operating losses 
the net change in the deferred income tax valuation allowance was an increase of million at january  the deferred tax valuation allowance at january  primarily relates to foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million 
the majority of the net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period with the remaining portion expiring in years through we evaluate a variety of factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the net change in the deferred income tax valuation allowance was an increase of million at january  with approximately million of this increase being associated with the acquisition of azlan 
to the extent the azlan acquisition related deferred tax assets are realized in future periods  such benefit would be recorded as a reduction in goodwill 
acquisitions effective march   we completed the acquisition of azlan  a european distributor of networking and communications products and provider of training and other value added services 
shareholders of azlan received pence per ordinary share  resulting in total cash consideration of approximately million pounds sterling million  which we funded from our existing credit facilities 
we subsequently incurred acquisition related expenses of approximately million for a total purchase price of million 
the azlan acquisition strengthened our position in emea with respect to networking products and value added services and was accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the net assets and results of operations of azlan have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk as a large international organization  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
it is our policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed and not to enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our primary exposure relates to transactions in emea  where the currency collected from customers is different from the currency used to purchase the product 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect our earnings and cash flows from the adverse impact of exchange rate changes 
foreign exchange risk is managed by using foreign currency forward  option and swap contracts to hedge both intercompany and third party loans  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
we have elected not to designate our foreign currency contracts as hedging instruments  and they are therefore marked to market with changes in their value recorded in the income statement each period
