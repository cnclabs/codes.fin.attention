strategy overview our current strategic initiatives to increase operating income and return maximum value to our stockholders include delivering superior value propositions the majority of our product revenue is generated from our data warehousing  financial self service and retail store automation businesses  and leveraging our market leadership and value propositions in these businesses is important to ncr s future success 
these businesses are strategically focused on gaining market share and reallocating spending to value added activities within our product offerings to generate revenue and operating income growth 
we are also making investments in research and development activities to generate new products that will further improve the value of our product offerings 
please refer to the sections in this md a discussing each of ncr s businesses for more information on these strategies 
enhancing demand creation we are investing in our sales force by hiring additional sales people and industry professionals  along with increasing our training offerings 
we expect these investments to provide meaningful benefits in and beyond 
improving profitability in customer services in our customer services division  we are driving operational and financial improvement by lowering our service delivery costs  improving the percentage of ncr atms and pos equipment which is serviced by ncr  and increasing our focus on the linkage between product engineering and product serviceability 
please refer to the customer services section in this md a for further details on these initiatives 
optimizing our cost structure in  we made significant progress on reducing our cost structure to bring it in line with industry benchmark standards 
through and  we have delivered million of the million commitment we made to reduce cost and expense 
we expect to deliver the remaining million in  as well as an additional million of cost reductions in and please refer to the restructuring and re engineering section in this md a for further details on our cost reductions efforts 
financial overview was a positive year for ncr as we showed significant progress and made several key strategic decisions in order to generate future revenue growth and operating income 
as more fully discussed in later sections of the md a  the following were the significant themes and events for we continued to strengthen the value of our products and services provided to customers around the world and increased our revenue in  including percentage points of benefit from foreign currency 
cost and expense reductions in helped improve our operating income despite million of incremental pension and severance expense compared to  and the negative affect of foreign exchange 
we produced million of cash from operations  million after million of capital expenditures 
in  we established five key value drivers in order to improve and measure our overall success 
these drivers and our results against them were as follows data warehousing revenue growth data warehousing experienced growth as companies continued to invest in the strong value proposition our teradata data warehouses provide 
foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point benefit to revenue 
financial self service revenue growth financial self service revenue grew due to strong atm sales in both the americas and emea regions and to a lesser extent in the asia pacific region 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations provided a benefit of percentage points to revenue 

table of contents retail store automation profitability retail store automation improved profitability from breakeven in to million of operating income in due to revenue growth and meaningful expense reductions 
foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point benefit to revenue 
customer services performance although we are continuing our actions to improve the financial results of this segment  the improvement in was offset by continued price erosion and a less favorable mix of high margin maintenance revenue from businesses we previously exited 
cost and expense reductions as mentioned above  we made significant progress on this value driver  reducing cost and expense by more than million in the key drivers are discussed in greater detail later in this md a 
our key drivers for will be similar to those for  and will include improving the profitability of our customer services operating segment  continuing to reduce spending to achieve optimal operating performance  and driving revenue growth in our key product segments 
we are projecting that the capital spending environment in will be about the same as what was experienced in  and are forecasting revenue to increase slightly 
we expect our operating income to increase due to higher revenues  the continued reduction of infrastructure cost  and the restructuring of our customer services business 
we see the following as the most significant risks to the execution of our initiatives capital spending and competitive environment if the overall it capital spending environment declines  or if we cannot overcome the negative effect of pricing pressure or adverse foreign exchange movement with cost reductions  we may not be able to profitably grow our business and meet our financial objectives 
executing our customer services transformation process it is critical for ncr to structure this business so that it can substantially improve profitability 
this improvement could be at risk if we cannot successfully meet our plan objectives  described in the customer services segment discussion of this md a  if we cannot overcome the negative effect of anticipated pricing pressures  or if an unforeseen event occurs that would increase the number of service incidents and therefore increase cost 
impact of pension expense changes in actuarial assumptions and declines in the capital markets for both ncr s us and international pension plans may result in more pension expense in future periods than anticipated  which could decrease our overall profitability 
while changes in actuarial assumptions may have a more immediate effect on our pension expense  changes in the capital markets may affect our net income in following years 
we are continuing to analyze all costs and employee benefits related to our current pension plans 
reduce cost if we cannot continue to remove costs and expenses from our infrastructure and business units  we may not be competitive in our pricing and may not be able to create the capacity to invest in new solutions

table of contents compared to results discussion ncr s revenue of  million for was a increase from this growth included percentage points of favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations 
please refer to the revenue and operating income loss by segment section in this md a for details regarding our segment results 
year over year revenue increased in the americas  in emea  in the asia pacific region  and decreased in japan 
changes in foreign currency rates provided a percentage point  an percentage point  a percentage point  and a percentage point benefit to revenue in the americas  emea  asia pacific  and japan  respectively 
in the americas region  the revenue growth was attributable to strong volumes in our three major product segments of financial self service  data warehousing  and retail store automation 
the growth in our emea region was primarily due to changes in foreign currency rates and increased volumes in financial self service which was offset somewhat by declines in the other segment 
in the asia pacific region  foreign currency changes primarily drove the revenue increase 
certain segments  such as financial self service  retail store automation  systemedia and data warehousing  grew beyond the currency impact in asia pacific  however  this growth was offset by volume declines in other businesses 
in japan  a volume increase in data warehousing was more than offset by declines in nearly every other segment 
income from operations in increased to million compared to million in the increase was primarily due to a combination of higher volumes in our three main product businesses  benefits from foreign currency fluctuations  and lower cost and expense 
the increase in income from operations more than offset the increase in pension and severance expense  the incremental costs associated with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  and cost associated with exiting real estate facilities 
compared to results discussion total revenue was essentially flat in as compared to foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point benefit to revenue 
overall  increases in customer service revenue were essentially offset by a decline in product sales and professional services due to the constrained capital spending environment for information technology equipment 
by segment  revenue growth in retail store automation  financial self service  and customer services was offset by declines in the other segment  systemedia  and data warehousing 
revenue growth of in the emea region was offset by declines of in the americas region  in japan and in the asia pacific region 
the growth in the emea region was primarily due to positive foreign currency impact and higher volumes in financial self service and retail store automation 
the decline in the asia pacific region was mainly due to a volume decline as our significant growth in for financial self service and retail store automation was not sustained in changes in foreign currency rates provided a percentage point  a percentage point  and a percentage point benefit to the revenue in the emea region  japan  and the asia pacific region  respectively 
total operating income in was million compared to million in operating income for was impacted by million of pension expense compared to million of pension income for the million of pension expense for included million of incremental settlement charges for departures of employees in certain non us locations 
operating income for was positively impacted by our cost and expense reduction initiatives  the benefit of positive foreign currency fluctuations  and higher revenues in data warehousing support services 
also during the year  a million benefit was realized as we eliminated our us postretirement life insurance benefit in the third quarter of revenue and operating income loss by segment our key solutions are categorized as data warehousing  financial self service  retail store automation and customer services  each of which is a reportable operating segment 
in addition  our systemedia and payment and imaging solutions are reportable segments 
a seventh segment  other  primarily relates to the company s resale of third party computer hardware and related professional and installation services  and to a business in japan that is not aligned with our other segments 
our segments are comprised of hardware  software  and professional and installation related services 
for purposes of discussing our operating results by segment  we exclude the impact of certain items  such as pension expense  from operating income or loss  consistent with the manner by which management views each segment and reports our operating segment results under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends for each business 
it also includes the same information that is used by ncr management to make decisions regarding the segments and to assess our financial performance 
restructuring items in the fourth quarter of were also excluded from the discussion of operating results 
our segment results are reconciled to total company results reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america otherwise known as gaap in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in the segment discussions  we have disclosed the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue growth 
as a result of the weaker us dollar  the company benefited from currency fluctuations in  mainly in our emea  japan and asia pacific regions 
data warehousing provides the market leading teradata data warehousing database software  hardware platform and related services that enable companies to gain a competitive advantage by more quickly and efficiently analyzing a single integrated view of customer behavior and other business information and then delivering that business intelligence to the company s decision makers 
this segment s revenues are primarily generated in the enterprise data warehousing market  which is part of the larger database market 
the current business and financial model for data warehousing allows for a significant portion of revenue growth to enhance profitability 
our main strategic direction for the future is to increase our market share in the enterprise data warehouse market and to increase our penetration in the overall data warehousing market 
we plan to meet these goals by providing the technology  support and consulting services that companies need to capitalize on enterprise wide analytics and maximize the usefulness of their existing data 
we focus on adding companies that have massive amounts of data to leverage  which will generate a continued need for technology and consulting and lead to future upgrades and expansion 
the following table presents data warehousing including support services revenue and operating income for the years ended december data warehousing in millions revenue operating income operating income as a percent of revenue data warehousing revenue increased in from due to both an increase in product sales and support services 
foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point benefit to revenue 
the strong growth is indicative of customers valuing the superior analytical capabilities of our data warehousing solutions and the return on investment they can provide 
the increase in operating income from to reflects the increases in sales and support services 
consistent with our strategy  reductions in infrastructure costs allowed investment in sales and research and development initiatives 
data warehousing revenue declined in from due to the constrained capital expenditure environment  which was partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations and an increase in support services revenue 
foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point increase to revenue 
the capital spending environment remained depressed in as customers had limited budgets for large information technology expenditures  however  our existing customer base continued to purchase services to maintain their data warehouses 
operating income increased in as cost and expense reduction efforts provided benefits to our margin and operating expenses that offset the effects of lower volumes and typical price erosion 
we also experienced a positive shift in our mix during to higher margin software and hardware maintenance  which aided our operating income improvement 
while we have seen fluctuations in the information technology environment in the past  our outlook remains positive as we expect to see continued growth in versus a very strong our growth in support services and solution revenue should lead to higher operating income versus for this business 
financial self service provides atm related technologies including cash dispensers  services  and software solutions to financial institutions  retailers and independent deployers 
our financial self service solutions are designed to quickly and reliably process consumer transactions and incorporate advanced features such as web enablement  automated check cashing deposit  automated cash deposit  bill payment and the dispensing of non cash items 
the market demand for financial self service products and services is expected to grow moderately over the next few years due to an anticipated atm upgrade cycle in the americas and emea regions  expanding demand in emerging markets  and from banks moving to advanced function atms to increase their revenue and lower their operating costs 
our strategy is to fully distribute our sales force and invest in markets such as china  india and russia 
also  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of our market leading deposit automation technology and software which provide higher value solutions 
additionally  we are making progress to create a competitive cost advantage for this business  optimizing our human and asset capital deployment in order to become a lower cost supplier 
this includes streamlining our supply chain and producing atms in the region generating the demand 

table of contents a significant event in the financial services marketplace is the check clearing for the st century act  or check  which took effect in october the act is intended to improve the efficiency of the us federal reserve s current paper based clearing and settlement system through expedited funds availability and reduced risk associated with paper movement 
the financial self service business should realize benefits from this legislative change over the next several years 
financial institutions in the united states have begun to upgrade their atms in order to allow checks to be digitally scanned upon deposit at the atm so that they can eliminate the costly and slow process of clearing the paper form of the check 
the following table presents financial self service revenue and operating income for the years ended december financial self service atms in millions revenue operating income operating income as a percent of revenue revenue for financial self service grew in from the increase was the result of growth in all regions 
in the americas region  we continue to benefit from financial institutions in the united states upgrading their atm networks for recent regulatory changes 
growth in the emea region was reflective of banks upgrading their atms for the automation of cash deposits  as well as expansion of atm networks in eastern europe 
growth in the asia pacific region was broad based with meaningful growth in several countries 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations provided a benefit of percentage points to revenue 
operating income improved due to increased volume  the favorable movement of foreign currency  and expense reductions  which offset the effects of anticipated price erosion 
revenues in financial self service increased in as compared to primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations 
foreign currency provided a percentage point benefit in for this business 
services revenue included in this segment was higher in  but we experienced typical levels of product price erosion due to competitive pressures 
we experienced strong growth in the americas region as financial institutions increased spending for our advanced function atm solutions 
however  the asia pacific region s revenue declined relative to a difficult compare in operating income improved from due to cost and expense reduction programs and positive foreign currency fluctuations 
we have been successful in lowering our supply chain costs with the actions we took in  such as reducing the number of staging centers that customize atms and leveraging our regional manufacturing capabilities 
in  we expect revenue for financial self service to increase  at least in line with growth in the overall atm market 
to remain competitive in the market  it is imperative that we continue to reduce our costs by leveraging the synergies of our global manufacturing locations 
we expect operating income to increase at a rate greater than the growth in revenue as a result of our initiatives to reduce our cost and expense structure 
retail store automation provides retail oriented technologies such as pos terminals  bar code scanners and software  as well as innovative products such as our self checkout systems and self service kiosks  to companies worldwide 
combining our retail industry expertise  software and hardware technologies  and implementation and store performance consulting services  our retail store automation solutions are designed to enable cost reductions and improve operational efficiency for companies while increasing satisfaction of their customers 
ncr provides a highly competitive product offering for retailers in an increasingly commoditized market 
revenue in this segment will more than likely increase as retailers continue to upgrade and replace aging pos systems and install new self checkout and self service technologies 
in  the retail store automation business made significant improvements in lowering its cost structure  and will continue to focus on additional improvements in its operating model in we will continue to reduce our infrastructure costs as we shift investments into sales and research and development 
this includes making investments in new technologies that are projected to increase efficiencies for retailers  such as radio frequency identification rfid systems and self service technologies 
the following table presents retail store automation revenue and operating income loss for the years ended december retail store automation in millions revenue operating income loss operating income loss as a percent of revenue 
table of contents retail store automation revenue grew compared to the revenue growth was attributable to higher pos terminal and bar code scanner volumes  software  and professional services  as well as percentage points of benefit from foreign currency rate changes 
the operating income improvement of million was the result of higher volumes mentioned above  cost and expense reductions  and favorable foreign currency fluctuations 
revenue increased for retail store automation in compared to as increased demand and positive foreign currency fluctuations more than offset the price erosion we experienced during the year 
foreign currency provided a percentage point benefit for revenue 
the higher volumes were mainly driven by sales of self checkout systems  which were characterized by large  single purchases in the americas region 
the emea and japan regions also contributed to the growth  led by sales of pos terminals and self checkout systems in these regions 
the improvement in operating income was driven mainly by our cost reduction efforts  volume increases  and positive foreign currency impact 
these cost reductions included progress on our configure to order initiative and moving a portion of our product development activities to lower cost locations outside of the united states 
we expect higher revenue for retail store automation solutions due to increasing demand for self service technologies along with expansion of software and services 
due to higher revenue and our continuing actions to reduce cost and expense in this business  we expect operating income to improve in systemedia provides printer consumables and products including paper rolls for atms and pos workstations  inkjet and laser printer supplies  thermal transfer ribbons  labels  ink ribbons  laser documents  business forms and retail office products 
systemedia products are designed to reduce paper related failures in our atms and pos terminals and enable businesses to improve transaction accuracy while reducing overall costs 
the printer consumables market is highly fragmented  and market consolidation continues due to lower levels of demand in traditional media products such as paper rolls  fax paper  ink ribbons and forms 
excess capacity and lack of fixed cost coverage results in price competition that often uses only variable cost as its base 
the use of internet auctions and the willingness of customers to set lower paper grade specifications for the products they use also results in price and margin erosion 
to compete effectively in this market  we are shifting our market and application focus to consumable offerings that offer growth opportunities 
these include rfid products  laser documents  labels  ink jet supplies  laser cartridges and specialty media 
increased revenue in these products is expected to offset declines experienced in mature products due to the changes in printer technologies 
in addition to a shift to higher growth products  we are also working to increase our use of services and industry expertise 
increased focus on defining value drivers and refining our demand generation capabilities through additional direct sales resources is important to our strategy 
we will continue to review our cost structure and manufacturing efficiency in in order to drive improved profitability 
the following table presents systemedia revenue and operating income for the years ended december systemedia in millions revenue operating income operating income as a percent of revenue revenue for systemedia increased in from excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations  revenue was unchanged 
growth in the americas and asia pacific regions was offset by declines in the emea region and japan 
the decrease in operating income from was due to competition for traditional media products which affects both pricing and volumes 
cost and expense reductions were somewhat offset by significant increases in paper prices  which represents the largest percentage of product cost for this business 
revenue for the systemedia business declined from to due to softness in the market from a pricing and volume perspective as customers reduced their expenditures for printer consumables 
the americas region was impacted the most from the volume decline as customers we lost in late and early could not be replaced during the remainder of the year 
foreign currency provided a percentage point benefit to revenue 
operating income for systemedia increased in from due to cost reductions in both our material costs and manufacturing process  which more than outpaced the volume and price erosion impacts 

table of contents we expect similar revenue levels in versus  as gains in growth products are expected to be offset by competition in mature products 
we believe that operating income will increase slightly in due to our cost reduction efforts 
payment and imaging provides end to end solutions for both traditional paper based and image based check and item processing 
our imaging solutions utilize advanced image recognition and workflow technologies to automate item processing  helping financial institutions increase efficiency and reduce operating costs 
consisting of hardware  software  and consulting and support services  our comprehensive payment and imaging solutions enable check and item based transactions to be digitally scanned  processed and retained within a flexible  scalable environment 
the most significant event that has occurred in the check payment and imaging marketplace in recent years was the check clearing for the st century act  also known as check  which took effect in october of the act is intended to improve the efficiency of the us federal reserve s current paper based clearing and settlement system through expedited funds availability and reduced risk associated with paper movement 
ncr is well positioned for this change with our current image based solutions and services 
however  as the need for digital imaging increases  the reliance on products that were designed for paper based processing will decrease 
revenue growth in this segment will be challenging given these market dynamics 
the following table presents payment and imaging revenue and operating income for the years ended december payment and imaging in millions revenue operating income operating income as a percent of revenue revenue was down compared to foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point benefit to revenue 
increases in japan revenue were more than offset by small volume declines in the americas and asia pacific revenue 
operating income decreased in due to the volume decline and the continued shift in our revenue base from higher margin traditional processing equipment to lower margin imaging solutions as a result of the regulatory changes mentioned above 
revenue for payment and imaging lagged behind for the majority of the year due to a weakening demand for traditional paper based payment offerings  but a strong fourth quarter of from imaging solution implementations enabled revenues to be in line with foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point benefit to revenue 
despite flat revenue  operating income improved by million due to improved operational efficiencies and cost structure reductions 
as financial institutions continue to comply with check and invest in their check processing infrastructure  we expect a shift to digital imaging products from traditional paper processing products 
the impact of this shift is anticipated to result in lower payment and imaging revenue for and potentially lower operating income for this business 
although check will result in lower revenue in payment and imaging  it should continue to generate higher revenue in our larger atm business in future periods 
customer services are an essential component of our complete solution offerings 
ncr s customer services division provides maintenance and support services for ncr s products as well as some third party products 
maintenance and support services include site design  staging and implementation  and complete systems management 
we believe that customers value the integration of maintenance and support services with the hardware and software they purchase 
however  heavy competition in the services industry and anticipated revenue declines from businesses we exited in prior years has led to lower revenues and operating margins in our customer services business over the past few years 
the exited businesses relate to higher margin maintenance contracts associated with bank branch automation  account processing and low end server hardware we stopped selling a number of years ago 
we have taken steps to reverse the trend of declining profitability through cost management  such as the realignment of call centers we operate  and through operational efficiencies  such as implementing a new dispatching and productivity tool 
we have developed a long term services transformation process designed to deliver the operating margins we expect from this business 
building on the work started in  we will continue to pursue the following operational goals during change our strategic revenue focus to service of ncr products 
we will continue to support third party products when it aligns with our strategic and financial objectives 

table of contents increase the linkage between product engineering and the serviceability of our products eg  atms  pos systems 
further reduce infrastructure and service delivery costs 
build in diagnostics to improve the remote serviceability of our products 
ensure ncr intellectual property ip rights are not violated by third party service providers 
we have realized some benefit from each of these items to date 
however  as anticipated  this progress has not been sufficient to overcome the adverse impact of price erosion from heavy competition in the marketplace and the reduction of higher margin revenue associated with exited businesses 
we believe we can be more competitive in the marketplace by concentrating on servicing ncr products rather than on incremental services from third party products 
by proactively designing products for more efficient serviceability  time spent on service incidents will be reduced 
this will help us achieve a lower cost structure by shifting our service model to diagnose incidents remotely and dispatch personnel through a global operating model that takes advantage of personnel and incident location synergies 
also  we will continue to evaluate the number of customer call centers we maintain and modify their operations to enhance our remote diagnostic capabilities 
we believe these changes will lead to increased customer satisfaction through faster service  while reducing our service delivery costs 
unauthorized use of ncr intellectual property allows third party service providers a free ride on ncr s investment in research and development  giving them an unfair price advantage 
ncr s actions to enforce its ip rights and require that third parties properly license diagnostic software are intended to eliminate this free ride 
additionally  ncr continues to monitor and enforce its parts sales agreements to ensure that purchasers comply with program requirements and use parts for their intended purpose 
together  these activities help eliminate unfair cost advantages to third party service providers and generate an appropriate return on ncr s investment for development of its services intellectual property 
the following table presents customer services revenue and operating income for the years ended december customer services in millions revenue operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of revenue as anticipated  revenue for customer services decreased in compared to foreign currency fluctuations provided a percentage point benefit to revenue during the year 
customer services revenue was impacted by lower revenue from maintenance of third party products and continued price erosion as competition for services remains strong 
also affecting the year over year comparison is the declining base of high margin revenue associated with businesses we previously exited 
operating income declined due to price erosion and the effect of exited businesses  as well as from actions we are taking to correct the operating costs for this business 
one of these actions  planned headcount reductions  resulted in higher severance related postemployment benefits expense in however  these actions are expected to have a positive impact on operating income starting in revenues for customer services increased in versus  mainly driven by foreign currency fluctuations that provided a percentage point benefit 
we experienced declining revenue from higher margin maintenance contracts associated with businesses the company exited in prior years and continued price erosion due to competition 
operating income in declined from as cost and expense reductions were not able to offset declines in volume from exited businesses and price erosion factors 
customer services segment revenue in is expected to be slightly down compared to as planned declines in third party maintenance contracts and price erosion continue to limit our ability to generate growth 
we expect revenues from our exited businesses to continue to decline in  but not as materially as in prior years 
however  due to an improving mix of revenue and the cost actions mentioned above  operating income in is expected to improve compared to ncr s other operating segment primarily relates to the resale of third party computer hardware and related professional and installation services in our high availability and networking services businesses 
also included in this segment are the financial results from a business in japan that is not aligned with any of our other segments 

table of contents the following table presents other segment revenue and operating losses for the years ended december other segment in millions revenue operating loss operating loss as a percent of revenue revenue is expected to decline in this segment as we concentrate on reducing our third party product sales in order to focus on sales and services of ncr s products 
however  we also anticipate a lower loss in this segment as we reduce costs associated with this activity 
re engineering in the third quarter of  we announced re engineering plans to improve operational efficiency throughout ncr 
we are targeting process improvements to drive simplification  standardization  globalization and consistency across the organization 
during  despite the unfavorable movement of foreign exchange  our success in reducing costs and expenses put us firmly on track to deliver million of annualized cost savings by and an additional million through  using results as a starting point 
in addition to the activities described above in our businesses  we are making changes in our infrastructure to bring our costs in line with industry benchmarks 
regarding ncr s internal information technology  we continue to replace all major company applications  migrating from country centric applications to new enterprise applications such as our enterprise resource planning erp system  our global human resources system  and our teradata enterprise data warehouse 
our erp implementation is on schedule and we expect to have of all revenue generating countries around the world on erp by mid in our human resources organization  we have improved efficiencies and reduced costs by centralizing our staffing organization and controlling our external recruitment expenses 
in our finance and administration area  we are reorganizing and reducing our workforce to a lower cost structure 
in  ncr entered into a service agreement with accenture llp accenture  a global outsourcing services provider  under which many of ncr s key transaction processing activities  including overall and day to day responsibility for order and revenue processing  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and the company s general ledger function  will be performed by accenture 
the transition of responsibility for these activities  which is complete  began in the fourth quarter of  and will continue into as part of this transition  ncr s transaction processing activities will be streamlined and standardized for improved efficiency and consistency of practices globally 
as a result  we expect to significantly reduce our overall finance and administration costs and optimize the use of global and regional centers for transaction processing 
another element of the re engineering is our real estate consolidation and restructuring plan 
during  we reduced our number of properties by  representing a reduction in total properties from although the reduction in number of properties may be lower in future periods as compared to  we will continue to reduce excess square footage through better utilization of current space  increasing the use of virtual offices and the sale of underutilized facilities 
in connection with our restructuring plan  a pre tax restructuring charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of under eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  to provide for contractual lease termination costs 
the balance of this recorded liability at december  was million 
during  the company utilized million of the reserve 
the majority of the lease obligations will continue through  with one obligation continuing to effects of pension  postemployment  and postretirement benefit plans cost of revenue and total expenses for the years ended december were impacted by certain employee benefit plans as shown below in millions pension expense income postemployment expense postretirement expense net expense we recorded million of pension expense in versus million pension expense in the higher amount was due primarily to changes in the discount rate and the impact of the investment performance of our pension 
table of contents fund portfolio in the difficult market environments during through we expect pension expense of approximately million to million in also during  we made changes to our us defined benefit pension plans in order to limit participation only to employees who were at least years old and hired by august  as of september   the plans were closed to new participants 
postemployment expense severance and disability medical increased to million in  versus million in this increase in expense was mainly due to an expected higher level of involuntary turnover  primarily driven by the restructuring of customer services as well as lower discount rates in many countries in expense increased million in versus  due primarily to lower discount rates and higher disability claims 
postretirement plan expense medical in was million versus million in the decrease in expense was primarily due to the elimination of the us postretirement life insurance benefit  and increases in retiree cost sharing announced in in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of became law in the united states 
this new law will not have any material impact on ncr s postretirement plan liabilities or expense as the company does not provide prescription drug benefits to its medicare eligible retirees 
gross margin in  gross margin as a percentage of total revenue declined to from in both product and services gross margins were down versus the prior year 
most of the decline was due to million higher pension cost recorded in cost of sales in compared to additionally  pricing pressure had an adverse effect on gross margin rate 
in  gross margin as a percentage of total revenue declined to from in while our product gross margin showed a percentage point improvement  services margin decreased percentage points 
product gross margin increased due to higher margins in retail store automation from higher revenues and cost reductions  improved margins in data warehousing from a favorable mix shift to higher margin software  and volume increases and cost reduction measures in financial self service 
the decline in services margin is primarily due to the inclusion of million of pension expense in versus million of pension income in operating expenses our operating expenses  characterized as selling  general  and administrative expenses along with research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations  decreased to  million in versus  million in lower expenses were directly related to the continued actions to reduce our infrastructure and back office expenditures 
the reduction in these areas was partially offset by the increased investment in sales and demand creation in our data warehouse and financial self service segments  research and development  and million more of pension expense 
operating expenses for were  million compared to  million for the negative impact of pension expense and foreign currency fluctuations was greater than the expense reductions we achieved during for  operating expenses included million of pension expense compared to million of pension income in in  we plan to continue reducing our infrastructure costs  however  as was the case in  a portion of our cost savings will be reinvested to improve demand generation capabilities 
we are committed to new product development and will focus on achieving maximum yield from our research and development spending and resources 
interest and other expense and income items interest expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest expense in from was driven by lower interest rates from an interest rate swap and by the elimination of certain borrowings against company owned life insurance policies 
the increase in interest expense in from was due to the issuance in june of million of senior unsecured notes  which are due in the notes carry an interest rate of  however  the rate increased to in november because certain registration requirements under the securities act of were not met 
these registration requirements were met in may  and the interest rate was adjusted to its original fixed rate 
in november  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that converted million of the debt to a variable rate 
although this variable rate was lower than the fixed rate as of december   changes in the interest rate markets could raise the variable rate of the swap above the fixed rate of the debt  which would lead to higher expenses and cash outflows 
other income and expense  net  was million of income  million of expense  and million of expense in   and  respectively 
included million of real estate gains  million related to receipt of an acquisition break up fee  million for recovery of a non trade receivable that was previously fully reserved  and a million release of a reserve for exit of certain countries in the middle east and africa region 
the reserve was previously made to account for an expected loss on sale when the company anticipated exiting certain countries 
however  due to a realignment in strategy in late  the company now believes it can profitably market an attractive range of products to these countries by utilizing a shared resource infrastructure 

table of contents in  due to the reassessment of the accrual for the potential future liability related to the fox river environmental matter  we recorded million in other expense 
the risks and uncertainties associated with this matter are discussed in the environmental and legal contingencies section of the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this md a and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the other expense consisted primarily of a million investment basis write down of marketable securities in japan for losses that were considered to be other than temporary  a million charge relating to an indemnification claim made by lucent technologies  inc lucent  million of real estate consolidation impairment charges and million of costs relating to the disposition of a small non strategic business 
we reversed million of the lucent indemnification charge in the first quarter of  which resulted in recognition of other income due to updated information received from lucent as to the actual extent of the claim 
income tax income tax benefit was million in compared to income tax expense of million in and income tax expense of million in the income tax benefit in included an million benefit resulting from a favorable settlement of audit items relating to the period when ncr was a subsidiary of at t 
the income tax expense in included million for an increase to the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets of ncr s japanese subsidiaries 
the income tax expense in was reduced by a million benefit relating to the resolution of outstanding issues on refund claims from the us and french governments 
our effective tax benefit rate was approximately for  including the million tax benefit 
excluding the million  our effective tax rate was 
the effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by profit generated in several foreign countries which have lower effective tax rates due to prior year losses 
our effective tax rate was approximately for  and included the impact of the reserve taken for the fox river environmental matter and income related to the lucent indemnification claim 
these items provided a percentage point benefit to the effective tax rate for each year  our effective tax rate includes a certain amount of benefit related to the use of foreign tax credits 
for and  the amount of such benefits as compared to the amount of income before tax was larger than prior years 
our effective tax rate was approximately for including the tax impacts relating to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and the benefit from the resolution of outstanding issues on refund claims 
these items provided a percentage point benefit to the effective tax rate for we anticipate our effective tax rate will be approximately in however  changes in profit mix or one time events  such as audit settlements  could change this rate 
cumulative effect of accounting change the cumulative effect of accounting change in was a non cash  net of tax goodwill impairment charge of million which relates to the adoption of sfas financial condition  liquidity and capital resources to assess the financial performance of the company  ncr s management uses a non gaap measure called free cash flow  which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  reworkable service parts  and additions to capitalized software 
the components that are used to calculate free cash flow are gaap measures disclosed on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations 
in particular  free cash flow indicates the amount of cash available after capital expenditures for  among other things  investments in the company s existing businesses  strategic acquisitions  repurchase of ncr stock and repayment of debt obligations 
this non gaap measure should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  cash flows from operating activities 
the table below shows the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures for the following years in millions net cash provided by operating activities less net expenditures and proceeds for service parts expenditures for property  plant and equipment additions to capitalized software free cash flow 
table of contents the amount of net cash provided by operating activities in was similar to the amount generated in however  in  the amount was driven almost entirely by income adjusted for non cash items 
in contrast  cash provided by operating activities in was made up of a much lower amount of income adjusted for non cash items  but was supplemented by a net reduction in working capital which positively impacted cash flow 
the increase in our net income in as compared to was driven by an increase in revenue and by our cost and expense reduction initiatives 
the net changes in asset and liability balances in had a minimal impact on operating cash flow as increases in assets were generally offset by increases in liabilities 
increases in current payables as well as increases in customer deposits and deferred service revenue favorably impacted cash flow by million and million  respectively 
the increase in current payables was largely due to continued improvements in payment terms as well as higher volume of payables driven by higher revenue volumes in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year 
the customer deposits and deferred service revenue balance increased due to improved terms for the collection of maintenance services billings 
offsetting the positive cash flow impact from increases in these liabilities were increases in accounts receivables and inventory balances  which had a negative impact on cash flow of million and million  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable was driven by higher fourth quarter sales  which were million more than in the same period of the prior year 
the impact of this increase in fourth quarter sales was somewhat mitigated by improved collection times as compared to the prior year period 
inventory balances continued to increase in mostly due to retail store automation s continued conversion to a configure to order model  which drives shorter lead times but increases inventory on hand 
in  our capital expenditures increased to million from million in we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million  which is about equal to our expected depreciation and amortization expense 
we expect net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  otherwise defined as free cash flow  to be more than million in financing activities and certain other investing activities are not included in our calculation of free cash flow 
these other investing activities included net proceeds of million from the purchases and sales of short term investments  proceeds from the sale of real estate of million  and cash outflows of million for activities largely consisting of our purchase of kinetics  inc for million 
our financing activities in mainly consisted of cash outflows from our share repurchase activities and cash inflows from the issuance of shares through our employee stock plans 
during  we purchased million shares of ncr common stock for million as compared to million shares purchased for million in shares for and reflect the impact of a two for one stock split effective january  cash inflows from stock plans were million in compared to million in the increase in cash inflows was driven by an increase in the number of options exercised by employees 
the overall impact of our share purchases and issuances in was a reduction of million shares outstanding as compared to the share purchases are part of a systematic purchase program authorized by ncr s board of directors 
we will continue this program in  however  the amount of stock purchases may vary from past years 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that impact  or could impact  the liquidity of our operations 
the following table and discussion outlines our material obligations at december   with projected cash payments in the years shown in millions total amounts and thereafter debt obligations lease obligations purchase obligations total debt  lease  and purchase obligations as of december   we have long term debt totaling million  of which a significant portion is from our senior unsecured notes due in as previously discussed  million of the notes were converted to a variable rate in november through an interest rate swap agreement 
interest payments for the debt are payable semi annually in arrears on each june and december  and contain certain covenants typical of this type of debt instrument 

table of contents our lease obligations are primarily for certain sales and manufacturing facilities in various domestic and international locations 
purchase obligations represent committed purchase orders and other contractual commitments for goods or services 
the purchase obligation amounts were determined through information in our procurement systems and payment schedules for significant contracts 
included in the amounts are committed payments in relation to the long term service agreement with accenture 
we have short and long term liabilities in relation to the fox river environmental matter that may require future cash payments 
we also have product warranties and several guarantees to third parties that may affect future cash flow 
these commitments and contingencies are described in detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our us and international employee benefit plans  which are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  could require significant future cash payments 
the unfunded status of ncr s us retirement plans increased to million in from million in the increase is attributable to an increase in benefit obligations resulting from the reduction in the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future pension liabilities which was partially offset by an above market return on pension assets 
the unfunded status of our international retirement plans also increased from million to million 
asset returns and company contributions both contributed positively  but were offset by increases in our benefit obligations due to reductions in our discount rate assumptions  additional benefit accruals and foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company did not make any contributions to its us qualified pension plan in  and we will not be required to make any contributions in contributions to international and executive pension plans are expected to increase from million in to approximately million in in october  the company replaced a million day unsecured credit facility with a million five year unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions 
in addition to the million facility  the company has a million  five year unsecured revolving credit facility which the company entered into in october the credit facilities contain certain representations and warranties  conditions  affirmative  negative and financial covenants  and events of default customary for such facilities 
interest rates charged on borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities are based on prevailing market rates 
no amounts were outstanding under the facilities at december  and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million as of december  we believe our cash flows from operations  the credit facilities existing or future arrangements  the senior notes  and other short and long term debt financing  will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital  research and development activities  capital expenditures  pension contributions and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other business and risk factors described below in factors that may affect future results 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or otherwise comply with the terms of our credit facilities and the senior notes  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or seek additional financing alternatives 
factors that may affect future results this report and other documents that we file with the us securities and exchange commission sec  as well as other oral or written statements we may make from time to time  contain information based on management s beliefs and include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that involve a number of known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance  and there are a number of factors including  but not limited to  those listed below  which could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
economic pressures our business is affected by the global economies in which we operate 
the current economic climate  which includes decreased and or more closely scrutinized capital spending by many industries  could impact our ability to meet our commitments to customers  the ability of our suppliers to meet their commitments to us  the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers  or the ability of our customers to fulfill their obligations to us on a timely basis 
the extent of this impact  if any  is dependent on a number of factors  including the duration of the current economic climate  its effect on the markets and other general economic and business conditions 
competition our ability to compete effectively within the technology industry is critical to our future success 
we operate in the intensely competitive information technology industry 
this industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  price and cost reductions  and increasingly greater commoditization of products  making differentiation difficult 
our competitors include other large companies in the technology industry such as ibm  oracle corporation  diebold  inc  wincor  getronics nv  and 
table of contents unisys corporation  some of which have widespread distribution and penetration of their platforms and service offerings 
in addition  we compete with companies in specific markets such as self checkout  entry level atms  payment and imaging  and business consumables and media products 
our future competitive performance and market position depend on a number of factors  including our ability to react to competitive product and pricing pressures  penetrate and meet the changing competitive requirements and deliverables in developing and emerging markets  such as india and china in the atm business  rapidly and continually design  develop and market  or otherwise maintain and introduce solutions and related products and services for our customers that are competitive in the marketplace  react on a timely basis to shifts in market demands  compete in reverse auctions for new and continuing business  take advantage of data warehousing market demands  reduce costs without creating operating inefficiencies  maintain competitive operating margins  improve product and service delivery quality  and effectively market and sell all of our diverse solutions 
our business and operating performance could be impacted by external competitive pressures  such as increasing price erosion and the addition of new competitors 
our customers sometimes finance our product sales through third party financing companies 
in case of customer default  these financing companies may be forced to resell this equipment at discounted prices impacting our ability to sell incremental units 
the impact of these product and pricing pressures could include lower customer satisfaction  decreased demand for our solutions  loss of market share and reduction of operating profits 
operating result fluctuations our revenue and operating results could fluctuate for a number of reasons including seasonality our sales are historically seasonal  with lower revenue in the first quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year 
such seasonality also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume  timing and mix of product sales 
in addition  revenue in the third month of each quarter is typically higher than in the first and second months 
these factors  among other things  make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately 
foreign currency our revenue and operating income are subject to variability due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations against the us dollar 
we have exposure to approximately functional currencies  in which our primary exposure is from fluctuations in the euro  british pound and japanese yen 
due to our global operations  weaknesses in some of these currencies are sometimes offset by strengths in others 
although the foreign currency environment is difficult to predict  the effects of currency fluctuations are partially mitigated by our hedging strategy 
cost expense reductions we are actively working to reduce our costs and expenses to improve operating profitability without jeopardizing the quality of our products or the efficiencies of our operations 
our success in achieving targeted cost and expense reductions depends on a number of factors  including our ability to achieve infrastructure rationalizations  drive lower component costs  improve supply chain efficiencies  and reduce inventory levels  among other things 
if we do not successfully complete our cost reduction initiatives  our results of operation or financial condition could be adversely affected 
contractual obligations of consulting services we maintain a professional services consulting workforce to fulfill contracts that we enter into with our customers that may extend to multiple periods 
our profitability is largely a function of performing to customer contractual arrangements within the estimated costs to perform these obligations 
if we exceed these estimated costs  our profitability related to these contracts may be negatively impacted 
in addition  if we are not able to maintain appropriate utilization rates for our consultants  we may not be able to sustain profitability on these contracts 
acquisitions and divestitures as part of our solutions strategy  we intend to selectively acquire and divest technologies  products and businesses 
as these acquisitions and divestures take place and we begin to include  or exclude as the case may be  the financial results related to these transactions  it could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
pension funds consistent with local competitive practice and regulations  we sponsor pension plans in many of the countries where we do business 
a number of these pension plans are supported by pension fund investments which are subject to financial market risk 
the liabilities and assets of these plans are reported in our financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  employer s accounting for pensions 
in conforming to the requirements of sfas  we are required to make a number of actuarial assumptions for each plan  including expected long term return on plan assets and discount rate 
our future financial results could be materially impacted by volatility in financial market performance and changes in the actuarial assumptions  including those described in our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed below 
consistent with the requirements of paragraphs of sfas  we estimate our discount rate and long term expected rate of return on assets assumptions on a country by country basis after consultation with independent actuarial consultants 
we 
table of contents examine interest rate trends within each country  particularly yields on high quality long term corporate bonds  to determine our discount rate assumptions 
our long term expected rate of return on asset assumptions are developed by considering the asset allocation and implementation strategies employed by each pension fund relative to capital market expectations 
stock option accounting similar to other companies  we use stock options as a form of compensation for certain employees 
currently  the expense of these stock options is not reflected in the operating results under accounting guidance from accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the amount recognized for stock compensation could vary depending on a number of assumptions or changes 
for example  assumptions such as risk free rate and expected volatility that drive our valuation model could change 
other examples that could have an impact include changes in our compensation plans  tax rate  or an unusually high amount of expirations of stock options 
further disclosure is reported in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  stock compensation  and recently issued accounting pronouncements 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate 
real estate our strategy over the past several years with respect to real estate has been to reduce our holdings of excess real estate 
in line with this strategy  we anticipate the exit of facilities  which may affect net income 
adverse real estate markets could impede our ability to reduce the size of our real estate portfolio 
multinational operations generating substantial revenues from our multinational operations helps to balance our risks and meet our strategic goals 
in  the percentage of revenues from outside of the united states was 
we believe that our geographic diversity may help to mitigate some risks associated with geographic concentrations of operations eg  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and deteriorating economic environments or business disruptions due to economic or political uncertainties 
however  our ability to sell our solutions domestically in the united states and internationally is subject to the following risks  among others general economic and political conditions in each country which could adversely affect demand for our solutions in these markets  currency exchange rate fluctuations which could result in lower demand for our products as well as generate currency translation losses  changes to and compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations which may increase our cost of doing business in these markets or otherwise prevent us from effectively competing in these markets  changing competitive requirements and deliverables in developing and emerging markets  and the impact of civil unrest relating to war and terrorist activity on the economy or markets in general  or on our ability  or that of our suppliers  to meet commitments 
introduction of new solutions the solutions we sell are very complex  and we need to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new solutions in a competitive  rapidly changing environment 
the development process for our solutions  including our software application development programs and the migration of our teradata data warehousing solution to the latest hardware and software platforms  requires high levels of innovation from both our developers and our suppliers of the components embedded in our solutions 
in addition  the development process can be lengthy and costly  and requires us to commit a significant amount of resources to bring our business solutions to market 
if we are unable to anticipate our customers needs and technological trends accurately  or are otherwise unable to complete development efficiently  we would be unable to introduce new solutions into the market on a timely basis  if at all  and our business and operating results could be impacted 
likewise  we sometimes make assurances to customers regarding new technologies  and our results could be impacted if we are unable to deliver such technologies as planned 
also  if we cannot successfully market and sell both existing and newly developed solutions  our business and operating results could be impacted 
our hardware and software based solutions may contain known  as well as undetected errors  which may be found after the products introduction and shipment 
while we attempt to remedy errors that we believe would be considered critical by our customers prior to shipment  we may not be able to detect or remedy all such errors  and this could result in lost revenues  delays in customer acceptance  and incremental costs  which would all impact our business and operating results 

table of contents reliance on third parties third party suppliers provide important elements to our solutions 
in most cases  there are a number of vendors producing the parts and components that we utilize 
however  there are some components that are purchased from single sources due to price  quality  technology or other reasons 
for example  we depend on silicon computer chips and microprocessors from intel corporation and operating systems from microsoft corporation 
certain parts and components used in the manufacture of our atms and the delivery of many of our retail store automation solutions are also supplied by single sources 
in addition  there are a number of key suppliers for our businesses who provide us with critical products for our solutions 
if we were unable to purchase the necessary parts  components or products from a particular vendor and we had to find an alternative supplier  our new and existing product shipments and solutions deliveries could be delayed  impacting our business and operating results 
we have  from time to time  formed alliances with third parties that have complementary products  software  services and skills 
many different relationships are formed by these alliances  such as outsourcing arrangements to manufacture hardware and subcontract agreements with third parties to perform services and provide products and software to our customers in connection with our solutions 
for example  we rely on third parties for cash replenishment services for our atm products 
also  some of these third parties have access to confidential ncr and customer data  the integrity and security of which we need to ensure 
these alliances introduce risks that we cannot control  such as nonperformance by third parties and difficulties with or delays in integrating elements provided by third parties into our solutions 
lack of information technology infrastructure  shortages in business capitalization  manual processes and data integrity issues of smaller suppliers can also create product time delays  inventory and invoicing problems and staging delays  as well as other operating issues 
the failure of third parties to provide high quality products or services that conform to required specifications or contractual arrangements could impair the delivery of our solutions on a timely basis  create exposure for non compliance with our contractual commitments to our customers and impact our business and operating results 
intellectual property as a technology company  our intellectual property portfolio is key to our future ability to be a leading technology and services solutions provider 
to that end  it is critical that we continue to develop leading technologies to protect and enhance our proprietary rights in our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
these efforts include protection of the products and application  diagnostic and other software we develop 
to the extent we are not successful  our business could be adversely impacted 
also  many of our offerings rely on technologies developed by others  and if we are not able to continue to obtain licenses for such technologies  our business would be impacted 
there has been a recent increase in the issuance of software and business method patents  and more companies are aggressively enforcing their intellectual property rights 
this trend could impact ncr because from time to time we receive notices from third parties regarding patent and other intellectual property claims 
whether such claims are with or without merit  they may require significant resources to defend 
if an infringement claim is successful  in the event we are unable to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non infringing technology  our business could be adversely affected 
work environment restructuring and re engineering as we discussed above  we are implementing a re engineering plan to drive operational efficiency throughout our company 
in order to drive cost and expense out of our businesses  we are rationalizing our infrastructure through real estate and support cost reductions including consolidating a portion of our product development functions to locations outside of the united states  simplifying our front and back office processes by  for example  standardizing global it applications and finance and administration processes  reducing our product costs through design and procurement initiatives  and working to lower our cost of services through completion of a global model for such services 
in addition  as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure  from time to time  we shift and realign our employee resources  which could temporarily result in substandard productivity levels 
also  as we move our transaction support processes to accenture  we have mutually agreed to schedules for the transition of work 
an inability to meet the associated timelines or commitments on the part of either ncr or accenture could have a material adverse impact on the company s results from operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition to reducing costs and expenses  our plan includes initiatives to grow revenue  such as improving sales training  addressing sales territory requirements  maintaining and monitoring customer satisfaction with our solutions  and focusing on our strong value propositions 
we currently have many initiatives underway 
if we are not successful in managing these initiatives and minimizing any resulting loss in productivity  our business and operating results could be impacted 
employees our employees are vital to our success 
our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  sales  consulting and other key personnel is critical  as these key employees are difficult to replace 
our current re engineering efforts may adversely impact our workforce 
if we are not able to attract or retain highly qualified employees by offering competitive compensation  secure work environments and leadership opportunities now and in the future  our business and operating results could be impacted 

table of contents internal controls accounting policies and practices our internal controls  accounting policies and practices  and internal information systems enable us to capture and process transactions in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  laws and regulations  taxation requirements and federal securities laws and regulations 
our internal controls and policies are being closely monitored by management as we implement a worldwide erp system and transition our transaction support functions to accenture 
while we believe these controls  policies  practices and systems are adequate to ensure data integrity  unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees both domestic and international  temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in transition planning and oversight  or resource constraints could lead to improprieties and undetected errors that could impact our financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  while management has concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  as set forth in management s report on internal control over financial reporting included later in this annual report  due to its inherent limitations  such controls may not prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial statements 
such limitations include  among other things  the potential for human error or circumvention of controls 
further  the company s internal control over financial reporting is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of a failure to remediate control deficiencies  changes in conditions  or a deterioration of the degree of compliance with established policies and procedures 
information systems it is periodically necessary to replace  upgrade or modify our internal information systems 
if we are unable to replace  upgrade or modify such systems in a timely and cost effective manner  especially in light of demands on our information technology resources  our ability to capture and process financial transactions and therefore our financial condition or results of operation may be impacted 
acquisitions and alliances our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or effectively manage alliance activities will help drive future growth 
as part of our overall solutions strategy  we intend to make investments in companies  products  services and technologies  either through acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic alliances 
acquisitions and alliance activities inherently involve risks 
the risks we may encounter include those associated with assimilating and integrating different business operations  corporate cultures  personnel  infrastructures and technologies or products acquired or licensed  and the potential for unknown liabilities within the acquired or combined business 
the investment or alliance may also disrupt our ongoing business  or we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired products  services or technologies into our solutions and maintain quality 
further  we may not achieve the projected synergies once we have integrated the business into our operations 
this may lead to additional costs not anticipated at the time of acquisition 
it is our policy not to discuss or comment upon negotiations regarding such business combinations or divestitures unless they are material and a definitive agreement is signed or circumstances indicate a high degree of probability that a material transaction will be consummated  unless the law requires otherwise 
environmental our historical and ongoing manufacturing activities subject us to environmental exposures 
our facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws  and we have investigatory and remedial activities underway at a number of facilities that we currently own or operate  or formerly owned or operated  to comply  or to determine compliance  with such laws 
given the uncertainties inherent in such activities  there can be no assurances that the costs required to comply with applicable environmental laws will not impact future operating results 
we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with certain environmental matters  including the fox river matter  as further described in environmental matters under note of notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  and in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this md a  and we incorporate such disclosures by reference and make them a part of this risk factor 
as described in more detail in such disclosures  we maintain an accrual for our potential liability relating to the fox river matter which represents certain critical estimates and judgments made by us regarding our potential liability  however  both the ultimate costs associated with the fox river matter and our share of those costs are subject to a wide range of potential outcomes 
contingencies like other technology companies  we face uncertainties with regard to regulations  lawsuits and other related matters 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  claims and other matters  including those that relate to the environment  health and safety  employee benefits  export compliance  intellectual property and other regulatory compliance and general matters 
because such matters are subject to many uncertainties  their outcomes are not predictable 
while we believe that amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are currently adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities  there can be no assurances that the amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from such matters will not impact future operating results 
additionally  we are 
table of contents subject to diverse and complex laws and regulations  including those relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and reporting  which are rapidly changing and subject to many possible changes in the future 
although we do not believe that recent regulatory and legal initiatives will result in significant changes to our internal practices or our operations  rapid changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements  and federal securities laws and regulations  among others  may substantially increase costs to our organization and could have an impact on our future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
our critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain 
different estimates could have a material impact on our financial results 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances 
our management continually reviews these estimates and assumptions to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and are materially correct 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the significant accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are discussed in the paragraphs below 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditors and the audit committee of our board of directors see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition consistent with other companies that provide similar solution offerings that include hardware  software  professional consulting and support services  revenue recognition is often complex and subject to multiple accounting pronouncements 
these include statement of position  software revenue recognition  staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force no 
issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
we consider revenue realized  or realizable  and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policies 
revenue recognition for complex contractual arrangements requires a greater degree of judgment  including a review of specific contracts  past experience  creditworthiness of customers  international laws and other factors 
changes in judgments about these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized between periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
we establish provisions for doubtful accounts using percentages of our accounts receivable balances as an overall proxy to reflect historical average credit losses and provision for known issues 
these percentages are applied to aged accounts receivable balances 
aged accounts are determined based on the number of days the receivable is outstanding  measured from the date of the invoice  or from the date on which payment is due 
as the age of the receivable increases  the provision percentage also increases 
this policy is applied to all of our operating segments 
based on the factors below  we periodically review customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential losses 
factors include economic conditions and judgments regarding collectibility of account balances  each customer s payment history and creditworthiness 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december was million in  million in  and million in these allowances represent  and of gross receivables for  and  respectively 
although no near term changes are expected  unforeseen changes to future allowance percentages could materially impact overall financial results 
given our experience  we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if one or more of our larger customers were to default on its obligations  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
if economic conditions deteriorate  we may increase our reserves for doubtful accounts 

table of contents inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
each quarter  our business segments reassess raw materials  work in process  parts and finished equipment inventory average costs for purchase or usage variances from standards  and valuation adjustments are made 
additionally  to properly provide for potential exposure due to slow moving  excess  obsolete or unusable inventory  a reserve against inventory is established 
this reserve is established based on forecasted usage  orders  technological obsolescence and inventory aging 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction  and require estimates and management judgment that may include elements that are uncertain 
on a quarterly basis  we review the current market value of inventory and require each business segment to ensure that inventory balances are adjusted for any inventory exposure due to age or excess of cost over market value 
we have inventory in more than countries around the world 
we transfer inventory from our plants to our distribution and sales organizations 
this inventory is transferred at cost plus mark up 
this mark up is referred to as inter company profit 
each quarter we review our inventory levels and analyze our inter company profit for each of our segments to determine the amount of inter company profit to eliminate 
key assumptions are made to estimate product gross margins  the product mix of existing inventory balances and current period shipments 
over time  we refine these estimates as facts and circumstances change 
if our estimates require refinement  our results could be impacted 
our excess and obsolete reserves for inventory were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively  and represent  and of our gross inventory balances for each period 
although we strive to achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory obsolescence or excess quantities caused by these factors  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional reserves may be needed 
any changes in reserves will impact operating income during a given period 
this policy is consistently applied to all of our operating segments and we do not anticipate any changes to our policy in the near term 
warranty reserves one of our key objectives is to provide superior quality products and services 
to that end  we provide a standard manufacturer s warranty extending up to months such that  should products under warranty require repair  no additional cost of that repair will be charged to our customers 
a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs is also recorded at the time of the sale 
we sometimes offer extended warranties to our customers for purchase 
we defer the fair value of these revenues and recognize revenue over the life of the warranty 
this impacts all segments of our business except for the other segment where minimal warranty  if any  is offered 
future warranty obligation costs are based upon historic factors such as labor rates  average repair time  travel time  number of service calls per machine and cost of replacement parts 
each segment consummating a sale recognizes the total customer revenue and records the associated warranty liability based upon the pre established warranty percentages for that product class 
total warranty costs were million  million and million  representing  and of total product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
historically  the principal factor used to estimate our warranty costs has been service calls per machine 
significant changes in this factor could result in actual warranty costs differing from accrued estimates 
although no near term changes in our estimated warranty reserves are currently anticipated  in the unlikely event of a significant increase in warranty claims by one or more of our larger customers  costs to fulfill warranty obligations would be higher than provisioned  thereby impacting results 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefits we account for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
our postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and our postemployment plans are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
we have significant pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit costs and credits  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability relating to these plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  rate of increase in health care costs  total and involuntary turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop our valuations 
we generally review and update these assumptions on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension  postretirement or postemployment benefits expense we have recorded or may record 
postretirement and postemployment expenses impact all of our segments  while pension expense is reported at the corporate level 

table of contents the key assumptions used in developing our pension and postretirement plan expense were the discount rate of and expected return on assets assumption of for our us plans  which represent and of pension and postretirement plan obligations  respectively 
holding all other assumptions constant  a change in the discount rate used for the us plans would have increased or decreased pre tax income by approximately million million in pension expense and million in postretirement expense 
likewise  a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the us pension plan would have increased or decreased pre tax income by approximately million 
our expected return on plan assets has historically been and will likely continue to be material to net income 
while it is required that we review our actuarial assumptions each year at the measurement date  we generally do not change them between measurement dates 
we use a measurement date of december for all of our plans 
in determining pension and postretirement expense for the us plans  we intend to use a discount rate of and  respectively  and an expected rate of return on assets assumption of 
the most significant assumption used in developing our postemployment plan expense was the assumed rate of involuntary turnover of 
the involuntary turnover rate is based on historical trends and projections of involuntary turnover in the future 
a change in the rate of involuntary turnover would have increased or decreased pre tax expense by approximately million 
the sensitivity of the assumptions described above is specific to each individual plan and not to our pension  postretirement and postemployment plans in the aggregate 
environmental and legal contingencies each quarter  we review the status of each claim and legal proceeding and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies 
to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue for the low end of the range 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments  and external factors beyond our control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
except for the sharing agreement with appleton papers inc api described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  note with respect to the fox river matter  when insurance carriers or third parties have agreed to pay any amounts related to costs  and we believe that it is probable that we can collect such amounts  those amounts would be reflected as receivables in our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant legal contingency impacting our company relates to the fox river matter  which is further described in detail in note this matter impacts our company overall and does not affect the financial results of any one of its segments 
as described in note  ncr was identified as a potentially responsible party prp at the fox river site in wisconsin because of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb discharges from two carbonless paper manufacturing facilities previously owned by ncr located along the fox river 
our reserve for the fox river matter was approximately million as of december  after taking into consideration amounts expected to be recovered under an indemnity agreement discussed in note 
the company regularly re evaluates the assumptions used in determining the appropriate reserve for the fox river matter as additional information becomes available and  when warranted  makes appropriate adjustments 
as described below and in note  the extent of our potential liability in connection with the fox river matter is subject to many uncertainties at this time  including the amount of dredging that will be required by the us environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources the governments  how contaminated sediments will be managed  the accuracy of existing cost estimates actual costs could be substantially higher than estimated in the governments clean up plans or records of decision rods that were issued in  and the extent of ncr s eventual liability 
in setting our reserve  we attempt to estimate a range of reasonably possible outcomes for relevant factors  although each range is itself highly uncertain 
we use our best estimate within the range if that is possible 
where there is a range of equally probable outcomes  and there is no amount within that range that appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  we use the low end of the range 
our eventual liability  which we expect will be paid out over a period of at least ten years  and likely as long as twenty to forty or more years  will depend on a number of factors  the most significant of which include the total clean up costs for the site we use the low end of the range million which is derived from the governments estimates in the rods  increased by to account for what we determined were underestimates in the governments figures  the total natural resource damages for the site we use the low end of the range million which is derived from government estimates in a report  
table of contents the share ncr and api will jointly bear of the total clean up costs and natural resource damages we use the low end of the range  which is based primarily on an estimate of the joint ncr api percentage of direct discharges of pcbs to the fox river  the share ncr will bear of the joint ncr api payments for clean up costs and natural resource damages we estimate we would pay approximately half of the total costs jointly attributable to ncr api  and our transaction costs to defend ncr in this matter we have estimated the costs we are likely to incur over the next ten years  the time period the governments project it will take to design and implement the remedy for the fox river 
at t and lucent technologies  inc lucent are jointly responsible for indemnifying ncr for a portion of amounts for the fox river incurred by ncr over a certain threshold 
ncr s estimate of what at t and lucent will pay under the indemnity is recorded as a long term receivable of million and is deducted in determining the net amount discussed above 
while it remains difficult to predict  we do not expect there to be any significant near term changes to any of the above described assumptions that are likely to have a material effect on the amount of our accrual 
however  there are other estimates for each of these factors which are significantly higher than the estimates described above 
we believe there is such uncertainty surrounding these estimates that we cannot quantify the high end of the range of such estimates 
in any event  assuming  for example  that the assumptions described above are each doubled except where that would be inconsistent with an existing agreement  and taking into account our payments under the interim settlement with the governments discussed in note  our payments for the potential liabilities for the fox river matter would be approximately million to be paid out over at least the ten year period ending in  and likely as long as twenty to forty or more years 
at t and lucent are jointly responsible for indemnifying us for a portion of amounts incurred by our company over a certain threshold  and the million estimate assumes they will make such payments 
if we were in fact required to pay an amount such as million for ncr s share of the fox river liabilities  it would have a moderate but manageable impact on our liquidity and capital resources  assuming that such amount was required to be paid over the time frame currently contemplated 
however  if such an amount were required to be paid in a shorter time period  it could have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on our expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and our tax methods of accounting 
we also review our liabilities under sfas no 
 which requires an accrual for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these projections and estimates may change in the future as actual results become known 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate 
the impact to our effective tax rate would be an increase of one percentage point for each increase of million to the valuation allowance as of december  we had a valuation allowance of million as of december   related to certain deferred income tax assets  primarily tax loss carryforwards  in jurisdictions where there is uncertainty as to ultimate realization of a benefit from those tax assets 
as of december   the valuation allowance was million 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when required  impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
we determine the fair value of these assets based upon estimates of future cash flows  market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if required 
in analyzing the fair value and recoverability using future cash flows  we make projections based on a number of assumptions and estimates of growth rates  future economic conditions  
table of contents assignment of discount rates and estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
the measurement of impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
this policy is applied to all of our operating segments 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and sfas in june sfas specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas also requires intangible assets with definite useful lives to continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives and be tested for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
indefinite life intangible assets must be tested annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life 
if the intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life  the asset shall be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas similar to goodwill  the assessment of impairment for intangible assets requires estimates of future cash flows 
to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  long lived assets  for our disclosure regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
recently issued accounting pronouncements a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and we incorporate such discussion in this md a by reference and make it a part hereof 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we use a variety of measures to monitor and manage these risks  including derivative financial instruments 
since a substantial portion of our operations and revenue occur outside the united states  and in currencies other than the us dollar  our results can be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage our exposures and mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the operations of our foreign subsidiaries  we hedge our main transactional exposures through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
this is primarily done through the hedging of foreign currency denominated inter company inventory purchases by the marketing units and of foreign currency denominated inventory sales by the manufacturing units 
all of these transactions are firmly committed or forecasted 
these foreign exchange contracts are designated as highly effective cash flow hedges 
the gains or losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized in the determination of income when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings 
as we hedge inventory purchases  the ultimate gain or loss from the derivative contract is recorded in cost of revenue when the inventory is sold to an unrelated third party 
we have exposure to approximately functional currencies  in which our primary exposure is from fluctuations in the euro  british pound  and japanese yen 
due to our global operations  weaknesses in some of these currencies are sometimes offset by strengths in others 
the us dollar was weaker in as compared to based on comparable weighted averages for our functional currencies 
this had a favorable impact of on revenue versus revenue 
this does not include the effects of our hedging activities and  therefore  does not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating income 
our strategy is to hedge  on behalf of each subsidiary  a portion of our non functional currency denominated cash flows for a period of up to months 
in this way  some of the impact of currency fluctuations on non functional currency denominated transactions and hence on subsidiary operating income  as stated in the functional currency is mitigated in the near term 
the amount we hedge and the length of time hedge contracts are entered into may vary significantly 
in the longer term longer than the hedging period of up to months  the subsidiaries are still subject to the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  the subsidiary results are still subject to any impact of translating the functional currency results to us dollars 
when hedging certain foreign currency transactions of a long term investment nature net investments in foreign operations  the gains and losses are recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses on other foreign exchange contracts are recognized in other income or expense as exchange rates change 
for purposes of potential risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the fair values of our hedge portfolio related to firmly committed or forecasted transactions 
the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction 
as of december  and  a appreciation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in increases of million and million in the fair value of the hedge portfolio  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in decreases of million and million in the fair value of the hedge portfolio as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities at december  was not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in  we swapped a portion of our senior unsecured notes from the fixed rate to a variable rate 
the swap is described in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we utilize non exchange traded financial instruments  such as foreign exchange forward contracts that we purchase exclusively from highly rated financial institutions 
we record these contracts on our balance sheet at fair market value based upon market price quotations from the financial institutions 
we do not enter into non exchange traded contracts that require the use of fair value estimation techniques  but if we did  they could have a material impact on our financial results 
also  we do not enter into hedges for speculative purposes 
we are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments  such as hedging instruments  short term investments  and cash and cash equivalents 
credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
the maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals  credit limits  selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions and monitoring procedures 
our business often involves large transactions with customers for which we do not require collateral 
if one or more of those customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses 
moreover  a downturn in the global economy could have an adverse impact on the ability of our customers to pay their obligations on a timely basis 
we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate 
at december  and  we did not have any major concentration of credit risk related to financial instruments
