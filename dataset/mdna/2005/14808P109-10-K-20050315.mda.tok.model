item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cass information systems  inc provides payment and information processing services to national manufacturing  distribution and retail enterprises from its processing centers in st 
louis  missouri  columbus  ohio  boston  massachusetts and greenville  south carolina 
the company s services include freight invoice rating  payment processing  auditing  and the generation of cost accounting and transportation information 
cass also processes and pays utility invoices  including electricity  gas and telecommunications 
the company significantly enhanced its telecommunication processing and audit capabilities with the acquisition of profitlab  inc located in greenville  south carolina during cass extracts  stores and presents information from freight  utility and telecommunication invoices  assisting our customers transportation  energy and information technology managers in making decisions that will enable them to improve operating performance 
the company receives data from multiple sources  electronic and otherwise  and processes the data to accomplish the specific operating requirements of its customers 
it then provides the data in a central repository for access and archiving 
the data is finally transformed into information through the company s databases that allow client interaction as required and provide internet based tools for analytical processing 
the company also  through its st louis  missouri based bank subsidiary  provides banking services in the st louis metropolitan area and other selected cities in the united states 
the company acquired franklin bancorp located in orange county  california in november and merged its subsidiary bank  franklin bank of california into the bank 
this acquisition will allow the company to establish branches in california to better serve existing customers and expand the bank s customer base 
in addition to supporting the company s payment operations  the bank also provides banking services to its target markets  which include privately owned businesses and churches and church related ministries 
the company  through the bank s subsidiary  gems  also develops and licenses integrated financial  property and human resource management systems to the public sector 
the specific payment and information processing services provided to each customer are developed individually to meet each customer s specific requirements 
these requirements can vary greatly from customer to customer 
in addition  the degree of automation such as electronic data interchange edi  imaging  and web enhanced solutions varies greatly among customers and industries 
these factors combine so that pricing varies greatly among the customer base 
in general however  cass is compensated for its processing services through service fees and account balances that are generated during the payment process 
the amount  type and calculation of service fees vary greatly by service offering  but generally follow the volume of transactions processed 
interest income from the balances generated during the payment processing cycle is affected by the amount of time cass holds the funds prior to payment and the dollar volume processed 
both the number of transactions processed and the dollar volume processed are therefore key metrics followed by management 
other factors will also influence revenue and profitability  such as changes in the general level of interest rates which has a significant affect on net interest income 
the funds generated by these processing activities are invested in overnight investments  investment grade securities and loans generated by the bank 
the bank earns most of its revenue from net interest income  or the difference between the interest earned on its loans and investments and the interest expense on its deposits 
the bank also assesses fees on other services such as cash management services 
gems earns most of its revenue from the license of its enterprise software solutions and its installation and maintenance services 
industry wide factors that impact the company include the acceptance by large corporations of the outsourcing of key business functions such as freight  utility and telecommunication payment and audit 
the benefits that can be achieved by outsourcing transaction processing and the management information generated by cass systems can be influenced by factors such as the competitive pressures within industries to improve profitability  the general level of transportation costs  deregulation of energy costs and consolidation of telecommunication providers 
economic factors that impact the company include the general level of economic activity that can affect the volume and size of invoices processed  the ability to hire and retain qualified staff and the growth and quality of our loan portfolio 
the general level of interest rates has a significant effect on the revenue of the company 
finally  the general fiscal condition of the counties and municipalities that can benefit from gems enterprise software can impact licenses sold and related revenue 
currently  management views cass major opportunity and challenge as the continued expansion of its payment and information processing service offerings and customer base 
management intends to accomplish this by maintaining the company s lead in applied technology  which  when combined with the security and processing controls of the bank  makes cass unique in the industry 
this trend has been positive over the past years and management anticipates that this should continue in the low level of interest rates has had a significant negative impact on net income over the past few years 
the general level of interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  began to increase during and had a positive effect on the company s net interest income during the latter part of the year 
if these rates continue to rise  this positive impact on net interest income and net earnings should continue 
management had been pleased over the past few years with the growth in revenue generated by gems 
however  during  the sales of new systems declined sharply due mainly to a sluggish marketplace 
despite the decline  the company continues to invest in system improvements and product enhancements and anticipates that should reflect improved results 
management intends to continue to refine risk management practices  monitor and manage the quality of the loan portfolio and maintain a strong financial and liquidity position 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this report in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates have been generally accurate in the past  they have been consistent and have not required any material changes 
there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and are described below 
allowance for loan losses 
the company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to assess overall collectability 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
although these estimates are based on established methodologies for determining allowance requirements  actual results can differ significantly from estimated results 
these policies affect all segments of the company with the exception of governmental software services 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed in the allowance and provision for loan losses section of this report 
impairment of assets 
management periodically evaluates certain long term assets such as intangible assets including goodwill  foreclosed assets  internally developed software and investments in private equity securities for impairment 
generally  these assets are initially recorded at cost  and recognition of impairment is required when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets will not be recoverable in the future 
if impairment occurs  various methods of measuring impairment may be called for depending on the circumstances and type of asset  including quoted market prices  estimates based on similar assets  and estimates based on valuation techniques such as discounted projected cash flows 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
these policies affect all segments of the company and require significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different results if conditions or underlying circumstances change 
results of operations the results of compared to include the following significant items information services payment and processing revenues increased  or to  as the number of transactions processed increased  or to  this increase was driven by the expansion of the company s customer base and number of services offered 
net interest income after provision for loan losses increased  or to  due primarily to the increase in average earning assets of  or to  this increase included an increase in total average loans of  or to  an increase in average investments of  or to  and an increase in average federal funds sold and other short term investments of  or to  the growth in average earning assets was derived from both increases in deposits and accounts and drafts payable 
interest income  derived from the increase in earning assets  was partially offset by an increase in interest paid on deposit liabilities  due to both an increase in balances and an increase in rates paid 
gains from the sale of securities decreased  compared to last year   in and  in revenue generated from the company s software subsidiary declined  or to  due primarily to a decrease in license fees generated from new customers as the market for governmental software appears to have softened from the previous year 
bank service fees decreased  or to  due primarily to the fact that as the earnings credit rate granted customers on their account balances increases with the general level of interest rates  the amount of service fees charged decreases 
other income decreased  or to  due mainly to a decrease in revenue generated from the investment in bank owned life insurance during operating expenses increased a modest  or less than to  despite the additional expenses generated from the acquisition of profitlab  inc the results of compared to include the following significant items information services payment and processing revenue increased  or to  as the number of transactions processed increased  or to  this increase was driven by the expansion of the company s customer base and number of services provided as well as an increase in national freight activity during the second half of the year 
net interest income after provision for loan losses decreased  or to  due to the dramatic decline in interest rates during the past few years 
this decline occurred despite the fact that total average loans  typically the company s highest yielding asset for any given maturity  grew  or to  and average earning assets grew  or to  the growth in average earning assets was derived from both increases in deposits and accounts and drafts payable 
gains from the sale of securities were comparable to last year   in and  in on january   the company reclassified the foreclosed assets relating to its software subsidiary  gems  from held for sale to held and used and consolidated its operations into those of the bank subsidiary 
on january   the company s bank subsidiary foreclosed on these operating assets in order to protect its financial interests 
the bank sold these assets to a wholly owned subsidiary  and invested in and stabilized this business 
from the date of foreclosure through december   these assets were accounted for as a foreclosed asset held for sale 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  adopted by the company on january   requires that if certain criteria are not met for long lived asset disposal groups classified as held for sale by the end of the fiscal year in which sfas is initially applied  the related long lived assets shall be reclassified as held and used 
in revenues for this segment were  and operating profits were bank service fees increased  or to  due primarily to the fact that as the earnings credit rate granted customers on their account balances decreases with the general level of interest rates  the amount of service fees charged increases 
other income increased  or to  due mainly to an investment in bank owned life insurance during operating expenses  excluding the effects of the gems consolidation  increased a modest  or to  due mainly to increases in salaries and health and worker s compensation insurance expenses 
fee revenue and other income the company s fee revenue is derived mainly from freight and utility payment and processing fees 
as the company provides its processing and payment services  it is compensated by service fees which are typically calculated on a per item basis and by the accounts and drafts payable balances generated in the payment process which can be used to generate interest income 
processing volumes related to fees and accounts and drafts payable for the years ended december   and are as follows december  change in thousands v v freight invoice transaction volume    
freight invoice dollar volume    utility transaction volume    utility transaction dollar volume    payment and processing revenue    fee revenue and other income in compared to include the following significant pre tax components transaction volume from the transportation information services increased slightly due mainly to increased activity from existing clients 
there was also a change in mix from lower priced  simple transactions to higher priced  complex transactions 
total dollar volume processed from this division increased during this period due to increased activity from existing clients and larger average freight charges 
fees for the period grew due to the increased volume and additional services provided 
the increase in volume and fees from the utility information services division increased primarily due to new customers as the growth of this segment continues 
the acquisition of profitlab  inc contributed  of payment and processing fees for software revenue decreased  or to  this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in license fee revenue generated from new customer sales 
although revenue generated by gems increased in each of the past three years  sales were off significantly in as the market for governmental software appears to have decreased from the prior years 
bank service fees decreased  or to  this decrease was due primarily to the fact that service fees decrease as the credit allowance for noninterest bearing deposits increases  due to the general level of interest rate increases 
during the company recorded net gains of  on the sales of securities with a fair value of  during  net gains of  were recorded on the sales of securities with a fair value of  these sales of securities were made to adjust the portfolio to reflect the changes in the interest rate environment  growth in the loan portfolio during the past two years and to offset the loss of interest income due to the dramatic decline in the general level of interest rates 
other income decreased  or to  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income recognized from the increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance purchased by the company in fee revenue and other income in compared to include the following significant pre tax components information services payment and processing fee revenue increased  or to  these increases both relate to new customers and new product offerings 
utility processing volume and revenue  which represents a newer market  had higher percentage increases 
software revenue in of  represents the revenue of the bank s software subsidiary gems  which develops and licenses integrated financial  property and human resource management systems to the public sector 
prior to december   gems was accounted for as an asset held for sale and its operating results were not consolidated with those of the company 
sfas  adopted by the company in  now requires that gems be reclassified as an asset held and used 
consequently  cass reclassified the entity s net assets and consolidated its operations with the parent company on january  although unconsolidated in and  software revenue was  and  respectively 
bank service fees increased  or to  this increase was due primarily to the fact that service fees increase as the credit allowance for noninterest bearing deposits decreases  due to the general level of interest rate decreases 
during the company recorded net gains of  on the sales of securities with a fair value of  during  net gains of  were recorded on the sales of securities with a fair value of  these sales of securities were made to adjust the portfolio to reflect the changes in the interest rate environment  growth in the loan portfolio during the past two years and to offset the loss of interest income due to the dramatic decline in the general level of interest rates 
other income increased  or to  this increase was primarily due to income recognized from the increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance purchased by the company in net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans  investments  and other earning assets and interest expense on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is a significant source of the company s revenues 
the following table summarizes the changes in net interest income and related factors for the three periods ended december   and change change dollars in thousands v 
v 
average earning assets    net interest income    net interest margin yield on earning assets rate on interest bearing liabilities net interest income in compared to the increase in net interest income was caused by the significant increase in earning assets that exceeded the decline in net interest margin 
this increase in earning assets was funded by both an increase in accounts and drafts payable due to the increased dollars processed and an increase in bank deposits due to the expansion of the banks customer base 
the company is negatively affected by decreases in the level of interest rates due to the fact that its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  the company is positively affected by increases in the level of interest rates 
this is primarily due to the noninterest bearing liabilities generated by the company in the form of accounts and drafts payable 
despite the slight increase in interest rates during the second half of the net interest margin was lower than in due to the decreases over the past few years and the fact that changes in interest rates affect some earning assets such as federal funds sold and floating rate loans immediately and some earning assets  such as fixed rate loans and municipal bonds  over time 
this decrease in net interest margin was also negatively impacted by an increase in rates paid on deposits 
more information is contained in the tables below and in item a of this report 
total average loans increased  or to  this increase was attributable to new business relationships 
loans have a positive effect on interest income and the net interest margin due to the fact that loans are one of the company s highest yielding earning assets for any given maturity 
total average investment in debt and equity securities increased  or to  as the company invested part of the increase in deposits and payables 
total average federal funds sold and other short term investments increased  or to  this increase was also funded by the increase in accounts and drafts payable and growth in bank deposits and provides the company with additional liquidity to take advantage of higher interest rates 
the increase in both interest bearing liabilities and rates paid on deposits partially offsets the increases achieved by an increase in earning assets 
interest bearing deposits increased  or due to the bank s marketing efforts to increase its customer base 
rates paid on the deposits increased from to 
this resulted in an increase of  or in interest paid on deposits 
net interest income in compared to the decrease in net interest income and margin was primarily due to the dramatic decrease in the general level of interest rates over the past few years 
the prime rate decreased from at the beginning of to at the end of and the year treasury note rate decreased from to during this same period 
the company is negatively affected by decreases in the level of interest rates due to the fact that its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  the company is positively affected by increases in the level of interest rates 
this is primarily due to the noninterest bearing liabilities generated by the company in the form of accounts and drafts payable 
changes in interest rates will affect some earning assets such as federal funds sold and floating rate loans immediately and some earning assets  such as fixed rate loans and municipal bonds  over time 
more information is contained in the tables below and item a of this report 
the company partially offset the decrease in net interest income through both an increase in earning assets and shift of earning assets to higher yielding asset classes 
total average earning assets increased  or to  this increase was funded by both an increase in accounts and drafts payable due to the increase in payments processed and an increase in bank deposits due to the expansion of the banks customer base 
total average loans increased  or to  this increase was attributable to new business relationships and was funded by the increase in accounts and drafts payable  growth in bank deposits and reallocation of earning assets from the investment portfolio 
although not enough to offset the decline in the level of interest rates  this increase in loans had a positive effect on interest income and the net interest margin due to the fact that loans are one of the company s highest yielding earning assets for any given maturity 
total average investment in debt and equity securities decreased  or to  this decrease was used partially to fund the increase in loans and partially shifted into federal funds sold and overnight investments

the loan portfolio was  and represented of the company s total assets as of december  and generated  in revenue during the year then ended 
the following tables shows the composition of the loan portfolio at the end of the periods indicated and remaining maturities for loans as of december  loans by type at december dollars in thousands commercial and industrial      real estate mortgage      construction      industrial revenue bonds      installment      other      total loans      loans by maturity at december  over year over through years years one year fixed floating fixed floating dollars in thousands or less rate rate rate rate total commercial and industrial     real estate mortgage     construction    industrial revenue bonds    installment   other   total loans      loans have been classified as having floating interest rates if the rate specified in the loan varies with the prime commercial rate of interest 
the company has no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans  which are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table and discussed in item  note of this report 
as can be seen in the loan composition table above and discussed in item  note  the company s primary market niche for banking services is privately held businesses and churches and church related ministries 
loans to commercial entities are generally secured by the business assets of the company  including accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  and the real estate from which the company operates 
operating lines of credit to these companies generally are secured by accounts receivable and inventory  with specific percentages of each determined on a customer by customer basis based on various factors including the type of business 
intermediate term credit for machinery and equipment is generally provided at some percentage of the value of the equipment purchased  depending on the type of machinery or equipment purchased by the entity 
loans secured exclusively by real estate to businesses and churches are generally made with a maximum loan to value ratio  depending upon the company s estimate of the resale value and ability of the property to generate cash 
the company s loan policy requires an independent appraisal for all loans over  secured by real estate 
company management monitors the local economy in an attempt to determine whether it has had a significant deteriorating effect on such real estate credits 
when problems are identified  appraised values are updated on a continual basis  either internally or through an updated external appraisal 
loan portfolio changes from december  to december  total loans increased  or to  this increase was due to both the expansion of church and church related loans located throughout the country and commercial and construction loans in the st 
louis metropolitan area 
at year end  church and church related real estate and construction credits totaled  which represents a increase over additional details regarding the types and maturities of loans in the loan portfolio are contained in the tables above and in item  note loan portfolio changes from december  to december  total loans increased  or to  this increase was due mainly to the expansion of church and church related loans in the st 
louis metropolitan area and selected areas across the united states 
at year end  church and church related real estate and construction credits totaled  which represented a increase over additional details regarding the types and maturities of the loan portfolio are contained in the tables above and in item  note provision and allowance for loan losses the company recorded a provision for loan losses of  in   in and  in the amount of the provisions were derived from the company s quarterly analysis of the allowance for loan losses in relation to probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the larger provision made in was primarily the result of the risks inherent in an expanding loan portfolio and reserves made for specific problem loans 
the larger provision made in partially resulted from risks inherent with the increase in average loans outstanding and an increase in nonperforming loans 
the amount of the provision will fluctuate as determined by these quarterly analyses 
the company had net loan charge offs of  in  net loan recoveries of  in and net loan charge offs of  in the allowance for loan losses was  at december   compared to  at december  and  at december  the year end allowance represented of outstanding loans  compared to at year end and at year end from december  to december  the level of nonperforming loans decreased  from  to  which represents 
of outstanding loans 
nonperforming loans are more fully explained in the section entitled nonperforming assets 
the allowance for loan losses has been established and is maintained to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing assessment of risk of loss is performed to determine if the current balance of the allowance is adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
a charge or credit is made to expense to cover any deficiency or reduce any excess 
the current methodology employed to determine the appropriate allowance consists of two components  specific and general 
the company develops specific valuation allowances on commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans based on individual review of these loans and our estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and collection options available to us 
the general component relates to all other loans  which are evaluated based on loan grade 
the loan grade assigned to each loan is typically evaluated on an annual basis  unless circumstances require interim evaluation 
the company assigns a reserve amount consistent with each loan s rating category 
the reserve amount is based on derived loss experience over prescribed periods 
in addition to the amounts derived from the loan grades  a portion is added to the general reserve to take into account other factors including national and local economic conditions  downturns in specific industries including loss in collateral value  trends in credit quality at the company and the banking industry  and trends in risk rating changes 
as part of their examination process  federal and state agencies review the company s methodology for maintaining the allowance for loan losses and the balance in the account 
these agencies may require the company to increase the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and interpretations about information available to them at the time of their examination

nonperforming assets it is the policy of the company to continually monitor its loan portfolio and to discontinue the accrual of interest on any loan on which payment of principal or interest in a timely manner  in the normal course of business  is doubtful 
subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to principal if there is any doubt as to the collectibility of such principal  otherwise  these receipts are recorded as interest income 
interest on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans  which would have been recorded under the original terms of the loans  was approximately  for the year ended december  of this amount  approximately  was actually recorded as interest income on such loans 
the total renegotiated loans of  at december  relates to one borrower that is current under the new terms of the loan

at december   approximately  of loans not included in the table below were identified by management as having potential credit problems 
these loans are excluded from the table due to the fact they are current under the original terms of the loans  however circumstances have raised doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the current loan repayment terms 
included in this balance is  related to one borrower that was renegotiated in and although current under the new terms of the contract management believes  due to the financial condition of the company  there still remains risk as to the collectability of all amounts under the loan agreement 
the company does not have any foreign loans 
the company s loan portfolio does not include a significant amount of single family real estate mortgage or installment credits  as the company does not market its services to retail customers

this additional commitment has funded and the total investment of the company in this entity was  at december  and  at december  at december  the company had a ownership interest in this entity and the chairman and ceo of the company was a member of the entity s board of directors 
in addition  the company has extended a  line of credit for working capital purposes to this entity  with a interest sold to a new non affiliated majority owner 
as of december  the company s interest in this line amounted to  and all payments are current 
this business has performed poorly during the past few years and the new majority owner is currently in the process of stabilizing the business and improving its financial performance 
however  should this business fail to meet its objectives  the company s investment could be subject to future impairment 
the company accounts for this investment  along with its other non marketable equity investments  under the cost method 
under the cost method of accounting  investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings and additional investments 
the company periodically evaluates whether any declines in fair value of its investments are other than temporary 
in performing this evaluation  the company considers various factors including any decline in market price  where available  the investee s financial condition  results of operations  operating trends and other financial ratios 
deposits and accounts and drafts payable noninterest bearing demand deposits decreased  or from december  to  at december  the average balances of these deposits increased  or from december  to  at december  the decrease in ending balances relates to normal daily fluctuations in these accounts 
interest bearing deposits increased  or from december  to  at december  the average balances of these deposits increased  or from to  in these increases relate mainly to the bank s increased marketing efforts to attract more deposits 
accounts and drafts payable generated by the company in its payment processing operations increased  or from december  to  at december  the average balances of these funds increased  or from to  in these increases relate to the increase in dollars processed 
due to the company s payment processing cycle  average balances are much more indicative of the underlying activity than period end balances since point in time comparisons can be misleading if the comparison dates fall on different days of the week 
the composition of average deposits and the average rates paid on those deposits is represented in the table entitled distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  interest rate and interest differential which is included earlier in this discussion 
the company does not have any significant deposits from foreign depositors 
maturities of certificates of deposits of  or more at december  dollars in thousands three months or less  three to six months  six to twelve months  over twelve months  total  short term borrowings short term borrowings increased  or from december  to  at december  average balances of these funds decreased  or from to  during these funds consist primarily of federal funds purchased and can also include tax deposits of the us treasury 
these balances can vary significantly from day to day due to the company s payment cycle and therefore balances on any particular day are not necessarily reflective of balances throughout the year 
for more information on borrowings please refer to item  note of this report 
subordinated convertible debentures total subordinated convertible debentures at december  were  and average balances of these funds were  for the year 
the debentures were issued on august  as part of the company purchase of profitlab  inc the company had no outstanding debentures in for more information on these debentures please refer to item  note of this report 
liquidity the discipline of liquidity management as practiced by the company seeks to ensure that funds are available to fulfill all payment obligations relating to the freight and utility invoices processed as they become due  meet depositor withdrawal requests and borrower credit demands while at the same time maximizing profitability 
this is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in the supply of funds 
primary liquidity to meet demand is provided by short term liquid assets that can be converted to cash  maturing securities and the ability to obtain funds from external sources 
the company s asset liability committee alco has direct oversight responsibility for the company s liquidity position and profile 
management considers both on balance sheet and off balance sheet items in its evaluation of liquidity 
the balances of liquid assets consists of cash and cash equivalents  which include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  and money market funds  and were  at december   an increase of  or from december  at december  these assets represented of total assets 
these funds are the company s and its subsidiaries primary source of liquidity to meet future expected and unexpected loan demand  depositor withdrawals or reductions in accounts and drafts payable 
secondary sources of liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing lines 
total investment in debt and equity securities was  at december   an increase of  or from december  these assets represented of total assets at december  of this total  were state and political subdivision securities  were us treasury securities  were us government agencies and were other securities 
of the total portfolio  mature in one year  matures in one to five years  and matures in five or more years 
during the year the company sold securities with a market value of  and a portion of these funds were reinvested in state and political subdivision securities and the loan portfolio 
the bank has unsecured lines at correspondent banks to purchase federal funds up to a maximum of  additionally  the bank maintains lines of credit at unaffiliated financial institutions in the maximum amount of  collateralized by us treasury and agency securities and commercial and residential mortgage loans 
the deposits of the company s banking subsidiary have historically been stable  consisting of a sizable volume of core deposits related to customers that utilize many other commercial products of the bank 
the accounts and drafts payable generated by the company has also historically been a stable source of funds 
the company also maintains a treasury stock buyback program pursuant to which the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
the company did not repurchase any shares during and repurchased  shares for  in as of december    shares remained available for repurchase under the program 
repurchases are made in the open market or through negotiated transactions from time to time depending on market conditions 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for the years  and were   and  respectively 
net income plus the adjustment for depreciation and amortization accounts for most of the operating cash provided 
net cash flows from investing and financing activities fluctuate greatly as the company actively manages its investment and loan portfolios and customer activity influences changes in deposit and accounts and drafts payable balances 
further analysis of the changes in these account balances is discussed earlier in this report 
due to the daily fluctuations in these account balances  the analysis of changes in average balances  also discussed earlier in this report  can be more indicative of underlying activity than the period end balances used in the statements of cash flows 
management anticipates that cash and cash equivalents  maturing investments and cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital expenditures in capital resources one of management s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital base to warrant the confidence of customers  shareholders  and bank regulatory agencies 
a strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and creditors 
the company and its banking subsidiary continue to exceed all regulatory capital requirements  as evidenced by the capital ratios at december  as shown in item  note of this report 
in  cash dividends paid were 
per share for a total of  a increase over the prior year  which is attributable to an increase in the per share amount paid and additional shares outstanding 
on february  the company declared a stock dividend payable to holders of record on march  shareholders equity was  or of total assets  at december   an increase of  over the balance at december  this increase resulted from net income of  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  and other items of  which was partially offset by cash dividends paid of  a decrease in other comprehensive income of  and payment of  related to the stock dividend 
dividends from the bank subsidiary are a significant source of funds for payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders 
the only restrictions on dividends are those dictated by regulatory capital requirements and prudent and sound banking principles 
as of december   unappropriated retained earnings of  were available at the bank for the declaration of dividends to the company without prior approval from regulatory authorities 
commitments  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company is party to activities that contain credit  market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the company s consolidated financial statements 
such activities include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments and commitments under operating and capital leases 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
the company s maximum potential exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments 
at december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses for these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company or its subsidiaries to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
these off balance sheet financial instruments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
at december  the balance of loan commitments  commercial and standby letters of credit were   and  respectively 
since some of the financial instruments may expire without being drawn upon  the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are subject to the same underwriting standards as those financial instruments included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary upon extension of the credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies  but is generally accounts receivable  inventory  residential or income producing commercial property or equipment 
in the event of nonperformance  the company or its subsidiaries may obtain and liquidate the collateral to recover amounts paid under its guarantees on these financial instruments 
on august  the company issued  in subordinated convertible debentures as part of the company s acquisition of profitlab  inc interest  at a rate of  is payable annually on the anniversary date of the acquisition 
the holders of the debentures can convert the principal amount into fully paid and non assessable shares of the common stock of the company at a rate per share of at various amounts over a year period  at which time the securities mature 
the debentures may be called by the company without penalty after august  for more information on the acquisition please refer to item  notes and of this report

during  the company contributed  to its noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
the contribution had no significant effect on the company s overall liquidity 
in determining pension expense  the company makes several assumptions  including the discount rate and long term rate of return on assets 
these assumptions are determined at the beginning of the plan year based on interest rate levels and financial market performance 
for these assumptions were as follows weighted average discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels expected long term rate of return on assets effect of recent and prospective accounting pronouncements in  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf  which provides guidance to assess whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security is impaired on an other than temporary basis 
factors to consider include the length of time the security has had a market value less than the cost basis  the intent and ability of the company to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value  recent events specific to the issuer or industry and for debt securities  external credit rating and recent downgrades 
securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other than temporary are written down to fair value with the write down recorded as a realized loss 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb announced that it will reconsider in its entirety all guidance on disclosing  measuring and recognizing other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities 
until new guidance is issued  companies must continue to comply with the disclosure requirements of eitf and all relevant measurement and recognition requirements in other accounting literature 
the disclosure requirements required under eitf are included in item  note of this report 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaced  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 fin issued in january companies are required to apply fin r to variable interest entities vies created after december  for variable interest in vies created before january   fin r will be applied beginning on january  the company is currently not a primary beneficiary of a vie and therefore the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits sfas revised  which increases the disclosure requirements of the original statement by requiring more details about pension plan assets  benefit obligations  cash flows  benefit costs and related information and also requires companies to disclose various elements of pension and postretirement benefit costs in interim period financial statements for quarters beginning after december  additional disclosures pertaining to benefit payments are required for fiscal years ending after june  the disclosure requirements of sfas revised are included in item  note of this report 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaced  accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see the section entitled stock options of this item  note for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for fiscal through fiscal  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and do not expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and its fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the asset liability management discipline as applied by the company seeks to limit the volatility  to the extent possible  of both net interest income and the fair market value of equity that can result from changes in market interest rates 
this is accomplished by limiting the maturities of fixed rate investments  loans  and deposits  matching fixed rate assets and liabilities to the extent possible  and optimizing the mix of fees and net interest income 
however  as discussed below  the company s asset liability position differs significantly from most other bank holding companies with significant positive cumulative gaps shown for each time horizon presented 
this asset sensitive position is caused primarily by the operations of the company  which generates large balances of accounts and drafts payable 
these balances  which are noninterest bearing  contribute to the company s historical high net interest margin but cause the company to become susceptible to changes in interest rates  with a decreasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of declining interest rates and an increasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of rising interest rates 
the company s alco measures the company s interest rate risk sensitivity on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage the variability of earnings and fair market value of equity in various interest rate environments 
the alco evaluates the company s risk position to determine whether the level of exposure is significant enough to hedge a potential decline in earnings and value or whether the company can safely increase risk to enhance returns 
the alco uses gap reports  twelve month net interest income simulations  and fair market value of equity analyses as its main analytical tools to provide management with insight into the company s exposure to changing interest rates 
management uses a gap report to review any significant mismatch between the repricing points of the company s rate sensitive assets and liabilities in certain time horizons 
a negative gap indicates that more liabilities reprice in that particular time frame and  if rates rise  these liabilities will reprice faster than the assets 
a positive gap would indicate the opposite 
gap reports can be misleading in that they capture only the repricing timing within the balance sheet  and fail to capture other significant risks such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
basis risk involves the potential for the spread relationship between rates to change under different rate environments and embedded options risk relates to the potential for the alteration of the level and or timing of cash flows given changes in rates 
another measurement tool used by management is net interest income simulation  which forecasts net interest income during the coming twelve months under different interest rate scenarios in order to quantify potential changes in short term accounting income 
management has set policy limits specifying acceptable levels of interest rate risk given multiple simulated rate movements 
these simulations are more informative than gap reports because they are able to capture more of the dynamics within the balance sheet  such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
a table containing simulation results as of december  from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates is shown below 
while net interest income simulations do a good job of capturing interest rate risk to short term earnings  they do not capture risk within the current balance sheet beyond twelve months 
the company uses fair market value of equity analyses to help identify longer term risk that may reside on the current balance sheet 
the fair market value of equity is represented by the present value of all future income streams generated by the current balance sheet 
the company measures the fair market value of equity as the net present value of all asset and liability cash flows discounted at forward rates suggested by the current treasury curve plus appropriate credit spreads 
this representation of the change in the fair market value of equity under different rate scenarios gives insight into the magnitude of risk to future earnings due to rate changes 
management has set policy limits relating to declines in the market value of equity
