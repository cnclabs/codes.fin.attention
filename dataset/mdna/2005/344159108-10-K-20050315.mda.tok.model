item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect future results discussions of certain matters in this annual report on form k may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  and as such  may involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies  and expectations  are generally identifiable by the use of words or phrases such as believe  plan  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  forecast  may increase  may fluctuate  may improve and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will  should  would  and could 
in particular  statements contained in this document that are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning anticipated revenues  anticipated operating expense levels  potential new products and orders  and such expense levels relative to our total revenues constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the availability of capital to fund our future cash needs  reliance on major customers  history of operating losses  market acceptance of our products  technological obsolescence  competition  successful integration of acquisitions  component supply problems  protection of proprietary information  the unpredictability of costs to develop new technologies  as well as the accuracy of our internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
for a discussion of these factors and some of the factors that might cause such a difference see also risk factors 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
we do not undertake  and specifically disclaims any obligation  to update any forward looking statements to reflect occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contract revenues  customer programs and incentives  product returns  accounts receivable allowances  inventory valuation allowances  warranty accruals  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  recoverability of capitalized software development costs  the value of equity instruments issued for services  the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for product returns based primarily on historical return rates  return policies and price protection arrangements 
in addition  we sometimes accept returns for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations to customers  which includes price discounts  credits and returns  when demand for specific products falls below expectations 
if market conditions were to decline  we could experience an increase in the volume of returns 
however  only a limited number of consumer channel distributors have return rights 
in connection with these agreements  distributors may return or exchange slow moving inventory held by that distributor 
however  these return rights are limited to of the customer s prior quarter purchases 
we recognize contract revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we use this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of the contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as a contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision became known 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness and past transaction history with the customer 
although collateral is generally not requested  in certain situations we will require confirmed letters of credit or cash in advance of shipping to our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our policy on capitalized software costs determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or cost of revenues 
we use professional judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
our business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the possible future impairment expense that we may incur  and in the case of intangible assets  the amount of future period amortization expense 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations overview the year was a year of substantial product investment 
our systems group introduced nine new products during the year  including new versions of our mx series of video mixers and firestore direct to edit recorders 
we also made two acquisitions 
we acquired como  located in kiel  germany  in february enabling us to establish a european sales and support office 
in addition to como s complementary video production products  como s line of digital asset management products has enabled us to enter the professional video production storage and retrieval market 
in may  we acquired the assets of visual circuits  located in minneapolis  minnesota  to enter the digital signage market 
we hope to couple both added capabilities with our extensive distribution channels 
our semiconductor group continued to add customers for our extensive offering of scan conversion chips  including those in the set top box market  as well as for new markets such as portable phones and dvd players 
however  the majority of our semiconductors group s resources were directed and invested in the development of our uwb technology 
the semiconductor group increased its staffing by employees from the year ended december  in connection with its work on uwb 
the group also entered into development arrangements with various companies to assist with the design and manufacture of our uwb chips 
as such  our semiconductor s research and development expenses increased million  or  from additionally  we purchased million of property and equipment  compared to only  in  related primarily to support our uwb development 
during  sales of our fs  which were primarily to microsoft  decreased approximately million to million  compared to million in the year ended this significant decrease in revenue combined with our continued significant investment in research and development  primarily uwb  resulted in a net loss of million 
as a result of these and other factors  we are not yet profitable 
therefore  during the year we raised net proceeds of million through the issuance of common stock in private placements to various non affiliated investors 
in addition  we secured an accounts receivable based line of credit under which we can borrow up to million 
although we ended with cash and cash equivalents of million  we will require additional funds during in order to meet all currently planned expenditures 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue years ended december  increase increase dollars in thousands decrease decrease system products semiconductor products revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million compared with the year ended december  for the year ended december   sales of system products were approximately million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase in sales of our systems products mainly reflects sales of products of approximately million resulting from the acquisitions of como in february and visual circuits in may  as well as the introduction of new products  including new variations of firestore  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our consumer scan conversion and mixer products 
revenue from mixer product sales has been trending lower from previous years as video enthusiasts move from stand alone editing systems to computer based or non linear editing systems 
also contributing to the decrease in mixer revenue in was the discontinuation of third party components and our inability to redesign our product in a timely manner 
these delays resulted in periods during the third and fourth quarters of when we were without certain mixer products 
by january  we had redesigned and were shipping two new mixer products  thereby replacing the two previously discontinued mixer products 
our consumer scan conversion product sales have decreased as an increasing number of personal computers and televisions now incorporate scan conversion technology 
sales of semiconductor products to distributors and oem customers were approximately million in the year ended december   compared to million for the million decrease in sales of semiconductor products mainly reflects significantly reduced sales of our fs chip to microsoft  which was for use in microsoft s xbox 
in january  microsoft ceased placing significant orders for our fs product 
shipments of the fs  which were primarily to microsoft  represented and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   we had a backlog of approximately million for products ordered by customers  compared to a backlog of million at december  the increase between december  and december  reflects orders for our digital video mixer and portable firestore product  offset by decreased orders of our fs chip 
gross margin years ended december  dollars in thousands decrease gross margin gross margin rate our gross margin rate for year ended december  decreased by percentage points to from in the year ended december  this decrease in the gross margin rate reflects an increase in write downs for excess and obsolete inventory of  in compared to  a charge of  associated with the subsequent sale of como and visual circuits inventory that was increased to fair value upon acquisition  amortization of developed technology of  from the acquisitions of como and visual circuits in and an accrual of  for a royalty payment based on the achievement of certain sales volumes 
these factors were partially offset by the lower amount of microsoft business in compared to  which was at below average gross margin 
sales to microsoft were made at a gross profit margin percentage of less than  primarily as a result of volume discounts provided 
operating expenses years ended december  increase dollars in thousands of revenue of revenue of revenue sales  marketing and support general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets in process research and development restructuring expense recovery sales  marketing and support sales  marketing and support expenses for year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase in sales  marketing and support expenses reflects an increase in personnel and personnel related costs of  resulting mainly from the addition of five employees  primarily from the acquisitions of como and visual circuits in february and may of  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in advertising expenditures of  general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in personnel and personnel related costs of  mainly reflecting additional headcount of five employees  primarily associated with the acquisitions of como and visual circuits  and a change in classification of certain personnel from research and development in to administrative roles in  which amount was  in also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were increases in public relations expenses of  and accounting and auditing fees of  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in research and development expenses mainly reflects additional headcount of employees  and associated expenditure  related to our investment in uwb technology and acquisitions of como and visual circuits in february and may of  respectively 
this increase in our investment in uwb technology was the primary factor that resulted in our semiconductor business increasing its research and development spending to million for compared to million for we will need significant additional capital to continue to fund the development of this technology see note  management s plans 
these increases in research and development expenses were partially offset by a change in classification of certain personnel year over year from research and development in to administrative roles in amortization amortization expense for year ended december  was  an increase of  from  for the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense reflects additional amortization expense associated with the intangible assets that resulted from the acquisitions of como in february and visual circuits in may this additional amortization expense was partially offset by the completion of amortization on certain intangible assets in restructuring expense for the year ended december   we reduced our restructuring expense accrual by  as we were able to settle amounts due on the closure of our facility in chelmsford  massachusetts  for an amount less than originally estimated 
interest expense  net and other income expense  net years ended december  dollars in thousands decrease decrease interest expense  net other income other expense other income expense  net net interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in net interest expense is primarily attributable to lower interest rates and the conversion in march of convertible promissory notes into common and preferred stock  partially offset by interest expense associated with the notes payable and line of credit assumed with the acquisition of como in february other income for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the settlement of debts for less than original amounts accrued for various trade vendor obligations that were incurred prior to the year of settlement in the normal course of business  or which pertained to liabilities assumed or related to the acquisition of videonics in we negotiated these settlements with vendors as a means of reducing our cash outflows 
tax expense benefit years ended december  dollars in thousands tax expense benefit the  tax benefit is comprised of a  tax benefit generated by our foreign subsidiary  como  offset by a  tax provision related to minimum tax payments due within the united states and foreign locations 
the  tax benefit generated by como resulted primarily from the tax benefit associated with como s operating losses and the reduction of a deferred tax liability associated with the amortization of intangible assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue years ended december  increase increase dollars in thousands decrease decrease system products semiconductor products net revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
for the year ended december   net sales of system products professional and consumer to distributors  retailers and var s were approximately million compared to million in  a decrease of  the decrease between comparison periods is primarily the result of a decrease in sales of our consumer products as a result of reduced educational spending due to budgetary constraints at the state and local level and the discontinuance of sales of certain of our products 
our systems business decreased due to the discontinuance of certain of our older products as a result of obsolete components 
this decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our newer product introductions  including firestore 
for the year ended december   net sales of semiconductor products to distributors and oem customers  which includes contract revenues  were approximately million compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase in semiconductor sales is primarily attributable to sales of our fs semiconductor chip  which were primarily to microsoft 
sales of our fs accounted for approximately million or of our total revenue for the year ended december  no such product sales were made to microsoft in the year ended december  offsetting the increase in revenues between comparison periods was a decrease in contract revenues of million  as we completed the development of an asic for microsoft  which began in june and finished in june under this development contract we recorded total revenues of million 
in january  we issued a press release indicating that we did not expect further orders from microsoft with respect to the fs chip 
gross margin years ended december  increase dollars in thousands decrease gross margin gross margin rate our gross margin rate for year ended december  decreased by percentage points from to in the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin rate primarily reflects the below average gross margin business we conducted with microsoft 
this customer represented approximately of our revenues for sales to this customer were made at a gross profit margin percentage of less than  primarily as a result of volume discounts provided 
the decrease in gross margin rate was partially offset by the decrease in amortization of capitalized software expense from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  operating expenses years ended december  dollars in thousands increase decrease of revenue of revenue of revenue sales  marketing and support general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets restructuring expense recovery sales  marketing and support sales  marketing and support expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in sales  marketing and support expenses was primarily the result of reduced advertising and tradeshow expenses as we reduced our expenses to accommodate our tight cash position 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to reduced personnel expenditures and consulting expenses 
personnel expenditures were lower year over year as our chief executive officer retired in september and was replaced by our chief operating officer  resulting in reduced executive compensation in for the year ended december   we incurred moving expenses of approximately  associated with the relocation of the chief operating officer to california and charges of approximately  associated with the issuance of warrants in connection with consulting services 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  compared to million for year ended december   an increase of  this increase in research and development expenses was primarily because no engineering work was performed under contract for the year ended december  and  as such  no research and development personnel expenses were allocated from research and development expenses to costs of revenues during such period 
for the year ended december   costs related to contract revenues  which included research and development personnel expenses  totaled  amortization amortization expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease was the result of the completion of amortization on certain intangible assets in restructuring expense for the year ended december   we reduced our restructuring expense accrual by  as we were able to settle amounts due on the closure of our facility in chelmsford  massachusetts  for an amount less than originally estimated 
for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring expenses totaling  related to the closure of our chelmsford facility 
this amount is comprised of the remaining lease obligations and property fees for the chelmsford facility 
interest expense  net and other income  net years ended december  increase increase dollars in thousands decrease decrease interest expense  net other income other expense other income  net net interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  a decrease of  the decrease in net interest expense is primarily attributable to lower interest rates and a decrease in debt obligations

other expense for the year ended december  mainly reflects a charge of  related to the repricing of warrants associated with the termination of an equity line of credit 
on july   we entered into an equity line of credit agreement with euston investments holdings limited euston 
on january   focus and euston mutually agreed to terminate the agreement 
as consideration for terminating the agreement  the exercise price of euston s warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock was reduced from to per share 
we recorded the charge of  based on the fair value of the repriced warrants 
liquidity and capital resources the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of million  million and million  respectively  and used cash in operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
these factors indicate that we may potentially be unable to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations on a timely basis  to obtain additional financing as may be required  and ultimately to return to profitability and significant positive cash flows 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the public and private sale of common stock  proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants  short term borrowings from private lenders  and credit arrangements with vendors and suppliers

the changes in working capital were mainly due to an increase in accrued liabilities of  reflecting project expenses related to our investment in uwb technology  offset by a reduction in accounts payable of  which reflected the timing of our payments 
net cash used in operating activities in consisted primarily of a net loss of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of  and other income associated with the settlement of debt of  and cash used in working capital of million 
the use of cash in working capital primarily resulted from an increase in inventory of million related mainly to inventory balances in newly introduced products  including the fs and firestore  an increase in accounts receivable of  primarily related to the increase in revenues associated with sales of the fs to microsoft  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of  and an increase in accrued liabilities of  net cash used in operating activities in of million reflected our net loss  adjusted for non cash items  of million and cash used in working capital of  non cash income statement balances included depreciation and amortization of million  deferred compensation expense of  general and administrative expenses associated with the issuance of stock and warrants for consulting and other services of  other income associated with settlement of debt totaling  and other expense associated with repricing and acceleration of warrants of  cash used in working capital mainly reflected a decrease in accounts payable of million and the payment of a legal judgment totaling million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in inventory of million 
in january  microsoft ceased placing significant orders for our fs product

the loss of this customer had a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating profit and liquidity in the year ended december   when compared to however  as the product was manufactured by one of our contract manufacturers  we did not experience any significant adjustments to our staffing or operations or significant adjustments to the carrying value of our fs inventory  as a result of the loss of the microsoft business 
we expect that our operating cash flows may fluctuate in future periods as a result of fluctuations in our operating results  shipment timetable and accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of payments among other factors

in  we received million from private equity placement transactions and  from the exercise of common stock options and warrants  partially offset by  in repayments on convertible notes to a stockholder 
capital resources and liquidity outlook we have incurred losses and used net cash in operating activities in each of the three years ended december   and as such  have been dependent upon raising money for short and long term cash needs through debt  proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants  and the sale of our common stock in private placements 
for the years ended december   and  we received net proceeds of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the sale of approximately million shares  million shares and million shares  respectively  of our common stock in private placement transactions 
in november we obtained a million credit line under which we can borrow up to of our eligible outstanding accounts receivable  excluding accounts receivable of como 
carl berg  a company director and shareholder  provided a personal guarantee to secure this credit line 
in connection with this credit line  the bank obtained a first priority security interest in our accounts receivable through an agreement with mr 
berg  which enables mr 
berg to retain his existing security interest in all of our assets while subordinating his interest in our accounts receivable 
the bank credit line is subject to ongoing covenants  including maintenance of certain liquidity ratios and operating results 
we had the ability to borrow approximately million at december  at december  there was no outstanding balance on this accounts receivable based credit line 
at december   our outstanding debt obligations consisted of notes payable of  and borrowings under a line of credit of  both of which are denominated in euros and were assumed in connection with the acquisition of como see note  borrowings 
at december   we owed mr 
berg approximately million in principal and accrued interest on various notes 
on march   mr 
berg converted the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance into common and preferred stock 
in january  microsoft ceased placing significant orders for our fs product 
shipments of the fs  which were primarily to microsoft  represented and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recorded gross margins as a percentage of sales  before commissions and selling expenses  of below relative to sales of the fs chip 
the loss of microsoft orders for the fs has had a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating profit and liquidity  especially when compared to the third and fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  as we began our initial shipments to the customer in the third quarter of and continued significant sales through the first quarter of in addition to regularly reviewing our cost structure  we have recently announced new product introductions and are continually reviewing our product lines to identify how to enhance existing  or create new  distribution channels 
there can be no assurances as to the amount of revenue these new products will produce 
we believe that we will be required to raise additional funds during in order to meet all currently planned expenditures and cash requirements through the first customer sampling of our uwb chips  which is currently scheduled to occur prior to august  this date could change because of the inherent uncertainties associated with complex engineering projects 
thereafter  depending upon the results of the sampling program  the timing and level of customer interest  and the profitability of our systems business  we may need to raise further capital and or find a partner to launch uwb products on a commercial basis 
while we have been successful in the past in raising sufficient capital to fund our operations  there can be no assurance that we will obtain sufficient financing in the future on acceptable terms to continue operations  or if we do obtain such funding  that we can do so without unduly diluting the equity interests of our current stockholders

there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be raised 
moreover  any equity financing or convertible debt would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  any additional debt financing will result in higher interest expense 
we completed the acquisitions of como and visual circuits in the first and second quarters of  respectively 
these acquisitions were effected through the issuance of common stock  and the businesses associated with these acquisitions are not currently profitable 
although in we raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock to third party investors in two private placement transactions  and secured a million line of credit based on our accounts receivable balance  we anticipate needing additional financing in  which may be met through additional sales of securities or debt 
furthermore  certain private placements could require us to pay penalties in the event privately issued securities are not timely registered for resale 
for example  as of march   we have pending a registration statement to register  shares of our common stock 
in the event the registration statement is not deemed effective on or about march   we could be subject to penalties equal to approximately  per day until the registration statement is deemed effective 
there can be no assurances when such pending registration statement will be deemed effective 
we are dependent upon a significant shareholder to meet our financing needs and there can be no assurance that this shareholder will continue to provide financing 
we have relied upon the ability of carl berg  a director and significant owner of our common stock  for interim financing needs 
at december   we had an aggregate of approximately million in debt and accrued interest outstanding to mr 
berg 
on march   mr 
berg converted this debt and accrued interest to common and preferred stock 
additionally  mr 
berg has provided a personal guarantee to samsung semiconductor inc  our contracted asic manufacturer  to secure our working capital requirements for asic purchase order fulfillment and a personal guarantee to greater bay bank in connection with our recent million accounts receivable based line of credit 
mr 
berg maintains a security interest in all the company s assets  subject to the bank s lien on our accounts receivable 
there can be no assurances that mr 
berg will continue to provide such interim financing or personal guarantees  should we need additional funds or increased credit facilities with our vendors 
we have a significant amount of convertible securities that will dilute existing stockholders upon conversion 
at december   we had  shares of preferred shares issued and outstanding  and million warrants and million options  which are all exercisable into shares of common stock 
the  shares of preferred stock are convertible into approximately million shares of our voting common stock 
see note  related party transactions 
furthermore  at december   million additional shares of common stock were available for grant to our employees  officers  directors and consultants under our current stock option and incentive plans 
we also may issue additional shares in acquisitions 
any additional grant of options under existing or future plans or issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition will further dilute existing stockholders 
any acquisitions of companies or technologies by us  including our acquisitions of como and visual circuits in  may result in distraction of our management and disruptions to our business 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise  as was the case in february when we acquired the stock of como and in may when we acquired substantially all the assets of visual circuits 
from time to time  we may engage in discussions and negotiations with companies regarding the possibility of acquiring or investing in their businesses  products  services or technologies 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates in the future  or if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we acquire or invest in another company  we could have difficulty assimilating that company s personnel  operations  technology or products and service offerings 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect the results of operations 
furthermore  we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions and or pay for the legal  accounting or finders fees  typically associated with an acquisition 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
in addition  the accounting treatment for any acquisition transaction may result in significant goodwill and intangible assets  which  if impaired  will negatively affect our consolidated results of operations 
the accounting treatment for any potential acquisition may also result in a charge for in process research and development expense  as was the case with the acquisition of visual circuits  which will negatively affect our consolidated results of operations 
we rely on certain vendors for a significant portion of our manufacturing 
approximately of the components for our products are manufactured on a turnkey basis by three vendors furthertech company ltd  btw inc and samsung semiconductor inc in addition  a single vendor in mexico assembles certain of our products 
if these vendors experience production or shipping problems for any reason  we in turn could experience delays in the production and shipping of our products  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are dependent on our suppliers 
we purchase all of our parts from outside suppliers and from time to time experience delays in obtaining some components or peripheral devices 
additionally  we are dependent on sole source suppliers for certain components 
there can be no assurance that labor problems  supply shortages or product discontinuations will not occur in the future  which could significantly increase the cost  or delay shipment  of our products  which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 
between the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of our revenue from mixer products was adversely affected by the discontinuation of certain third party components and our inability to redesign our product in a timely manner 
these delays resulted in periods when we were without certain mixer products 
by january  we had redesigned and were shipping two new mixer products  thereby replacing the two previously discontinued mixers 
if we fail to meet certain covenants in our credit facility  we may not be able to draw down on such facility and our ability to finance our operations could be adversely affected 
we have a million credit line under which we can borrow up to of our eligible outstanding accounts receivable 
the various agreements in connection with such credit line require us to maintain certain covenants 
for example  we are required to maintain certain financial covenants  including maintenance of certain liquidity ratios and operating results 
in the event we are not able to obtain a waiver for any covenant violation  and or remain out of compliance with a particular covenant  we will not be able to draw down on the line of credit  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation 
furthermore  the restrictions contained in the line of credit documents  as well as the terms of other indebtedness we may incur from time to time  could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans 
these restrictions could also adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or other capital needs  or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest 
we depend on a few customers for a high percentage of our revenues and the loss or failure to pay of any one of these customers could result in a substantial decline in our revenues and profits 
for the year ended december   our largest five customers in aggregate provided of our total revenues and as of december  comprised of our accounts receivable balance 
we presently have no reason to believe that these customers lack the financial resources to pay 
we do not have long term contracts requiring any customer to purchase any minimum amount of products 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive orders of the same magnitude as in the past from existing customers or will be able to market our current or proposed products to new customers 
the loss of any major customer  the failure of any such identified customer to pay us  or to discontinue issuance of additional purchase orders  would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  results of operation  and business as a whole  absent the timely replacement of the associated revenues and profit margins associated with such business 
furthermore  many of our products are dependent upon the overall success of our customers products  over which we often have no control 
to that point  in january  microsoft ceased placing significant orders for our fs product 
shipments of the fs  which were primarily to microsoft  represented of our total revenues for the year ended december  while it only represented of our total revenues for the year ended december  the loss of microsoft orders for the fs has had a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating profit and liquidity  especially when compared to the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  as we began our initial shipments to microsoft in the third quarter of and continued significant sales through the first quarter of however  as the product was manufactured by one of our contract manufacturers  we were able to meet microsoft s requirements without an increase in our staffing and operations 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations 
we have been unable in the past to accurately forecast our operating expenses or revenues 
revenues currently depend heavily on volatile customer purchasing patterns 
if actual revenues are less than projected revenues  we may be unable to reduce expenses proportionately  and our operating results  cash flows and liquidity would likely be adversely affected 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  and to compete effectively  we must continually introduce new products  requiring significant influx of additional capital 
many of our markets are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change resulting in short product life cycles 
development by others of new or improved products  processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 
we must devote substantial efforts and financial resources to enhance our existing products and to develop new products  including our significant investment in uwb technology 
to fund such ongoing research and development  we will require a significant influx of additional capital 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed with these efforts 
failure to effectively develop such products  notably our uwb technology  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary information 
as of december  we held six patents and four pending applications  one of which combined five previous provisional patent applications  in the united states 
certain of these patents have also been filed and issued in countries outside the united states 
we treat our technical data as confidential and rely on internal non disclosure safeguards  including confidentiality agreements with employees  and on laws protecting trade secrets  to protect our proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these measures will adequately protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information or prove valuable in light of future technological developments 
we believe our products and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights or products of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us or that such assertions will not result in costly litigation or require us to license intellectual proprietary rights from third parties 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any such licenses would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
delays in product development could adversely affect our market position or customer relationships 
we have experienced delays in product development in the past and may experience similar delays in the future 
given the short product life cycles in the markets for our products  any delay or unanticipated difficulty associated with new product introductions or product enhancements could cause us to lose customers and damage our competitive position 
prior delays have resulted from numerous factors  such as changing product specifications  the discontinuation of certain third party components  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary personnel  difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and other resource limitations  difficulties with independent contractors  changing market or competitive product requirements  unanticipated engineering complexity  undetected errors or failures in software and hardware  and delays in the acceptance or shipment of products by customers 
the development of new  technologically advanced products  including our significant investment in uwb  is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
in order to compete  we must be able to deliver products to customers that are highly reliable  operate with the customer s existing equipment  lower the customer s costs of acquisition  installation and maintenance  and provide an overall cost effective solution 
we may not be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely basis 
further  our new products may not gain market acceptance or we may not be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
our failure to respond effectively to technological changes would significantly harm our business 
finally  there can be no assurances we will be successful in these efforts 
if we are unable to respond to rapid technological change in a timely manner  then we may lose customers to our competitors 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our products 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences and frequent new product and service introductions 
if competitors introduce products and services embodying new technologies  or if new industry standards and practices emerge  then our existing proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete 
our future success will depend on our ability to do the following both license and internally develop leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing technologies  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
to develop our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may use new technologies ineffectively  or we may fail to adapt our proprietary technology and transaction processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we face material delays in introducing new services  products and enhancements  then our customers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 
we typically operate without a significant amount of backlog  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we typically operate with a small amount of backlog 
accordingly  we generally do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
any significant weakening in current customer demand would therefore have  and has had in the past  an almost immediate adverse impact on our operating results 
during much of the first half of  our common stock did not meet the minimum bid price requirement to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we were to be delisted  it could make trading in our stock more difficult 
our voting common stock is traded on the nasdaq smallcap market 
there are various quantitative listing requirements for a company to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we are required to maintain a minimum bid price of per share for our common stock 
on march   our common stock closed at 
between january  and may   focus voting common stock closed below on all trading days 
on march   we were notified by the nasdaq that our common stock did not meet the minimum bid price requirement to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
however  on may   we received notification from nasdaq that we had regained compliance and the matter was closed 
we must maintain stockholders equity of million 
at december   we had total stockholders equity of million 
to the extent we incur net losses and do not raise additional capital  our stockholders equity will be reduced 
if we fail to meet these nasdaq smallcap requirements  our common stock could be delisted  eliminating the only established trading market for our shares 
any sales of our voting common stock at a discount to market may reduce the trading price of our common stock to a level below the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement 
in the event we are delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  we would be forced to list our shares on the otc electronic bulletin board or some other quotation medium  such as pink sheets  depending on our ability to meet the specific listing requirements of those quotation systems 
as a result  an investor might find it more difficult to trade  or to obtain accurate price quotations for  such shares 
delisting might also reduce the visibility  liquidity  and price of our voting common stock 
our common stock price is volatile 
the market price for our voting common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date 
for example  between january  and december   the per share price has fluctuated between and per share  closing at on march  the trading price of our voting common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new sales formats or new products or services by us or our competitors  cyclical nature of consumer products using our technology  changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other multi media  video scan companies  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  additions or losses of significant customers  and sales of common stock or issuance of other dilutive securities 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent times  and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
these broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of stock  many companies have been the object of securities class action litigation  including us 
if we are sued in a securities class action  then it could result in additional substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and may adversely affect our business 
the european parliament has enacted the restriction on use of hazardous substances directive  or rohs directive  which restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 
we may need to redesign products containing hazardous substances regulated under the rohs directive to reduce or eliminate those regulated hazardous substances in our products 
as an example  certain of our products include lead  which is included in the list of restricted substances 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this directive on our business and have not yet estimated the potential costs of compliance 
risks related to our industry international sales are subject to significant risk 
our revenues from outside the united states are subject to inherent risks related thereto  including currency rate fluctuations  the general economic and political conditions in each country 
there can be no assurance that an economic or currency crisis experienced in certain parts of the world will not reduce demand for our products and therefore have a material adverse effect on our revenue or operating results 
our businesses are very competitive 
the computer peripheral markets are extremely competitive and are characterized by significant price erosion over the life of a product 
we currently compete with other developers of video conversion products and with video graphic integrated circuit developers 
many of our competitors have greater market recognition and greater financial  technical  marketing and human resources 
although we are not currently aware of any announcements by our competitors that would have a material impact on our operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing companies or new entrants to the marketplace 
the video production equipment market is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development and obsolescence  evolving industry standards and significant price erosion over the life of a product 
competition is fragmented with several hundred manufacturers supplying a variety of products to this market 
we anticipate increased competition in the video post production equipment market from both existing manufacturers and new market entrants 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors in this market 
often our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and customer support resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than we possess 
in addition  some of our competitors also offer a wide variety of video equipment  including professional video tape recorders  video cameras and other related equipment 
in some cases  these competitors may have a competitive advantage based upon their ability to bundle their equipment in certain large system sales 
we are exposed to general economic conditions that have resulted in significantly reduced sales levels 
if we experience adverse economic conditions our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted 
if we experience adverse economic conditions in the united states and throughout the world  we may continue to experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we have taken actions and charges to reduce our cost of sales and operating expenses in order to address adverse economic conditions 
a prolonged continuation or worsening of sales trends may require additional actions and charges to reduce cost of sales and operating expenses in subsequent quarters 
we may be unable to reduce cost of sales and operating expenses at a rate and to a level consistent with such a future adverse sales environment 
if we must undertake further expense reductions  we may incur significant incremental special charges associated with such expense reductions that are disproportionate to sales  thereby adversely affecting our business  financial condition and operating results 
adverse economic conditions could decrease demand for our products  increase delinquencies in payments and otherwise have an adverse impact on our business 
recent corporate bankruptcies  accounting irregularities  and alleged insider wrong doings have negatively affected general confidence in the stock markets and the economy  causing the united states congress to enact sweeping legislation  which will increase the costs of compliance 
in an effort to address growing investor concerns  the united states congress passed  and on july   president bush signed into law  the sarbanes oxley act of this sweeping legislation primarily impacts investors  the public accounting profession  public companies  including corporate duties and responsibilities  and securities analysts 
some highlights include establishment of a new independent oversight board for public accounting firms  enhanced disclosure and internal control requirements for public companies and their insiders  required certification by ceo s and cfo s of securities and exchange commission sec financial filings  prohibitions on certain loans to offices and directors  efforts to curb potential securities analysts conflicts of interest  forfeiture of profits by certain insiders in the event financial statements are restated  enhanced board audit committee requirements  whistleblower protections  and enhanced civil and criminal penalties for violations of securities laws 
such legislation and subsequent regulations will increase the costs of securities law compliance for publicly traded companies such as us 
we are exposed to potential risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate financial controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls 
we will be required to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act by december  if we are deemed to be an accelerated filer on june   otherwise we must meet the requirements by december  we have prepared an internal plan of action for compliance with the requirements of section  which includes a timeline and scheduled activities 
compliance with the requirements of section is expected to be expensive and time consuming 
if we fail to complete this evaluation in a timely manner  or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot timely attest to our evaluation  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
in addition  any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   we did not hold any short term investments that would be exposed to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates 
at december   our outstanding debt obligations consisted of notes payable of  and borrowings under a line of credit of  both of which are denominated in euros and were assumed in connection with the acquisition of como see note  borrowings 
the average interest rate applicable to these debt obligations is 
if short term interest rates were to increase basis points basis points equals  the increased interest expense associated with these debt obligations would not have a material impact on our net loss and cash flows 
foreign currency risk gains or losses related to foreign exchange currency transactions were not material for the years ended december   and
