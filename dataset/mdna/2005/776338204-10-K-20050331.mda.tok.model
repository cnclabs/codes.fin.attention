critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external professional advice 
estimates are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounting for sales incentives the company records sales incentives as a reduction of sales in our statements of operations 
sales incentives include rebates  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores slotting fees  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in the retailer s stores and other promotional activity 
the company records these promotional incentives in the period during which the related product is shipped to the customer  or when the expense is incurred 
estimated sales incentives are calculated and recorded at the time related sales are made and are based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
we review our assumptions and adjust our allowances quarterly 
our financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion costs fluctuate from the standard rate 
the allowances are classified as a reduction of accounts receivable 
revenue recognition net sales are recognized by ronson consumer products on the date of shipment of the product to customers  prior to which an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and it has been determined that collectibility is reasonably assured 
net sales at ronson aviation are recognized on the date of delivery of the product or service to customers 
for aircraft  this occurs at the time the title for the aircraft has been transferred and the sales proceeds received 
for aircraft fueling  repairs and other aircraft services  delivery occurs only after an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
inventory valuations inventories are valued at lower of cost or market determined by the average cost method 
management regularly reviews inventory for salability and establishes obsolescence reserves to absorb estimated lower market values 
on an annual basis  the company takes a physical inventory verifying the units on hand and comparing its perpetual records to physical counts 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
other loss accruals the company has a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  and appeal of a tax audit by the state of new jersey 
establishing accruals for these matters required management s estimate and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with the company s counsel  or other appropriate advisors  and are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
pension plans the valuation of our pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuation of expenses  assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting are reviewed annually by management and the company s independent actuary and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expenses and related funding requirements 
accounting for income taxes the company assesses the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by considering future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
new accounting pronouncement in november the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for our fiscal year beginning january   and since the company already complies with this statement  its adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on its investments  but does not consider this interest rate market risk exposure to be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company invests primarily in highly liquid debt instruments with strong credit ratings and very short term less than days maturities 
the carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value 
all of the company s short term debt  at december  carries a variable rate of interest  and  therefore  the carrying value of the short term debt approximates fair value 
the company s outstanding long term debt as of december   consisted of indebtedness in the amount of  with a variable rate of interest and  with a fixed rate of interest which is not subject to change based upon changes in prevailing market interest rates 
of the long term debt with fixed interest rates  the  mortgage loan effectively carries a fixed rate of due to an interest rate swap contract even though the loan has a variable rate 
because the interest rate swap contract is effective  the contract will result in no future gains or losses being recognized 
based on the company s average borrowings with variable interest rates during and assuming a one percentage point change in average interest rates  it is estimated that the company s interest expense during would have increased or decreased by approximately  the company is also exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to its investment in its canadian subsidiary  ronson canada and because approximately of its consolidated net sales were in canada 
as of december   the company s net investment in ronson canada was approximately  because the company s foreign currency exchange exposure is limited to one relatively stable currency and the relatively small size of its net investment in ronson canada  the company does not consider this foreign currency exchange exposure to be material to its financial condition and results of operations 
the cumulative effect of translating balance sheet accounts from the canadian dollars into the us dollars at the current exchange rate is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company  due to the nature of its operations  is also exposed to changes in the prices of fuels 
in the years ended december  and  the company s cost of fuels included in its consumer products and its cost of aircraft fuel totaled approximately  and  respectively  or approximately of cost of sales in each year 
the price of the fuels fluctuates more or less in conjunction with oil prices 
an increase or decrease of in the average cost of the company s fuels would have increased or decreased the company s cost of sales by approximately  in costs of fuel also impacts the cost of various other components used in the company s products 
increases in the price of fuels  to the extent the company is not able to increase the prices of its products to its customers  could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
under its current policies  except for an interest rate swap contract noted above  the company does not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices 
other risk factors political and economic risks the company s operations are exposed to the risk of political and economic uncertainties 
changes in political and economic conditions may affect product cost  availability  distribution  pricing  purchasing  and consumption patterns 
while the company seeks to manage its business in consideration of these risks  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
operating results and net earnings may not meet expectations the company cannot be sure that its operating results and net earnings will meet its expectations 
if the company s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition  or if the company does not achieve all of its key goals  then the company s actual performance could vary materially from its expectations 
the company s operating results and net earnings may be influenced by a number of factors  including the following the introduction of new products and line extensions by the company or its competitors  the company s ability to control its internal costs and the cost of raw materials  the effectiveness of the company s advertising  marketing and promotional programs  the changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  the ability of the company to achieve business plans  including volume and pricing plans  as a result of high levels of competitive activity  the ability to maintain key customer relationships  the ability of major customers and other creditors to meet their obligations as they come due  the ability to successfully manage regulatory  tax and legal matters  including resolution of pending matters within current estimates  the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified personnel  the costs  distraction of management  and disruption that may be incurred due to the actions of a dissident shareholder hedge fund 
regulatory risks the company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on its business operations  including among other things  the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the handling  use  treatment  storage and clean up of solid and hazardous wastes  and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances 
such laws and regulations may otherwise relate to various health and safety matters that impose burdens upon the company s operations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects and also require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations also impose strict and joint and several liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up current sites  past spills  disposal and other releases of hazardous substances 
the company believes that its expenditures related to environmental matters are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the environmental laws under which the company operates are complicated and often increasingly more stringent  and may be applied retroactively 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to make additional expenditures to remain in or to achieve compliance with environmental laws in the future or that any such additional expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
certain of the company s products have chemical compositions that are controlled by various state  federal and international laws and regulations 
the company complies with these laws and regulations and seeks to anticipate developments that could impact the company s products 
these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
volatility in the insurance market the company evaluates its insurance coverage annually 
trends in the insurance industry suggest that such coverage may be much more expensive  less protective or even unavailable which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in such a case  the company may decide to self insure more  thereby undertaking additional risks 
ronson consumer products component supply risk ronson consumer products depends upon its vendors for the supply of the primary components for its flame accessory and chemical products 
certain of these components are subject to significant price volatility beyond the control or influence of the company 
petroleum products have had significant price volatility in the past and may in the future 
rising oil prices can also impact the company s cost of transporting its products 
the company has historically been successful in managing its component costs and product pricing to maintain historical gross margins 
additionally  the company has generally found alternative sources of constituent chemicals for its products readily available 
as component and raw material costs are the main contribution to cost of goods sold for all of the company s products  any significant fluctuation in the costs of components could also have a material impact on the gross margins realized on the company s products 
increases in the prices for the components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
reliance on supply chain each of ronson consumer products lighter and torch products is manufactured by a single vendor 
since there are a number of sources of similar lighter products  the company believes that other suppliers could provide lighters and torches on comparable terms 
the loss of any of these suppliers or manufacturers could  however  temporarily disrupt or interrupt the production of the company s products 
competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive and is expected to continue to be competitive in the future 
the company s products compete both within their own product classes as well as within product distribution channels  competing with many other products for store placement and shelf space 
the company is aware of many competing products  some of which sell for lower prices  however  the company relies on the awareness of its brands among consumers  the value offered by those brands as perceived by consumers  and competitive pricing as its primary competitive strategies 
these considerations as well as increased competition generally could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and a loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
competitive pressures faced by the company could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
business risks with the trend toward consolidation in the retail marketplace  the company s customer base is shifting toward fewer  but larger  customers who purchase in larger volumes 
the loss of  or reduction in  orders from any of the company s most significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its financial results 
large customers also seek price reductions and promotional concessions 
in this regard  the company has expanded its customer promotions and allowances which has negatively impacted  and will likely continue to impact  the company s maintenance of existing profit margins 
in addition  the company is subject to changes in customer purchasing patterns 
these types of changes may result from changes in the manner in which customers purchase and manage inventory levels  or display and promote products within their stores 
other potential factors such as customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters may also impact operating results 
the manufacture  packaging  storage  distribution and labeling of the company s products and the company s business operations all must comply with extensive federal and state laws and regulations 
it is possible that the government will increase regulation of the transportation  storage or use of certain chemicals  to enhance homeland security or protect the environment and that such regulation could negatively impact raw material supply or costs 
some of the company s consumer products are associated in part with tobacco 
these products are also utilized for other purposes such as replacing the match 
the company s research and development department is continuing to develop products utilizing the company s fuels with products not associated with tobacco 
the potential decline in smoking  however  may have a negative impact on the company 
protection of intellectual property the company relies on trademark  trade secret  patent and copyright laws to protect its most important asset  the ronson brand name  and its other intellectual property 
the company cannot be certain that the intellectual property rights will be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated or circumvented 
ronson aviation supply risk ronson aviation depends upon its vendors for the supply of its principal products 
aircraft fuels are subject to significant price volatility 
ronson aviation has historically been successful in the pricing of its fuel to maintain its gross margins 
increases in the price of the aircraft fuels could have an adverse effect on the demand for ronson aviation products and aviation services  and on its operating results  financial position and cash flows 
ronson aviation relies on raytheon aircraft corporation as its sole supplier of new piston engine s aircraft for sale 
loss of availability of such aircraft and delays in deliveries of aircraft have had from time to time  and may in the future temporarily have  an adverse effect on ronson aviation s net sales 
business risk ronson aviation depends upon demand for general aviation services  including corporate air travel and private charter 
increased security requirements and concerns may have an effect  positive or adverse  on ronson aviation s future operating results  financial position and cash flows
