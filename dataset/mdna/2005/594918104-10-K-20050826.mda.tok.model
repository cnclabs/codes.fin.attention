item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies of this report 
we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks 
we operate in over countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales 
pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries 
operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws  policies and measures  and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software  social  political  labor  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 
while we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure  significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our future net revenues 
general economic and geo political risks may affect our revenue and profitability 
softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue 
abrupt political change  terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries or generally and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements  thus increasing our operating costs 
these conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers 
catastrophic events may disrupt our business 
we are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems in the event of a major earthquake  cyber attack  terrorist attack  or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales and providing services 
our corporate headquarters  a significant portion of our research and development activities  and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle  washington area  and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california  both of which are near major page 
table of contents part i item earthquake faults 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business 
we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our long term business strategy 
these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy  that we don t realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make  or that we may experience difficulty in the integration of new employees  business systems and technology  or diversion of management s attention from our other businesses 
these factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
we have limited insurance 
we maintain third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss 
because of the unavailability or high cost of conventional insurance arrangements  we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets 
as of june   the face value of captive insurance arrangements was billion 
actual value at any particular time will vary due to deductibles  exclusions  other restrictions  and claims 
while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks  the potential liabilities associated with the risks discussed in this report or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements 
other risks that may affect our business 
other factors that may affect our performance may include sales channel disruption  such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor  our ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth  and the continued availability of third party distribution channels for msn service and other online services

md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements notes 
we develop  manufacture  license  and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices 
our software products include operating systems for servers  pcs  and intelligent devices  server applications for distributed computing environments  information worker productivity applications  business solutions applications  and software development tools 
we provide consulting and product support services  and we train and certify system integrators and developers 
we sell the xbox video game console and games  pc games  and pc peripherals 
online communication and information services are delivered through our msn portals and channels around the world 
our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers 
our home and entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season 
historically  approximately to of home and entertainment revenue has been generated in the second fiscal quarter 
we believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future 
we intend to sustain the long term growth of our businesses through technological innovation  engineering excellence  and a commitment to delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners 
recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide pc adoption and software upgrades  we continue to advance the functionality  security  and value of windows operating systems  including versions for new devices such as tablet pcs  media center pcs  portable media centers  and mobile devices such as smartphones 
we are also increasing our focus on emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software in those markets 
in addition  we develop innovative software applications and solutions to enhance the productivity of information workers  improve communication and collaboration in work groups  aid business intelligence  and streamline processes for small and mid sized businesses 
to sustain the growth of our server and tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software  our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing the most advanced  easiest to deploy and manage and most secure with the lowest total cost of ownership 
to take advantage of new market opportunities  we continue to invest in research and development of existing and new lines of business  such as services for consumers  businesses and large enterprises that we believe can contribute significantly to our long term growth 
we also research and develop advanced technologies for future software products 
delivering breakthrough innovation and high value solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth 
we believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for long term growth by delivering innovative new products  creating opportunity for partners  improving customer satisfaction with key audiences  putting some of our most significant legal cases behind us  and improving our internal business processes 
our focus in fiscal year is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas  including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform  delivering compelling value propositions to customers  responding effectively to customer and partner needs  and continuing to focus internally on product excellence  business efficacy  and accountability across the company 
key market opportunities include growth in our anchor businesses through forthcoming innovations and new product launches and making inroads against software piracy 
expanding our innovation portfolio by offering extensions of our technologies targeted towards specific customer needs either as new products or as higher value versions of existing products 
delivering software services through online consumer services and services for businesses that enable workers to collaborate interactively 
page 
table of contents part ii item worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software  services  games and internet service offerings 
we expect that general macroeconomic trends will remain stable or experience slight improvement in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our optimism is balanced by recent data which revealed slight downward revisions when compared to previous forecasts for gross domestic product growth in the us  united kingdom  france  germany  japan and latin america 
the leading indicators were also revised slightly lower for the major markets 
additionally  recent surveys of chief information officers also reflect slight downward revisions in expected corporate it spend budgets and short term purchase intent 
as open source software development and distribution evolves  we continue to seek to differentiate our products from competitive products based on open source software 
we believe that microsoft s share of server unit operating systems held steady in fiscal year  while linux distributions rose slightly faster on an absolute basis 
summary in millions  except percentages percent change percent change revenue operating income our revenue growth for fiscal year was driven by growth in licensing of windows server operating systems and other server applications  licensing of windows client operating systems through oems  and increased licensing of office and other information worker products 
the license revenue growth resulted from growth in server hardware and pc shipments  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and overall improvements in it spending 
the november launch of the halo xbox game also contributed to the overall revenue growth for the company 
based on our preliminary estimates  worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew about to and total server hardware shipments grew approximately to during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in  primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies  particularly the euro and japanese yen  against the us dollar 
had the exchange rates from the previous year been in effect in fiscal year  translated international revenue growth earned in local currencies would have been approximately million or two percentage points lower for fiscal year we hedge a portion of our international currency exposures  thereby reducing our overall exposure 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a greater impact on non oem commercial and retail license business as a significant portion of those product revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
the vast majority of oem license revenue is denominated in us dollars 
partially offsetting revenue growth rates was a billion decline in earned revenue from upgrade advantage in fiscal year the upgrade advantage contract value reached its expiration dates in the first quarter of fiscal year this revenue was recognized over fiscal year and fiscal year and in the first quarter of fiscal year when the contract period expired 
revenue growth in fiscal year was primarily driven by the growth in licensing of windows client operating systems through oems  windows server operating systems  office and other server applications as a result of growth in pc and server hardware shipments 
the worldwide pc shipment growth rate from all sources was estimated at and the windows server shipment was estimated at in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal year due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the us dollar 
this resulted in approximately billion growth in total revenue 
revenue growth in fiscal year was driven primarily by multi year licensing that occurred before the licensing transition date in the first quarter of fiscal year the fiscal year revenue growth also reflected a million or increase associated with oem licensing of windows operating systems and a million or increase in revenue from xbox video game consoles 
for fiscal year  the operating income increase was driven by a decline in stock based compensation expense  increased revenue in server and tools  client and information worker  which have higher gross margins as compared to other segments  and a reduction in legal costs associated with major litigation 
in addition  strong sales of halo reduced the overall operating loss for the home and entertainment segment for fiscal year the billion decrease in stock based compensation expense was partially offset by increased operating expenses of million related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount 
general and administrative expenses related to major litigation declined in fiscal year due to the billion of charges related to the page 
table of contents part ii item settlement of sun microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the european commission in fiscal year this effect was partially offset by legal expenses of billion related to settlements with ibm  novell  gateway  and end user class action plaintiffs to resolve antitrust issues and other matters 
in fiscal year  the operating income decline was caused primarily by billion of legal charges and billion of stock based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program  mainly offset by an increase in revenue 
in fiscal year  the growth in operating income reflected an increase in revenue  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses related to employee and related costs associated with headcount and increased legal settlement expenses  primarily the time warner settlement charge of million 
in fiscal year  we implemented changes in employee compensation whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options 
we also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of or higher to jpmorgan 
the unvested options that were transferred to jpmorgan became vested upon the transfer 
a total of million of the million eligible options were transferred  which resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of billion in the second quarter of fiscal year as a result of these changes  we expect stock based compensation expense to continue to decrease for at least the next three fiscal years 
the following table shows total stock based compensation expense by segment and by income statement classification for fiscal years  and in millions increase decrease increase decrease client server and tools information worker microsoft business solutions msn mobile and embedded devices home and entertainment corporate consolidated cost of revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative consolidated in fiscal year  we expect revenue to grow at a higher rate than fiscal year  mainly due to the launches of new products 
we expect higher revenue growth in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in home and entertainment primarily driven by the launch of xbox we estimate worldwide pc shipments will grow between to and worldwide server unit shipments will grow between to in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we do not expect a benefit from year over year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year we expect our operating income growth rate in fiscal year to exceed our revenue growth rate 
operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to lower costs for legal settlements than incurred in fiscal year and a reduction in stock based compensation expense 
the operating loss for home and entertainment is expected to increase in fiscal year driven by the launch of and investments in xbox segment product revenue operating income loss our seven segments are client  server and tools  information worker  microsoft business solutions  msn  mobile and embedded devices  and home and entertainment 
the revenue and operating income loss amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the page 
table of contents part ii item segments 
the segment information appearing in note segment information of the notes to financial statements is presented on a basis consistent with the company s internal management reporting  in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately 
fiscal years and amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation including reclassifying certain legal settlements from business segments to corporate level expense 
client in millions  except percentages percent change percent change revenue operating income client includes revenue from windows xp professional and home  media center edition  tablet pc edition  and other standard windows operating systems 
client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of corporate and consumer purchases of pcs from oems that pre install versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for over of total client revenue 
the operating results for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the reorganization of the windows security group from server and tools to client 
client revenue increased in fiscal year driven by growth in oem license units and million or growth in oem revenue from increased pc unit shipments  partially offset by a million or decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems 
this channel mix shift reflects our customers continued preference for upgrading their pc operating systems through the oem channel when they replace their pcs versus the purchase of a multi year licensing agreement 
the mix of oem windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total oem windows operating systems licensed during the year remained flat at of total oem windows operating systems as compared to the previous year 
revenue earned from upgrade advantage declined by million in fiscal year contributing to the decrease in commercial and retail licensing revenue 
the differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the year  changes in the geographical mix  the channel mix of products sold by large  multi national oems versus those sold by local and regional system builders  and previous changes to deferral rates and product lives for undelivered elements of unearned revenue 
client revenue increase in fiscal year was driven by growth in oem licenses and growth in oem revenue on increased consumer pc unit shipments in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in business pc unit shipments in the second half of fiscal year client operating income increased in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in oem revenue and a decrease in stock based compensation expense 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with start something  a globally launched advertising campaign  marketing for security initiatives  and an increase in salary and benefits for new and existing headcount 
the additional headcount for research and development was primarily devoted to the continued development of the windows client next generation operating system 
the operating income for fiscal year has been restated for a reclassification of legal settlement charges totaling million from client to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation 
client operating income increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year mainly due to growth in revenue  partially offset by increased operating expenses primarily related to stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year we anticipate that worldwide pc shipments will grow at approximately to in fiscal year  continuing to influence our growth in client revenue 
in addition  we estimate that increasing shipments of laptops as a percentage of total pc systems will continue to positively influence client revenue growth due to shorter replacement cycles for laptops 
the time between operating system releases may affect our ability to close some multi year licensing agreements 
we expect growth rates in emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates 
piracy continues to be a challenge in both emerging and mature markets 
we intend to focus on growing oem licenses faster than the overall market by reducing piracy  particularly in the mature markets  through initiatives such as windows genuine advantage 
client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall client revenue growth  but we expect to see improvements in these channels in fiscal year compared to fiscal year we anticipate a modest increase in our premium product mix in fiscal year  although we page 
table of contents part ii item anticipate shipments of the premium priced media center edition will grow as a percentage of the total operating system shipments 
major investments in fiscal year will focus on development of windows vista  the next generation pc operating system  and will include marketing initiatives such as the global start something campaign 
server and tools in millions  except percentages percent change percent change revenue operating income server and tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses cals for windows server  microsoft sql server  exchange server  and other server products 
it also includes developer tools  training  certification  microsoft press  premier and professional product support services  and microsoft consulting services 
server and tools concentrates on licensing products  applications  tools  content  and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient 
the segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre installed oem versions  licenses through partners  and licenses directly to end customers 
the licenses are sold both as one time licenses and as multi year volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customers 
server and tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products 
server and tools growth is driven by performance of the overall market for information technology both hardware and software 
the operating results for previous years have been restated for the reorganization of the windows security group from server and tools to client and the reorganization of professional product support services from information worker to server and tools 
server and tools revenue growth in fiscal year was mainly driven by growth in server and server application revenue  including cal revenue  which grew billion or in fiscal year reflecting broad adoption of windows server system products  including windows server  sql server  exchange server  and management servers 
we estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew to during fiscal year and that windows based server shipments grew at a comparable rate for the same period 
consulting and premier and professional product support services revenue increased million or compared to the previous year  primarily due to increased consultant utilization and new premier customers 
foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately million or three percentage points of total server and tools revenue growth  which was offset by a million decline in upgrade advantage revenue earned 
in fiscal year  server and server applications revenue  including cal revenue  grew billion or 
foreign currency exchange rates contributed approximately million or five percentage points of server and tools revenue growth in fiscal year compared to fiscal year consulting and premier product support services revenue increased million or compared to fiscal year due to increased customer penetration from new product offerings 
server and tools operating income growth for fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in revenue and a decrease in stock based compensation expense 
this was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcount related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits 
operating income for the previous year has been restated for a reclassification of billion of legal settlements from server and tools to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation 
server and tools operating income for fiscal year increased slightly due to the revenue increase offset by increased stock based compensation charges  including million related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year we expect worldwide server hardware shipments to grow to in fiscal year however  we face strong competition from linux based  unix  and other server operating systems 
we anticipate little or no year over year foreign currency exchange rate impacts in fiscal year we also expect server and tools operating expenses to increase during fiscal year due to expected investment in headcount and new marketing initiatives and upcoming product releases  including sql server and visual studio page 
table of contents part ii item information worker in millions  except percentages percent change percent change revenue operating income information worker consists of the microsoft office system of programs  servers  services  and solutions designed to increase personal  team  and organization productivity 
information worker includes microsoft office  microsoft project  microsoft visio  sharepoint portal server cals  and other information worker products including microsoft livemeeting and onenote 
most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our office system products 
revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle management  collaboration  and business intelligence 
beginning in fiscal year  the small and mid market solutions partners sms p organization  which was historically part of information worker  was re aligned in microsoft business solutions 
as a result of this change  information worker results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of the sms p organization to microsoft business solutions 
the results for previous periods have also been restated due to the reclassification of professional product support services from information worker into server and tools 
information worker revenue increased in fiscal year primarily due to a or million increase in volume licensing  retail packaged product  and pre installed versions of office in japan  a or million increase in oem revenue  and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by reduced upgrade advantage earned revenue 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately million or three percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year  offset by a million decline in upgrade advantage earned revenue 
revenue growth for fiscal year from volume licensing  retail packaged product and pre installed versions of office in japan was in aggregate 
this increase was driven by recognition of unearned revenue primarily from a large increase in multi year licenses signed previous to the transition to our licensing programs and approximately million related to the launch of office oem licensing revenue grew or million 
foreign currency exchange rates provided approximately million or of total information worker revenue growth 
information worker operating income growth for fiscal year was primarily due to the revenue growth and a decrease in stock based compensation expense 
operating expenses were also impacted by a reduction in marketing campaign costs from the previous period associated with the launch of office this decline was offset by an increase in headcount related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits 
information worker operating income in fiscal year increased from the previous year primarily due to growth in revenue  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses  primarily related to million of stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year and higher sales and marketing expenses 
the revenue growth rate for information worker is expected to be higher in fiscal year than fiscal year we expect sustained momentum in our oem and multi year licensing offerings and increased purchasing of office system as enterprises complete their product evaluations 
we expect to see slowing revenue from packaged product late in the year as we approach the next version launch

sms p supports small and mid market customers for microsoft including microsoft business solutions 
results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of sms p for all periods presented 
also as a result of the reorganization  the microsoft partner program became a component of microsoft business solutions 
the increase in microsoft business solutions revenue in fiscal year was mainly due to a revenue growth in software partially offset by a decline in services revenue  which resulted from encouraging our partners to provide more of these types of services 
the software revenue increase was driven by a growth in license revenue and growth in enhancement revenue as compared to the previous year  and is attributed to growth in our line of business solutions and customer relationship management solutions  and increased microsoft partner program subscriptions 
the revenue increase in fiscal year was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of navision and axapta line of business solutions  new sales of microsoft crm  and microsoft partner program subscriptions 
microsoft business solutions operating loss declined in fiscal year primarily due to a decline in stock based compensation expense  an increase in product revenue  and a decline in acquisition intangibles amortization 
the reduction in operating loss was partially offset by a net increase in sales and marketing expense driven by incremental headcount and marketing costs in the sms p organization 
in addition  there has been an increase in marketing and product development investments in our portfolio of business solutions 
the operating loss for fiscal year increased from fiscal year due to an increase in stock based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year  partially offset by an increase in revenue and lower operating expenses including million of lower intangibles amortization costs

revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on msn  from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services  and from subscribers to msn narrowband internet access 
in fiscal year  we launched a new version of our msn search engine  which is based on our own technology 
this change will help provide the ability to innovate more quickly and the opportunity to develop a long term competitive advantage in search 
in addition to the launch of msn search  we introduced many new products and product enhancements in fiscal year  including a new version of the msn home page which provides a richer user experience  quicker load times  higher levels of end user customization  and fewer advertisements and links 
msn launched the clarity in advertising program in fiscal year  which removed paid advertising from inclusion in search results and resulted in a reduced number of advertisements that are returned with search results

table of contents part ii item advertising program and the impact of the home page redesign 
revenue from subscription and transaction services other than internet access increased million or in fiscal year as a result of growth in the number of msn premium subscribers through our carrier partnerships 
offsetting the overall revenue growth was a decline of million or in internet access revenue  driven by the continued migration of internet access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced internet service providers 
at the end of the current fiscal year  msn had million internet access subscribers and million total subscribers compared to million and million at the end of the previous year 
in addition  msn has over million unique users monthly  over million active hotmail accounts  and over million active messenger accounts 
in fiscal year  msn advertising revenue increased million or as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall internet advertising market 
this increase was partially offset by a decline of million or in internet access revenue 
revenue from subscription and transaction services other than internet access increased million 
in fiscal year  msn operating income increased mainly due to a decrease in stock based compensation expense  reduced online operations and bandwidth costs associated with the internet access business as the number of subscribers declines  and increased advertising and subscription revenue 
the operating income increase was partially offset by an increase in headcount related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits  and a million tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year msn reached profitability in the first quarter of fiscal year and was profitable for fiscal year the improvement in profitability in fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in revenue  a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the internet access business  efficiency gains in the operations of the advertising and subscription businesses  and a million refund of previous year taxes  partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation expense 
msn expects increased growth in advertising revenue as it benefits from improvements to its advertising platform and search engine and continued increases in internet spending 
we expect revenue from narrowband internet access to continue to decline in fiscal year profitability may decline in fiscal year as investments are made in the development of new applications and services  the search and search monetization platform  and growth in the field sales force 
msn may from time to time continue to make investments in improving the user experience and in some cases  the number of advertisements delivered either via our search tools or via our internet portals may be reduced to improve the overall user experience thereby helping to sustain and grow our user base

we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions

net losses on equity investees and other for the previous periods were reclassified into investment income and other to conform to the current period presentation 
income taxes our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year was compared with for fiscal year the decreased rate for the full year resulted primarily from the reversal of million of previously accrued taxes upon settling an internal revenue service examination for fiscal years to and recording a tax benefit of million generated by the decision to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings under a temporary incentive provided by the american jobs creation act of the effective tax rate for fiscal year was

as of june   the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately million 
we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists 
we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources 
in fiscal year  our board of directors approved per share cash dividends  with paid as of june  a quarterly dividend of per share or approximately million was approved by our board of directors on june  to be paid to shareholders of record as of august  on september  on july   our board of directors approved a plan to buy back up to billion in microsoft common stock over four years 
the specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions  securities law limitations  and other factors 
the repurchases will be made using our cash resources 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without previous notice 
in any period  cash used in financing activities related to common stock repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders equity  reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash 
during fiscal year  we repurchased million shares  or billion of our common stock under this plan 
we believe existing cash and short term investments  together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements  quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases

application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  impairment of goodwill  accounting for research and development costs  accounting for legal contingencies  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time 
these elements include free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when and if available basis  the fair value of which is recognized over the product s estimated life cycle 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the page 
table of contents part ii item ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sec sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments

 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis july for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and accordingly  we expense all research and development costs when incurred 
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

table of contents part ii item  a we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  fixed income  equity and commodity price risks 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  primarily with option contracts 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk 
the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk 
securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk  and are generally not hedged 
however  we use options to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes 
we use a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model used for currencies and equities is geometric brownian motion  which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures 
for interest rate risk  the mean reverting geometric brownian motion is used to reflect the principle that fixed income securities prices revert to maturity value over time 
var is calculated by  first  simulating  market price paths over a specified period of time for equities  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices 
each resulting unique set of equities prices  interest rates  and foreign exchange rates is then applied to substantially all individual holdings to re price each holding 
the th worst performance out of  represents the var over a specified period of time at the percentile confidence level 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  credit risk  and legal risk 
certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes 
we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put call collars 
in these arrangements  we hedge a security s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security s appreciation above the sold call strike  in exchange for the premium received for the sold call 
we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes 
we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods 
the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio 
losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the var analysis 
var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses  including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 
the var numbers are shown separately for interest rate  currency  equity and commodity risks 
these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges 
we use historical data to estimate var 
given the reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk

table of contents part ii item a management began using a day var for internal risk measurement purposes effective for the quarter ended march  the effect of changing from day var to day var was not material and there have been no modifications to the assumptions or parameters within the model 
the following table sets forth the day var for substantially all of our positions 
in millions year ended june  risk categories average high low interest rates currency rates equity prices commodity prices the total day var for the combined risk categories was million at june  and million at june  the total var is less at june  and less at june  than the sum of the separate risk categories for each of those years in the above table  due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks
