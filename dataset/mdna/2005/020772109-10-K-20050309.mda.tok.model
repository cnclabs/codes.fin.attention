item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our selected five year financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this report 
cautionary statement for forward looking information certain information set forth in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
forward looking statements include statements concerning our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events  future revenues or performance  capital expenditures  financing needs  plans or intentions relating to potential acquisitions and other information that is not historical information 
when used in this report  the words estimates  expects  anticipates  forecasts  plans  intends  believes and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we may make additional forward looking statements from time to time 
all subsequent forward looking statements  whether written or oral and whether made by us or on our behalf  are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the application of these accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide timely and reliable financial information 
we believe our critical accounting polices include the following inventories inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates average cost or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future sales and supply on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition for sales transactions  we comply with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are satisfied upon shipment of product and revenues are recognized accordingly 
sales are reduced for any anticipated sales returns  rebates and allowances based on historical experience 
since our return policy is only days and our products are not generally susceptible to external factors such as technological obsolescence or significant changes in demand  we are able to make a reasonable estimate for returns 
we offer end user product specific and sales volume rebates to select distributors 
our rebates are based on actual sales and accrued for monthly 
stock based compensation we account for stock options granted to employees and directors under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
instead of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
under apb opinion no 
 no stock based employee compensation is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the company s plan have an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock on the date of the grant 
the effect on net income if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
would have been a decrease of  for fiscal the fair values of stock option grants are determined using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions expected stock price volatility based on historic and management s expectations of future volatility  risk free interest rates from published sources  weighted average expected option lives based on historical data and no dividend yield  as management currently does not intend to pay dividends in the near future 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect their fair value 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for employee services and generally establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains goods or services in share based payment transactions 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r effective july  using the modified prospective application with no restatement of prior interim periods 
the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
during the second half of  we expect to record compensation expense of approximately  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r  based on existing unvested options as of december  for additional information on our accounting policies  see footnote of the accompanying financial statements 
overview alpha pro tech is in the business of protecting people  products and environments

our products as classified above are grouped into four business segments 
the disposable protective apparel segment  consisting of disposable protective apparel  the infection control segment  consisting of face masks and eye shields  the extended care segment  consisting of extended care products  namely medical bed pads and pet beds  and the engineered products segment  consisting of construction weatherization products such as building wrap and synthetic roof underlayment as well as a line of antimicrobial paint 
our target markets are pharmaceutical manufacturing  bio pharmaceutical manufacturing and medical device manufacturing  lab animal research  high technology electronics manufacturing which includes the semi conductor market  medical and dental distributors  pet stores and pet distributors and construction supply and roofing distributors 
our products are used primarily in cleanrooms  industrial safety manufacturing environments  health care facilities such as hospitals  laboratories and dental offices  as well as construction supply sites 
our pet beds are used by pet owners and veterinarians 
our products are distributed principally in the united states through a network consisting of purchasing groups  national distributors  local distributors  independent sales representatives and our own sales and marketing force 
during  we announced the formation of a new business segment  alpha protech engineered products  inc engineered products  a wholly owned subsidiary of alpha pro tech 
this new segment will consist of a line of construction supply weatherization products as well as a line of paint with antimicrobials 
the construction supply weatherization products will consist of building wrap and a synthetic roof underlayment 
the line of paint with antimicrobials is designed to inhibit growth of bacteria  fungi and algae on the painted surfaces in hospitals  surgical rooms and cleanrooms and associated controlled environments 
our paint has been tested at nelson laboratories  inc  a privately owned testing lab specializing in microbiology  and confirmed by a leading university for its containment ability to inhibit micro organisms 
we have an exclusive licensing agreement for the proprietary antimicrobial formulation to be used in the paint 
in addition to our paint with antimicrobials  we are currently developing a line of sealants with antimicrobials to be used for mold remediation 
the engineered products segment is expected to contribute significantly to revenue growth starting in we are also focused on appreciably improving sales in the pharmaceutical  cleanroom and industrial safety markets 
our key sales growth strategies for these markets are based on a strategy of communicating directly with end users and developing innovative products to suit individual end users true needs 
our apparel segment that services these markets grew by in and we expect sales growth to improve in the coming quarters 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations income before provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales 
consolidated sales for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or 
approximately million of the sales in were a direct result of the sars outbreak 
excluding the million non core sars related n mask and eye shield sales in  our core business grew by  to  in from  in we attribute this core business increase primarily to sales to the pharmaceutical industry  cleanroom industry and to the industrial safety industry 
mask and eye shield sales for the year ended december  decreased by  or to  from  in the same period of the decrease is primarily the result of approximately  in n mask and eye shield sales in related to sars 
excluding the sars sales  mask and eye shield sales decreased by approximately  or for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of this decrease is primarily attributable to decreased mask sales to the medical and dental markets and is also linked to the sars outbreak of during the sars outbreak of  we experienced growth in masks other than the n respirator  but did not attribute them directly to sars as only the n respirator mask was recommended by the center for disease control cdc 
in  we assumed that the non n respirator mask sales were attributable to heightened awareness as a result of the sars scare  and expected that medical and dental professionals would continue with a higher level of protection controls 
in  once the sars scare subsided  medical and dental professionals went back to the pre sars level of protection 
sales for the apparel division for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period of the apparel division sales increase of  or was primarily due to increased sales to distributors that concentrate on the industrial safety industry  as well as increased sales of to our largest distributor

in the second quarter of alone  which was at the height of sars outbreak  we had million of n mask sales 
normally we would sell only  per quarter 
sales continued to be stronger than normal into july and then returned to normal levels as the sars crisis subsided 
most of these n respirator mask sales ultimately went to either asia or toronto  the areas most widely hit by sars 
in addition to the n respirator  the cdc also recommended using eye protection to prevent the transmission of sars

these are core products which we expect to be consumed during the regular course of business 
the decrease in finished goods is primarily attributable to a decrease in apparel finished goods and to a lesser extent n respirator masks 
in june  we closed our apparel manufacturing facility located in mexico and significantly increased the manufacturing of these goods by a third party sub contractor in china 
with the majority of apparel finished goods coming from china  our lead time increased and consequently the inventory levels increased 
in  after review of our inventory forecasting model  we decided to reduce the required inventory levels on hand

in august  we announced that our board of directors had approved the buy back of up to an additional  of the company s outstanding common stock 
this new share repurchase program is the sixth  buyback authorized by the board of directors

new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for employee services and generally establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains goods or services in share based payment transactions 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r effective july  using the modified prospective application with no restatement of prior interim periods 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
during the second half of  we expect to record compensation expense of approximately  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r  based on existing unvested options as of december  in january  the fasb  issued fasb interpretation number  fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin fin addresses consolidation of variable interest entities  which are entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  and for variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  finr  to clarify certain provisions and exempt certain entities from its requirements 
since we do not have any variable interest entities  the adoption of fin and fin r did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we subcontract the manufacture of products in china and to a lesser extent in mexico 
in addition the company s executive office  which employees people  is located in canada 
our results of operations could be negatively affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to stronger economic conditions in those countries 
we believe we do not have a material foreign currency exposure due to the fact that our purchase agreements with our third party subcontractors in both china and mexico are in us dollars 
in canada our foreign currency exposure is not material due to the fact that we do not manufacture in canada 
we do not expect any significant effect on our results of operations from inflation or interest and currency rate fluctuations 
we do not hedge our interest rate or foreign exchange risks
