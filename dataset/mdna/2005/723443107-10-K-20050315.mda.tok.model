item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations review of we provide northwest with regional airline capacity as a northwest airlink carrier at its domestic hub airports in detroit  minneapolis st 
paul and memphis 
we continue to be the only operator of seat and seat crjs as a code share partner of northwest 
as of december   we operated a jet fleet of crj aircraft and offered regional airline services with approximately daily departures to cities in states and four canadian provinces 
for the year ended december   we reported annual net income of million  or a share 
net income increased million  or  over net income of million  or a share 
annual operating revenue in reached million  up from the prior year  yielding operating income of million  up from the prior year 
in  our block hours and cycles increased by and  respectively  over we operate in one business segment consisting of regional airline services 
we operate for northwest according to the terms of the asa  which we entered into effective march  our revenue from regional airline services consists of i reimbursement payments for certain operating expenses incurred in providing regional airline capacity to northwest and ii payments based on pre set rates for fixed costs  completed block hours and completed cycles 
we also receive margin payments on these items intended to achieve a target operating margin 
a more detailed discussion of our asa can be found in this form k under item business our airline services agreement with northwest 
we believe our operations are integral to northwest s future growth and complement northwest s operations by allowing more frequent service to selected markets than could be provided economically with conventional large jet aircraft 
our regional jets operational capabilities allow us to service markets profitably that do not have enough passenger traffic to support northwest s mainline jet service 
northwest has indicated its commitment to regional jets as part of its core strategy by placing firm orders on crjs  all of which have been committed to us and of which have been delivered as of march   and acquiring options on an additional crjs 
the following is a list of certain significant developments in our business during successful completion of expansion plans the addition of crjs to our fleet during  representing an increase of  required us to hire and train a significant number of new employees  specifically pilots and flight attendants 
our corporate education center has been and will be instrumental in training and developing our people to allow for such growth 
in addition  we successfully opened seven new stations as part of northwest s network 
increase in committed aircraft in december  we amended our asa with northwest to increase from to the number of crjs that will be operated by pinnacle airlines  inc increased employee productivity for the year ended december   we decreased our labor costs per block hour by approximately compared to our headcount per aircraft decreased from at december  to at december  our pilot utilization increased from hours per month for the year ended december  to hours per month for the year ended december  as of december   of our flight attendants were part time versus as of december  decrease in unit costs for the year ended december   we decreased our operating costs per block hour and asm by approximately and over  respectively 
outlook for our rapid growth is scheduled to continue in with the addition of aircraft  representing an increase of over the size of our fleet as of december  of the planned deliveries of crj aircraft in  we are planning to accept delivery of six aircraft in the first quarter three received as of march   thirteen aircraft in the second quarter and three aircraft in the third quarter 
we believe that operating a fleet of all regional jet aircraft with strong operational performance and cost efficiency  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook for continued particularly high employee utilization  is crucial to our growth 
we believe this will position us well to compete for the additional crj aircraft that northwest has on option  which have not yet been exercised or committed to any regional airline 
as another element of our growth strategy  we intend to seek opportunities to provide regional airline service to other major carriers 
subject to certain restrictions  our asa allows us to establish separate operations to provide airline services to other major carriers 
although we are not in current discussions with any other carriers  we intend to actively pursue opportunities with other major airlines that are interested in entering into a business relationship with a high quality  cost efficient regional airline partner 
we are currently building the foundation for our second air carrier certificate  and expect to have the groundwork completed by the end of we believe opportunities exist to provide regional airline services to other carriers using equipment types with capacities ranging from to seats 
we are currently restricted by the terms of our asa from operating aircraft with more than seats  even through the use of a separate operating subsidiary and separate air carrier certificate 
we have requested that northwest review this scope limitation 
in early  we issued million of our senior convertible notes due the notes 
we used the proceeds to repurchase our million note payable to northwest at a discounted purchase price of million  and to repay the then current outstanding balance of million under our revolving credit agreement with northwest revolver 
in addition  we shortened the term of the revolver from december  to june  the northwest note contained a provision that required us to make principal prepayments when our month end balance of cash and cash equivalents exceeded million 
the revolver contains restrictions on the declaration and payment of dividends and the issuance of debt 
in addition  our asa with northwest contains cross default provisions to any indebtedness that we may owe to northwest 
the notes do not contain mandatory prepayments tied to our cash balance  restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends  or default provisions tied directly to our asa with northwest 
eliminating these restrictions gives us more flexibility to determine the best uses of our free cash flow and to manage our balance sheet in the best interests of our shareholders 
for a more detailed discussion of the notes  refer to recent developments in item of this form k 
we are committed to communication  personal development and respect for all of our people 
we intend to continue to work with our people to achieve high levels of operating performance and customer service at the lowest possible cost consistent with achieving our service objectives 
our corporate education center has been and will be instrumental in training and developing our people to meet these objectives

prior to september  northwest was our majority owner and designed our operations to increase overall northwest system revenues rather than to maximize our stand alone profitability 
under our previous capacity purchase arrangements  northwest retained the ability to adjust the revenues and margins we would receive under those arrangements 
in contrast to the prior arrangements  the asa establishes the compensation structure for our services throughout the term of the agreement in a manner designed to better align our revenues and earnings with our underlying cost drivers  such as block hours and cycles

a significant portion of the payments we receive from northwest are based on the actual operation of our aircraft 
northwest is solely responsible for scheduling flights  and the asa does not require northwest to meet any minimum utilization levels for our aircraft 
as noted in the discussion of our asa  we receive reimbursement of certain operating expenses necessary to provide regional airline capacity to northwest and payments based on pre set rates for fixed costs  completed block hours and completed cycles 
we also receive margin payments on these items which are intended to achieve a target operating margin 
our operating results are not significantly impacted by any seasonality trends historically associated with the airline industry

revenue associated with expense reimbursements  excluding margin  increased by million  or regional airline services revenue per crj block hour for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  which represents a decrease of approximately 
revenue per cycle increased by from  to  the variances in revenue per block hour and cycle are due primarily to an increase in the average length of our flights of over the same periods 
revenue from regional airline services for was negatively impacted by severe weather 
during the last week of december  adverse weather closed or reduced operations at over of the airports we serve 
these difficulties were in part responsible for a drop in our average performance statistics for the six months ended december  falling below the standards contained in the asa 
as a result  during the first quarter of  we paid northwest million in settlement of performance related penalties  an amount which was treated as a reduction in revenue in the fourth quarter 
we have begun to implement certain upgrades to those operational and communication systems that were overburdened as a result of the adverse 
table of contents item management sdiscussionandanalysis of financial condition and results of operations compared to continued weather and have also developed interim policies should additional severe weather impact a large portion of the network prior to the completion of the systems upgrades 
operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses of during was primarily due to the increase in the size of our aircraft fleet 
operating expenses for the year ended december  included significant increases related to the growth of our fleet  including higher wages and benefits  ground handling services  hub fees  fuel costs  landing fees and aircraft rentals 
operating expense per block hour decreased by 
salaries  wages and benefits increased by million  or  primarily due to the increase in the number of pilots and flight attendants of and  respectively  as well as wage rate and benefit increases 
an increase in other employee benefits  primarily the cost of employee insurance  accounted for the remaining increase in salaries  wages and benefits 
aircraft fuel expense increased million  or  due to the increase in block hours  which was partially offset by decreased fuel burn resulting primarily from a increase in the average length of our flights 
in accordance with the asa  passenger fuel costs are reimbursed in full by northwest and capped at per gallon 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expenses that are reimbursed by northwest increased principally due to required heavy airframe maintenance checks performed on our crj aircraft during heavy airframe maintenance checks were performed on aircraft during versus five aircraft in this accounted for approximately million of the increase in reimbursed maintenance expenses 
the remaining increases in maintenance expense  both reimbursed and unreimbursed  were due mainly to the increase in our level of operations and the expiration of warranty on a portion of our fleet 
aircraft rental expense increased million  or  due to the addition of aircraft to our fleet 
as previously noted  we sublease our crj aircraft from northwest under operating leases that expire december  the monthly lease rates include certain fleet management costs of northwest and are not representative of the rates paid by northwest to third party lessors 
northwest reimburses aircraft rental expense in full under the asa 
other rentals and landing fees increased due to an increase in landing fees of approximately million  or approximately  which is largely due to our increased level of operations and a change in the mix of cities where we provide passenger service 
ground handling services increased by million  or  due primarily to the increase in the number of departures performed 
the increase in ground handling expense per departure was caused by a change in the mix of cities where we provide passenger service 
other expenses that are reimbursed by northwest increased primarily due to increases in property taxes of million  incremental passenger screening costs of million  and passenger liability insurance of million 
the increase in unreimbursed other expenses was driven by our increased level of operations  most notably an increase of million of expenses associated with overnight travel for our pilots and flight attendants  million associated with new pilot training and million in canadian air traffic control costs 
additionally  million of the increase is attributable to increases in certain insurance premiums and due to professional service expenses associated with state tax planning and the compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of income tax expense was unchanged from to during the third quarter of  we lowered our income tax expense by approximately million following a reduction in a previous estimate of our tax obligations for the reduction in our estimate occurred following the filing of our state and federal income tax returns and was primarily due to changes in the apportionment of taxable income to those states 
table of contents item management sdiscussionandanalysis of financial condition and results of operations compared to continued where we operate 
this change in estimate increased our basic and diluted earnings per share by approximately for the year ended december  compared to an increase in operating revenue of million was primarily caused by the addition of crj aircraft and provisions of our asa with northwest  which became effective march and was in place for all of this increase was partially offset by the decrease in revenue from the removal of saab aircraft from our fleet 
crj block hours and cycles increased by and  respectively  which accounted for increased revenue of million and million  respectively 
as previously noted  our asa was amended at the time of our public offering to reduce our target operating margin from to effective december  this reduction in target margin lowered our revenue from regional airline services and operating income by million 
revenue associated with expense reimbursements increased by million  or 
the margin associated with block hours  cycles and expense reimbursements accounted for the remaining increase in operating revenue in  which was partially offset by the elimination of performance incentives in performance incentives accounted for approximately million of regional airline services revenue during regional airline services revenue per crj block hour for the years ended december  and were million and million respectively  which represents a decrease of approximately 
this decrease was due to the increase in the average length of our flights over the same periods 
operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses during was primarily due to the increase in the size of our aircraft fleet 
operating expenses for the year ended december  included significant increases related to the growth of our fleet  including higher wages and benefits  ground handling services  hub fees  fuel costs  landing fees and aircraft rentals 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in expense for aircraft maintenance  depreciation and the refund of previously paid passenger screening costs 
the increases in wages and benefits  ground handling  fuel costs  landing fees and aircraft rentals were primarily due to the increase in our crj fleet  while hub facility fees increased pursuant to the terms of the asa 
operating expense per available seat mile decreased by or cents per mile 
this decrease is due primarily to the removal of saab aircraft from our fleet  which have fewer seats than the crj aircraft 
salaries  wages and benefits increased primarily due to the increase in the number of crj pilots  flight attendants and mechanics and wage rate and benefit increases 
the number of pilots  flight attendants and mechanics increased by  and  respectively 
aircraft fuel expense increased primarily due to increased block hours and the higher burn rate associated with jet equipment 
in accordance with the asa  passenger fuel costs are reimbursed in full by northwest and capped at per gallon 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs increased primarily due to the increase in the size of our fleet and reflects the fact that our crjs were largely covered by the manufacturers warranties 
aircraft rental expense increased primarily due to additional leased crj aircraft and higher crj rental rates under the asa 
the increase in aircraft rental expense was partially offset by the decrease in rent associated with our leased saab aircraft  which were removed from our fleet prior to other rentals and landing fees increased primarily due to capacity increases and increased hub facility fees as provided by the terms of our asa 
ground handling services increased primarily due to increased flying associated with the growth of the crj fleet 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared to continued depreciation expense decreased primarily due to increased depreciation of approximately million during on our flight equipment to coincide with the removal of the saab aircraft from our fleet 
the decrease was partially offset by the increased depreciation on aircraft spares  tools and equipment for the crj aircraft 
other expenses decreased primarily due to an increase in property and other taxes of million  which was more than offset by a decrease in other expenses  primarily passenger liability insurance

the notes generally trade in secondary markets at a premium to the value that they could be converted into 
for instance  at the time the notes were issued  if any of the conditions for conversion had been met  holders of the notes could have converted each  principal amount of notes into cash and stock totaling only because of this premium associated with the option value imbedded in the notes  we do not believe that a significant number of holders of the notes would choose to convert the notes prior to their maturity if any of the conditions allowing for conversion are met 
in the event that a significant number of the notes were converted prior to their maturity  we would use internally generated cash flow and  to the extent necessary  issue other debt or equity securities to raise additional capital to satisfy the cash requirements of such conversions

investing activities consisted of rotable renewable parts purchases of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our results include a payment of million to acquire contractual rights from northwest to operate an additional crjs during the remaining term of the asa 
pursuant to this agreement  we will pay northwest an additional million in the remaining balance of investing activities consisted primarily of ground equipment purchases related to the new crj aircraft 
we expect next year s investing activities to be funded from cash flows from operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued financing activities 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million

cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
we made principal payments to northwest on our note payable in the amount of million during and received a million capital contribution from northwest in conjunction with our offering  which we applied to our note payable 
during  we had net borrowings of approximately million under our lines of credit 
as of december   we had million of available borrowings under our revolver with northwest and million of standby letters of credit outstanding 
we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million excluding the million for the contractual rights from northwest discussed above  primarily relating to crj aircraft rotable and expendable parts and tooling  software application and automation infrastructure projects and maintenance and ground equipment 
we are expecting to fund these expenditures with cash flows generated from our operations 
we have no significant capital commitments as of december  guarantees and indemnifications 
we are the guarantor of approximately million aggregate principal amount of tax exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon 
these bonds were issued by the memphis shelby county airport authority the authority and are payable solely from our rentals paid under a long term lease agreement with the authority 
the leasing arrangement is accounted for as an operating lease in the consolidated financial statements 
we are party to numerous contracts and real estate leases in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for tort liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract or occupancy of the leased premises 
in some cases  this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties  but usually excludes any liabilities caused by their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
additionally  we typically indemnify the lessors and related third parties for any environmental liability that arises out of or relates to our use of the leased premises 
in our aircraft lease agreements with northwest  we typically indemnify the prime lessor  financing parties  trustees acting on their behalf and other related parties against liabilities that arise from the manufacture  design  ownership  financing  use  operation and maintenance of the aircraft and for tort liability  whether or not these liabilities arise out of or relate to the negligence of these indemnified parties  except for their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
we expect that we would be covered by insurance subject to deductibles for most tort liabilities and related indemnities described above with respect to real estate we lease and aircraft we operate 
we do not expect the potential amount of future payments under the foregoing indemnities and agreements to be material 
off balance sheet arrangements 
none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with these leased assets  however  the lease agreements do not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase option or other similar guarantees 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements
