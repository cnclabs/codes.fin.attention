item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k  which is incorporated here by reference 
as of september   we employed approximately research and development personnel 
we are focusing our current research and development on increasing the performance of our array test  array repair and cell and module inspection systems  enabling manufacturers to minimize the loss of time and materials in production 

table of contents we are committing significant engineering efforts toward product improvement and next generation product development 
we will continue to invest in research and development to maintain technology leadership in our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the introduction  marketing and cost effective manufacture of any of our new products  that we will be able to timely develop and introduce new products and enhance our existing products and processes to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance  or that the new markets for which we are developing new products or expect to sell current products will develop sufficiently 
manufacturing our flat panel display products are primarily manufactured in san jose  california 
we perform design  assembly and testing in house and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of a majority of our components and subassemblies 
our in house manufacturing activities consist primarily of final assembly and test of components and subassemblies that are acquired through third party vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products 
as of september   we employed approximately manufacturing personnel 
we schedule production based upon customer purchase orders and anticipated orders during the planning cycle 
we generally expect to be able to accept a customer order  build the required machinery and ship to the customer within approximately to weeks 
we maintain quality control through inspection of components  in process inspection during equipment assembly and final inspection and operation of all manufactured equipment prior to shipment 
although we assemble some components and final test our systems under limited clean room conditions  most of our manufacturing occurs in standard manufacturing space 
because of the long lead time required to manufacture a customer order and the cyclical nature of the business  a significant increase in orders could necessitate a build up in inventory and therefore initially have a negative impact on cash 
for example  during the last half of fiscal  we experienced a major production increase associated with our generation repair products 
this resulted in an increase of inventory from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal suppliers many of the parts  components and subassemblies collectively parts are standard commercial products  although certain parts are made to our specifications 
we use numerous vendors to supply parts for the manufacture and support of our products  however  we obtain some parts for our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
for example  we currently obtain material handling platforms from a single source supplier 
although we seek to reduce dependence on our single source and limited group suppliers  alternative sources of supply for certain pieces of equipment may not be available or may be available on unfavorable terms 
the partial or complete loss of a single source or limited group of suppliers or any delay in shipment from a single source or limited group of suppliers could at least temporarily harm our results of operations and damage customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these pieces of equipment could harm our results of operations 
to date we have not experienced the loss of any single source or limited group of suppliers or any related delays in shipment 
intellectual property we protect our proprietary technology through various methods such as patents and patent applications  trademarks  non disclosure agreements and trade secrets 
we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and have also jointly filed patent applications in japan with ihi 
as of october   we have been issued patents in the united states that are in force 
the normal expiration dates of these patents range from to as of october   there are pending patent applications in the united states 
as of october   we have been issued non us patents that are in force  the normal expiration dates beginning in  and there are non us pending patent applications 

table of contents our patents relate to various aspects of our yield management solutions as set forth in the following table as of october  patents in force us us yield management products other total we intend to continue to pursue the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws 
however  we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights 
backlog our backlog consists of unshipped system orders  unearned revenue and systems in deferred gross margin 
as of september   our backlog was approximately million  compared to approximately million as of september  we expect to ship or to recognize revenue on the majority of the september backlog within the next six to twelve months 
all orders are subject to delay or cancellation with limited or no penalty to the customer 
because of possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders  among other factors  our backlog may vary significantly and  at any particular date  is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
competition the worldwide market for integrated yield management systems is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition from established companies  many of which have greater financial  engineering and manufacturing resources  larger service organizations and long standing customer relationships with key existing and potential customers 
we may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources 
our competitors primarily are micronics japan co 
ltd  applied komatsu technology  inc and shimadzu corporation in array testing  laserfront technologies  inc  ntn corporation  contrel limited  charm engineering co  ltd and hoya continuum corporation in array repair and several competitors in the cell and module inspection market 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics 
in addition  our customers may choose to develop proprietary technology that may obviate or lessen their need to purchase our products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure may necessitate price based competition  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that we can compete effectively with our competitors by building on our substantial installed customer base  providing technologically superior  competitively priced products and emphasizing our easy to use user interfaces and customer support 
however  realizing and maintaining such advantages will require a continued high level of investment by us in engineering  research and development  marketing and customer service and support 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments 
even if sufficient funds are available  we may not be able to make the technological advances in a timely manner necessary to maintain such competitive advantages 
significant competitive factors in the market for our yield management systems include system performance  ease of use  reliability  installed base and technical service and support 
we believe that  while price and delivery are important competitive factors  the customers overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and repair capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes  thereby enhancing productivity 

table of contents our yield management systems for the flat panel display industry are intended to compete based upon performance and technical capabilities 
these systems may compete with less expensive and more labor intensive manual inspection devices 
employees as of september   we employed persons 
no employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relationships with our employees to be good 
competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the flat panel display industry 
our future success may depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management and technical employees 
business combinations in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources  we may also seek to acquire new technologies from external sources 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  possible write downs of impaired assets  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
in august  we acquired from tucson optical research corporation torc all of the assets related to the design and manufacture of pellicle products which are used in our modulators 
this acquisition has enabled us to reduce product costs of modulators used in our array checker products while improving performance 
in june  we acquired from quantum composers  inc all of the assets related to the design and manufacture of laser assembly products used in our repair product line 
this acquisition has enabled us to reduce product costs while improving performance 
in may  we acquired substantially all of the assets of summit imaging  inc  a privately held designer and manufacturer of cooled cameras for the capital equipment industry 
this acquisition has enabled us to reduce the costs of cameras used in our flat panel display yield management products while improving performance 
in october  we purchased certain assets from intevac  inc related to intevac s rapid thermal processing rtp division 
the rapid thermal processing systems use a patented technology designed to activate low temperature poly silicon films utilizing a precise heating process critical to the manufacture of advanced active matrix  thin film transistor liquid crystal displays and organic light emitting diodes 
this acquisition expanded our flat panel display product offering 
due to deterioration of business conditions and lower than expected demand for low temperature poly silicon film technology  as of december   we determined that all the goodwill and intangible assets associated with this rtp reporting unit had been impaired and  as a result  their carrying value was reduced to zero 
due to deteriorating business conditions and the emergence of alternative and competing technologies  we continued only to support rtp systems in the field until march  we currently are not pursuing new business for systems upgrades or enhancements for the foreseeable future
