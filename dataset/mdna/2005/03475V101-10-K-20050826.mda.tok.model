overview angiodynamics is a provider of innovative medical devices used in minimally invasive  image guided procedures to treat peripheral vascular disease  or pvd 
we design  develop  manufacture and market a broad line of therapeutic and diagnostic devices that enable interventional physicians interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons and others to treat pvd and other non coronary diseases 
we believe that we are the only company whose primary focus is to offer a comprehensive product line for the interventional treatment of these diseases 
for the past five fiscal years  over of our net sales were from single use  disposable products 
the following table sets forth our aggregate net sales from the following product categories for our last three fiscal years dollars in thousands angiographic products and accessories hemodialysis catheters venacure products image guided vascular access products pta dilation catheters thrombolytic products drainage products other total we sell our broad line of quality devices in the united states through a direct sales force comprised of sales representatives  six regional managers and a vice president of sales 
outside the united states  we sell our products indirectly through a network of distributors in markets 
for each of our last three fiscal years  less than of our net sales were in markets outside the united states 
our growth depends in large part on the continuous introduction of new and innovative products  together with ongoing enhancements to our existing products  through internal product development  technology licensing and strategic alliances 
approximately of our sales growth over our past two fiscal years is attributable to products in three categories hemodialysis catheters  image guided vascular access  or igva products  and our venacure product line that were either obtained from or developed under licensing arrangements with third parties 
we also achieved significant growth in sales of angiographic catheters and pta dilation catheters  which we developed internally 
additionally  about of our net sales for fiscal were from products introduced in the last five years 
for each of the past three fiscal years  we invested at least of our net sales in research and development 
research and development expenditures were of net sales for fiscal and we expect these expenditures to continue to increase in future years to reach of net sales by the end of and remain at that level thereafter 
in addition  with the completion of our initial public offering and the spin off of our company by e z em  inc  we now intend to seek to grow through selective acquisitions of complementary products  technologies or businesses 
our cash resources are limited and  except to the extent we can use our equity securities as acquisition capital  we will require additional equity or debt financing to fund any significant acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify or consummate any such acquisitions or that any required financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us or at all 

table of contents for fiscal  approximately of our net sales were derived from products manufactured for us by third parties  compared to for fiscal we intend to continue to manufacture more of these products to achieve lower product costs and increased profitability 
we recently expanded our facility to provide us with significantly greater manufacturing capacity and to accommodate additional research  development and administrative requirements 
we are not currently operating our facility at full capacity 
our ability to further increase our profitability will depend in large part on improving gross profit margins 
factors such as changes in our product mix  new technologies and unforeseen price pressures may cause our margins to grow at a slower rate than we have anticipated or possibly to decline 
for example  until recently  sales of the disposable components used in our venacure laser products  which carry high margins  have lagged behind sales of the lower margin diode lasers 
there is significant competition among physicians to perform peripheral interventional procedures for pvd and other non coronary diseases 
we believe that the interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons who comprise our primary customer base will continue to capture a significant portion of these procedures due to several factors  including the increased focus by interventional radiologists on improving their clinical practice management skills and the increased partnering of interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons 
however  as interventional procedures have gained greater acceptance  other medical specialists  particularly cardiologists  are competing for patients with peripheral vascular and other non coronary disorders  and we expect this competition to intensify 
if these physicians increase their share of interventional treatments at the expense of our primary customers  we may be at a competitive disadvantage 
several of our competitors are focused primarily on cardiology and have established relationships with many cardiologists  and may be better positioned than us to take advantage of any increased opportunities for sales to these physicians 
in  we made a strategic decision to focus on the market for interventional therapies for pvd and to exit the cardiovascular disease market due primarily to intensive competition and the significant resource requirements for competing successfully in that market 
through the effective date of our initial public offering  our primary sources of financing were loans and capital contributions from our former parent company  e z em  long term bank debt and cash generated from operations 
as we are no longer a subsidiary of e z em  we will not receive any further financing from e z em 
in addition  to preserve the tax free nature of our spin off from e z em we are  and until october  will be  subject to restrictions on our ability to raise capital by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  or to use our equity securities to acquire other businesses or assets 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all these significant accounting policies affect the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require us to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectability is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
decisions relative to criterion iii regarding collectability are based upon our judgments  as discussed under accounts receivable below  and should conditions change in the future and cause us to determine this criterion is not met  our results of operations may be affected 
we recognize revenue as products 
table of contents are shipped  based on fob shipping point terms when title passes to customers 
we negotiate shipping and credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved by us and  if approved  customers are subject to a restocking charge 
to be accepted  a returned product must be unadulterated  undamaged and must have at least months remaining prior to its expiration date 
accounts receivable accounts receivable  principally trade  are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
for the period from the beginning of fiscal to may   our write offs of accounts receivable aggregated  income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we calculate income tax expense for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate deferred tax assets  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income and capital gains 
where their recovery is not likely  we estimate a valuation allowance and record a corresponding additional tax expense in our statement of income 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to changes in assumptions  the provision for income taxes could be materially affected 
as of may   our valuation allowance and net deferred tax asset were approximately  and million  respectively 
we have a tax allocation and indemnification agreement with e z em with whom we will file consolidated federal tax returns for periods through october  under this agreement  we pay federal income tax based on the amount of taxable income we generate and are credited for federal tax benefits we generate that can be used by us or other members of the consolidated group 
this agreement does not cover tax liabilities arising from state  local and other taxing authorities to whom we report separately 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of cost on the first in  first out method or market 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
as of may   may   and may   our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was   and  respectively 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost  less accumulated depreciation  and depreciate these assets principally using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we determine this based on our estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
we evaluate these assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
any change in condition that would cause us to change our estimate of the useful lives of a group or class of assets may significantly affect depreciation expense on a prospective basis

these charges are treated as non cash items for cash flow purposes and as increases to additional paid in capital 
as a percentage of net sales  other expenses  net  were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
income tax 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively  compared to the federal statutory rate of

however  we recorded imputed interest charges for fiscal and of  and  respectively 
these imputed interest charges were treated as non cash items for cash flow purposes and as increases in additional paid in capital 
net capital expenditures  primarily for facility expansion and machinery and equipment  were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million for fiscal of the fiscal expenditures  million was for the expansion of our headquarters and manufacturing facility 
this expansion was substantially completed during the fourth fiscal quarter of at an approximate cost of million  of which million was financed by industrial revenue bonds 
to secure this financing  we entered into agreements with local municipalities  a bank  a trustee and a remarketing agent 
these agreements are referred to as the ida agreements 
the proceeds of the bonds were advanced as construction occurred 
the bonds reprice every seven days and are resold by a remarketing agent 
the bonds bear interest based on the market rate on the date the bonds are repriced and require quarterly principal payments ranging from  to  plus accrued interest through may we entered into an interest rate swap with a bank to convert the initial variable rate payments to a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the ida agreements contain financial covenants relating to fixed charge coverage and interest coverage 
at may   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the outstanding debt is collateralized by a letter of credit million at may  and a first mortgage on the land  building and equipment comprising our facility in queensbury  and we are required to pay an annual fee ranging from to of the outstanding balance depending on our financial results 
the current fee is and is in effect until november the debt covenants related to the industrial revenue bond financing and our bank line of credit  and the collateralization of substantially all of our assets to secure these financings  may restrict our ability to obtain debt financing in the future 
we are also restricted in our ability to obtain equity financing due to the distribution by e z em of our stock to its stockholders  which was completed on october  we are limited in the amount of equity securities or convertible debt we can issue in the two years following the stock distribution by e z em in order to preserve the tax free treatment of the distribution and avoid tax liabilities to e z em and its stockholders and corresponding liabilities to us 
specifically  we are limited to to issuing no more than approximately million shares of our common stock in capital raising transactions over this period 
these factors could limit our sources of capital in the future

cash payments due by period as of may  total less than one year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations notes payable to bank operating leases consulting contracts the non cancelable leases and consulting contracts are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering  together with our current cash and investment balances  cash generated from operations and existing lines of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated needs for capital for at least the next months 
if we seek to make significant acquisitions of other businesses or product lines  we will require additional financing

risk factors you should carefully read and consider the risks described below 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be adversely affected 
in any such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to the other information in this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and the related notes 
if we fail to develop new products and enhance existing products  we could lose market share to our competitors and our results of operations could suffer 
the market for interventional devices is characterized by rapid technological change  new and improved product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
to be successful  we must develop and commercialize new products and enhanced versions of our existing products 
our products are technologically complex and require significant planning  design  development and testing before they may be marketed 
this process generally takes at least nine to months and may take up to several years 
our success in developing and commercializing new versions of our products is affected by our ability to timely and accurately identify new market trends  accurately assess customer needs  minimize the time and costs required to obtain regulatory clearance or approval  adopt competitive pricing  timely manufacture and deliver products  accurately predict and control costs associated with the development  manufacturing and support of our products  and anticipate and compete effectively with our competitors efforts 
market acceptance of our products depends in part on our ability to demonstrate that our products are cost effective and easier to use  as well as offer technological advantages 
additionally  we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new versions of our products 
as a result of such difficulties and delays  our development expenses may increase and  as a consequence  our results of operations could suffer 

table of contents competition may decrease our market share and cause our revenues to decline 
the markets for interventional devices are highly competitive  and we expect competition to continue to intensify 
we may not be able to compete effectively  and we may lose market share to our competitors 
the principal competitors in the markets for our products currently include boston scientific  cook  cordis  cr bard  diomed  medcomp  and vnus medical technologies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  variety of products  technical capabilities  ability to develop and introduce new products  patent portfolios that may present an obstacle to our conduct of business  name recognition  and distribution networks and in house sales forces 
our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products earlier  in obtaining patent protection or regulatory clearance earlier or in commercializing new products or technologies more rapidly than us 
our competitors may also develop products and technologies that are superior to those we are developing or that otherwise render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may face competition from providers of other medical therapies  such as pharmaceutical companies  which may offer non surgical therapies for conditions that are currently or intended to be treated using our products 
our products are generally sold at higher prices than those of our competitors 
in the current environment of managed care  which is characterized by economically motivated buyers  consolidation among healthcare providers  increased competition and declining reimbursement rates  we are increasingly being required to compete on the basis of price 
if we are not able to compete effectively  our market share and revenues may decline 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our business may suffer 
our success depends in part on obtaining  maintaining and enforcing our patents  trademarks and other proprietary rights  and our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property 
we rely upon patent  trade secret  copyright  know how and trademark laws  as well as license agreements and contractual provisions  to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products 
however  these measures may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
our patents may not provide commercially meaningful protection  as competitors may be able to design around our patents to produce alternative  non infringing designs 
additionally  we may not be able to effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
although we require our new employees  consultants and corporate partners to execute confidentiality agreements  these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or  in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  may not provide adequate remedies 
if third parties claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  we may be forced to expend significant financial resources and management time defending against such actions and our results of operations could suffer 
third parties may claim that our products infringe on their patents and other intellectual property rights 
identifying third party patent rights can be particularly difficult because  in general  patent applications can be maintained in secrecy for at least months after their earliest priority date 
some companies in the medical 
table of contents device industry have used intellectual property infringement litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
if a competitor were to challenge our patents  licenses or other intellectual property rights  or assert that our products infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights  we could incur substantial litigation costs  be forced to make expensive changes to our product design  license rights in order to continue manufacturing and selling our products  or pay substantial damages 
third party infringement claims  regardless of their outcome  would not only consume our financial resources but also divert our management s time and effort 
such claims could also cause our customers or potential customers to purchase competitors products or defer or limit their purchase or use of our affected products until resolution of the claim 
in january  diomed filed an action against us alleging that our venacure products for the treatment of varicose veins infringe on a patent held by diomed for a laser system that competes with our venacure products 
diomed s complaint seeks injunctive relief and compensatory and treble damages 
for fiscal  sales of our venacure products accounted for approximately of our total sales 
if diomed is successful in this action  our results of operations could suffer 
we are dependent on single and limited source suppliers  which puts us at risk for supplier business interruptions 
we currently purchase significant amounts of several key products and product components from single and limited source suppliers 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenues were derived from sales of products manufactured for us by third parties 
in addition  approximately of our sales growth over our past two fiscal years was attributable to products that we licensed or obtained from third parties 
our principal single source supplier  medcomp  supplies us with substantially all of our hemodialysis catheters  which accounted for about of our revenues in fiscal medcomp also competes with us by selling a hemodialysis catheter for which it has not granted us exclusive rights and other catheters that we do not license from them 
additionally  we purchase the laser and laser fibers for our venacure products from biolitec  which also competes with us 
any delays in delivery of or shortages in those products and components could interrupt and delay manufacturing of our products and result in the cancellation of orders for our products 
any or all of these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products and components at any time 
we may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all 
any transition to alternate suppliers may result in production delays and increased costs and may limit our ability to deliver products to our customers 
furthermore  if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply  we would have to modify our products to use substitute components  which may cause delays in shipments  increased design and manufacturing costs and increased prices for our products 
if we do not maintain our relationships with interventional physicians  our growth will be limited and our business could be harmed 
physicians typically influence the medical device purchasing decisions of the hospitals and other healthcare institutions in which they practice 
consequently  our relationships with interventional physicians are critical to our continued growth 
we believe that these relationships are based on the quality of our products  our physician driven product development efforts  our marketing efforts and our presence at medical society meetings 
any actual or perceived diminution in the quality of our products  or our failure or inability to maintain these other efforts  could damage our current relationships  or prevent us from forming new relationships  with interventional physicians and cause our growth to be limited and our business to be harmed 
our lack of customer purchase contracts and our limited order backlog make it difficult to predict sales and plan manufacturing requirements  which can lead to lower revenues  higher expenses and reduced margins 
we do not generally have long term purchase contracts with our customers  who order products on a purchase order basis 
our typical order backlog is less than days 
these factors make it difficult to accurately forecast our component and product requirements 
our manufacturing and operating expenses are largely based 
table of contents on anticipated sales volume and a significant portion of these expenses are and will continue to be fixed 
we must plan production and order products and product components several months in advance of customer orders 
in addition  lead times for products and product components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for each component at any given time 
these factors expose us to a number of risks such as if we overestimate our requirements we may be obligated to purchase more inventory than we need  if we underestimate our requirements  we may have an inadequate product or product component inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and cause delays in shipments and revenues  and we may experience shortages of raw materials and product components from our vendors from time to time  which could delay the manufacturing and shipping of our products 
if we do not develop or maintain successful relationships with non us distributors  our growth may be limited  sales of our products may decrease and our results of operations may suffer 
for fiscal  we generated approximately of our revenues from sales outside of the united states 
all of our non us sales in recent periods were attributable to third party distributors  and our success in expanding non us sales in the future will depend on our ability to develop and manage a network of non us distributors and on the performance of our distributors 
because we generally do not have long term contracts with our distributors  our distribution relationships may be terminated on little or no notice 
in addition  some of our distributors are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us  may sell products that compete with ours or devote more efforts to selling other products  and may stop selling our products at any time 
if we lose any significant non us distributors  or if any of our distributors devote more effort to selling other products than to ours  our non us sales and results of operations may suffer and our growth may be limited 
additionally  because our products generally compete more on the basis of performance than price  they may not be as attractive to third party distributors as lower priced products 
consequently  our success in expanding non us sales may be limited if our distributors lack  or are unable to develop  relationships with important target customers in non us markets 
our business may be harmed if interventional cardiologists perform more of the procedures that interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons currently perform 
we market and sell our products primarily to interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons  who currently perform a large percentage of minimally invasive  image guided interventional procedures for pvd 
many of our competitors have focused their sales efforts on the cardiology market for interventional procedures 
since we have focused our sales and marketing efforts on interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons  our competitors may have advantages over us for sales to cardiologists 
consequently  if cardiologists perform more of the procedures currently performed by interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons  our revenues may decline and our business may be harmed 
our business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel 
our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel  including managerial  sales and technical personnel 
we are particularly dependant upon the efforts of eamonn p 
hobbs  our president and chief executive officer  a bio medical engineer with over years of experience in the interventional radiology  interventional cardiology and gastroenterology medical device industries 
mr 
hobbs is also the only business executive from the medical device industry to ever serve on the strategic planning committee of the society of interventional radiology 
we compete for key personnel with other companies  healthcare institutions  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers  and we do not have employment agreements with our executive officers 
our ability to maintain and expand our business may be impaired if we are unable to retain our current key personnel or hire or retain other qualified personnel in the future 

table of contents undetected defects may increase our costs and impair the market acceptance of our products 
our products have occasionally contained  and may in the future contain  undetected defects 
when these problems occur  we must divert the attention of our engineering personnel to address them 
we cannot assure you that we will not incur warranty or repair costs  be subject to liability claims for damages related to product defects  or experience manufacturing  shipping or other delays or interruptions as a result of these defects in the future 
our insurance policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
in addition  the occurrence of defects may result in significant customer relations problems and injury to our reputation and may impair market acceptance of our products 
if a product liability claim is brought against us or our product liability insurance coverage is inadequate  our business could be harmed 
the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the type we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability 
our products are used by physicians to treat seriously ill patients 
those patients may bring claims in a number of circumstances and for a number of reasons  including if our products were misused  if they produced unsatisfactory results or if the instructions for use and operating manuals for our products were found to be inadequate 
claims could also be brought by our customers 
we currently are subject to an action claiming that we supplied a defective catheter that contributed to the death of a hemodialysis patient  and a similar action against us was recently settled by our supplier 
we carry a product liability policy with limits of million per occurrence and in the aggregate per year with a  deductible per incident and an aggregate deductible limit of  per year 
we believe  based on claims made against us in the past  that our existing product liability insurance coverage is reasonably adequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur 
we cannot assure you that this coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any claim made against us 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain adequate coverage at a reasonable cost and on reasonable terms  if at all 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing any coverage in the future 
additionally  if any such product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or is in excess of our insurance coverage  our business could be harmed 
further  such claims may require us to recall some of our products  which could result in significant costs to us and could divert management s attention from our business 
our quarterly operating results are volatile  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly results of operations have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including changes in our ability to obtain products and product components that are manufactured for us by third parties  as well as variations in prices of these products and product components  delays in the development or commercial introduction of new versions of our products or components we use in our products  our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products and product components  effects of domestic and foreign economic conditions on our industry and or customers  changes in the demand for our products  changes in the mix of products and systems we sell  delays in obtaining regulatory clearance for new versions of our products  increased product and price competition  changes in the availability of third party reimbursement for our products  the loss of key sales personnel or distributors  and seasonality in the sales of our products 

table of contents due to the factors summarized above  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are necessarily meaningful  or should necessarily be relied upon to predict future results of operations 
also  it is possible that in future periods  our results of operations will not meet the expectations of investors or analysts  or any published reports or analyses regarding angiodynamics 
in that event  the price of our common stock could decline  perhaps substantially 
healthcare reform could cause a decrease in demand for our interventional products 
there are currently widespread legislative efforts to control healthcare costs in the united states and abroad  which we expect will continue in the future 
for example  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of provides that from through  reimbursement levels for durable medical equipment will no longer be increased on an annual basis and a competitive bidding program will be introduced 
at this time  we are unable to determine whether and to what extent these changes will apply to our products and our business 
similar legislative efforts in the future could negatively impact demand for our products 
inadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other third party payors for procedures using our products may cause our revenues to decline 
changes in healthcare systems in the united states or elsewhere could adversely affect the demand for our products  as well as the way we conduct business 
third party payors have adopted  and are continuing to adopt  a number of healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs 
these policies include controls on government funded reimbursement for healthcare services and price controls on medical products and services providers  challenges to the pricing of medical procedures or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific devices and therapies through other means  and the introduction of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person 
we are unable to predict whether federal  state or local healthcare reform legislation or regulation affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future  or what effect any such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
these policies  or any reductions in the number of authorizations granted for procedures performed using our current and proposed products or in the levels of reimbursement for those procedures  could cause our revenues to decline 
outside of the united states  reimbursement systems vary significantly by country 
many foreign markets have government managed healthcare systems that govern reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
these systems are subject to the same pressures to curb rising healthcare costs and control healthcare expenditures as those in the united states 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors outside of the united states are not obtained  sales of our products outside of the united states may decrease and we may fail to achieve or maintain significant non us sales 
if we cannot obtain and maintain approval from governmental agencies  we will not be able to sell our products 
our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and in the foreign countries in which they are sold 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the united states must receive either k clearance or premarket approval from the fda before the product can be sold 
either process can be lengthy and expensive 
the fda s k clearance procedure  also known as premarket notification  is the process we have used for our current products 
this process usually takes from four to months from the date the application is submitted to  and filed with  the fda  but may take 
table of contents significantly longer 
although we have obtained k clearances for our current products  our clearances may be revoked by the fda if safety or effectiveness problems develop with the devices 
the premarket approval process is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
it generally takes from one to three years from the date the application is submitted to  and filed with  the fda  and may take even longer 
achieving premarket approval typically requires clinical trials and may require the filing of numerous amendments over time 
regulatory regimes in other countries similarly require approval or clearance prior to our marketing or selling products in those countries 
we rely on our distributors to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals of our products outside of the united states 
if we are unable to obtain additional clearances or approvals needed to market existing or new products in the united states or elsewhere  or obtain these clearances or approvals in a timely fashion  our revenues and profitability may decline 
modifications to our current products may require new marketing clearances or approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until such clearances or approvals are obtained 
any modification to an fda cleared medical device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use  requires a new and complete fda k clearance or  possibly  premarket approval 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make its own determination as to whether a modification requires a new k clearance or premarket approval  but the fda may review and disagree with any decision reached by the manufacturer 
we have modified aspects of some of our devices since receiving regulatory clearance 
we believed that some of these modifications did not require new k clearance or premarket approval and  therefore  we did not seek new k clearances or premarket approvals 
in the future  we may make additional modifications to our products after they have received fda clearance or approval and  in appropriate circumstances  determine that new clearance or approval is unnecessary 
regulations in other countries in which we market or sell  or propose to market or sell  our products may also require that we make judgments about changes to our products and whether or not those changes are such that regulatory approval or clearance should be obtained 
in the united states and elsewhere  regulatory authorities may disagree with our past or future decisions not to seek new clearance or approval and may require us to obtain clearance or approval for modifications to our products 
if that were to occur for a previously cleared or approved product  we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain the necessary clearance or approval 
under these circumstances  we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or other penalties 
if any of the foregoing were to occur  our business could suffer 
if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the fda s quality system regulation and other applicable post market requirements  our manufacturing operations could be disrupted  our product sales and profitability could suffer and we may be subject to a wide variety of fda enforcement actions 
after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements apply 
we are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the fda to determine our compliance with all regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply  it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions 
our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers must comply with the fda s quality system regulations  which governs the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  testing  manufacture  control  quality assurance  installation  servicing  labeling  packaging  storage and shipping of medical products 
the fda enforces the quality system regulations through unannounced inspections 
if we or one of our suppliers fails a quality system regulations inspection  or if a corrective action plan adopted by us or one of our suppliers is not sufficient  the fda may bring an enforcement action  and our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing delayed 
we are also subject to the fda s general prohibition against promoting our products for unapproved or off label uses and adverse event reporting requirements 
if we or our suppliers violate the fda s requirements or fail to take adequate corrective action in response to any significant compliance issue raised by the fda  the fda can take various enforcement actions  including an order to shut down manufacturing operations  a recall of products  fines  civil penalties  seizure of our 
table of contents products  refusing our requests for k clearance or pma approval of new or modified products  withdrawing k clearance or pma approvals already granted to us  and criminal prosecution 
if we are subject to fda enforcement action  our product sales and profitability could suffer 
in addition  most other countries require us and our suppliers to comply with manufacturing and quality assurance standards for medical devices that are similar to those in force in the united states before marketing and selling our products in those countries 
if we or our suppliers should fail to do so  we would lose our ability to market and sell our products outside of the united states 
even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval  our products may be subject to product recalls  which may harm our reputation and divert managerial and financial resources 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to order mandatory recall of our products or order their removal from the market if there are material deficiencies or defects in design  manufacture  installation  servicing or labeling of the device  or if the governmental entity finds that our products would cause serious adverse health consequences 
a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects  including labeling defects 
any recall of our products may harm our reputation with customers and divert managerial and financial resources 
we may require additional capital 
failure to attract additional capital could curtail our growth 
we may require additional capital to expand our business 
if cash generated internally is insufficient to fund capital requirements  we will require additional debt or equity financing 
in addition  we will require financing for any significant acquisitions we may seek to make 
needed financing may not be available or  if available  may not be available on terms satisfactory to us and may result in significant stockholder dilution 
we are subject to significant restrictions on our ability to issue equity securities or convertible debt to ensure that the distribution by e z em of our stock will be tax free to e z em and its stockholders 
in addition  covenants in our industrial bond financing and bank line of credit may also restrict our ability to obtain additional debt financing 
if we fail to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future  we could be forced to curtail our growth strategy by reducing or delaying capital expenditures and acquisitions  selling assets  restructuring our operations or refinancing our indebtedness 
any disaster at our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our ability to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time  which could cause our revenues to decrease 
we conduct all of our manufacturing and assembly at a single facility in queensbury  new york 
this facility and our manufacturing equipment would be difficult to replace and  if our facility is affected by a disaster  could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
additionally  we might be forced to rely on third party manufacturers or to delay production of our products 
insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from disasters may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  if one of our principal suppliers were to experience a similar disaster  uninsured loss or under insured loss  we might not succeed in obtaining adequate alternative sources of supplies or products 
any significant uninsured loss  prolonged or repeated disruption  or inability to operate experienced by us or any of our principal suppliers could cause significant harm to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have not paid and have no plans to pay cash dividends 
we have not previously paid any cash dividends and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 

table of contents risks related to our relationship with and separation from e z em we have limited ability to engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions using our equity  or to obtain equity financing  because of the federal income tax requirements for a tax free distribution 
for the distribution of our stock by e z em to qualify as tax free to e z em and its stockholders  there must not be a change in ownership of or greater in either the voting power or value of either our stock or e z em s stock that is considered to be part of a plan or series of transactions related to the distribution 
for a change in ownership occurring after the distribution to be characterized as part of a plan  there must have been an agreement  understanding  arrangement or substantial negotiations regarding the acquisition or a similar acquisition at some time during the two year period ending on the date of the distribution 
however  the shorter the time period between the distribution and change in ownership  the greater the burden of establishing that the two events are not part of a plan 
under a safe harbor provision  a distribution and acquisition will not be considered part of a plan if the distribution is motivated by a corporate business purpose other than the acquisition and the acquisition occurs more than six months after the distribution  provided that there was no agreement  understanding  arrangement or substantial negotiations with respect to the acquisition or a similar acquisition during the period that begins one year before the distribution and ends six months thereafter 
for the reason described above  our ability to use our stock for acquisitions and other similar strategic transactions  to raise capital  or for compensation for employees and others  will be restricted 
many of our competitors use their equity to complete acquisitions  to expand their product offerings and speed the development of new technology and to attract and retain employees and other key personnel  giving them a potentially significant competitive advantage over us 
our obligation to indemnify e z em if we cause the distribution to not be tax free could discourage or divert a third party from acquiring us and could result in substantial liability 
our master separation and distribution agreement with e z em provides that we will indemnify e z em if the distribution by e z em of its angiodynamics shares does not qualify as a tax free distribution due to actions we take or that otherwise relate to angiodynamics  including any change of ownership of angiodynamics 
the process for determining whether a change of ownership has occurred under the tax rules is complex 
if we do not carefully monitor our compliance with these rules  we might inadvertently cause or permit a change of ownership to occur  triggering our obligation to indemnify e z em 
our obligation to indemnify e z em if a change of ownership causes the distribution not to be tax free could discourage or prevent a third party from making a proposal to acquire us 
in addition  our financial obligations under this indemnity obligation could be substantial 
members of two families may have significant influence over our affairs due to their ownership of a significant amount of our stock 
members of the stern and meyers families and their affiliates own in the aggregate approximately of our outstanding common stock and are able to significantly influence  if not exercise control over  our important corporate and business matters 
additionally  this control may delay  deter or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us 
as a result  this control may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders and may  in turn  reduce the market price of our common stock 
some of our directors may have conflicts of interest because they are also directors of e z em  and some of our directors and executive officers own e z em stock or options to purchase e z em stock 
three of our directors  messrs 
echenberg  meyers and stern  are also be directors of e z em 
these directors have obligations to both companies and may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us  including  for example  acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for 
table of contents both us and e z em 
a number of our directors and executive officers own e z em stock or options to purchase e z em stock they acquired as directors or employees of e z em 
these ownership interests could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when these directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and e z em 
the agreements we have entered into with e z em in connection with our initial public offering could restrict our operations 
we and e z em have entered into several agreements governing our separation from e z em and our future relationship 
the terms and provisions of these agreements may be less favorable to us than terms and provisions we could have obtained in arm s length negotiations with unaffiliated third parties 
under these agreements with e z em  we have agreed to take actions  observe commitments and accept terms and conditions that are or may be advantageous to e z em but are or may be disadvantageous to us 
the terms of these agreements include obligations and restrictive provisions  including  but not limited to an agreement to indemnify e z em  its affiliates  and each of their respective directors  officers  employees  agents and representatives from all liabilities that arise from our breach of  or performance under  the agreements we have entered into with e z em in connection with the separation and for any of our liabilities  an agreement to indemnify e z em for certain tax liabilities and for any action or inaction by us that causes the distribution by e z em of our stock to its stockholders to be taxable to e z em or its stockholders  an agreement to not change our significant accounting principles for periods in which our financial results are included in e z em s consolidated financial statements  unless we are required to do so to comply  in all material respects  with generally accepted accounting principles and sec requirements  and an agreement not to compete with e z em s current business activities for a period of two years 
we face risks associated with being a member of e z em s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes 
until october   we were included in e z em s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes 
under a tax allocation and indemnification agreement we have entered into with e z em  we will pay e z em the amount of federal income taxes that we would be required to pay if we were a separate taxpayer not included in e z em s consolidated return 
in addition  under the tax allocation agreement  e z em will effectively control substantially all of our tax decisions and will have sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings  including tax audits relating to e z em s consolidated income tax returns in which we are included 
moreover  notwithstanding the tax allocation and indemnification agreement  federal law provides that each member of a consolidated group is liable for the group s entire tax obligation 
thus  to the extent e z em or other members of the group fail to make any federal income tax payments required of them by law  we could be liable for the shortfall 
provisions in our charter documents  our rights plan  delaware law and tax considerations related to the distribution by e z em may delay or prevent a change in control 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  our stockholder rights plan and under delaware law could make it more difficult for other companies to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions  among others  that may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third party a classified board of directors  advance notification procedures for matters to be brought before stockholder meetings  
table of contents a limitation on who may call stockholder meetings  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  and the ability of our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote 
the issuance of stock under our stockholder rights plan could delay  deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder  meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder unless various conditions are met  such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors 
any of these restrictions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
in addition  our master separation and distribution agreement with e z em provides that we will indemnify e z em for any taxes due if the distribution fails to qualify as tax free because of our actions or inactions 
an acquisition of us by a third party could have such an effect 
as a result  these tax considerations may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us in a transaction that our stockholders may otherwise considered favorable or reduce the amount they receive as part of the transaction 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on investments and financing that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
although we have entered into an interest rate swap with a bank to limit our exposure to interest rate change market risk on our variable interest rate financing  we do not currently engage in any other hedging or market risk management tools 
our excess cash is invested in highly liquid  short term  investment grade securities with maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for speculative or trading purposes 
changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on cash  cash equivalents and debt securities and therefore affect our cash flows and results of operations 
as of may   we were exposed to interest rate change market risk with respect to our investments in callable us government corporation and agency obligations in the amount of  the bonds bear interest at a floating rate established weekly 
for fiscal  the after tax interest rate on the bonds approximated 
each basis point or fluctuation in interest rates will increase or decrease interest income on the bonds by approximately  on an annual basis 
at may   we maintained variable interest rate financing of million in connection with our facility expansion 
we have limited our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank under which we agreed to pay the bank a fixed annual interest rate of and the bank assumed our variable interest payment obligations under the financing 
as of november   we renewed a million working capital line of credit with a bank 
advances under this line of credit will bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus basis points 
we are thus exposed to interest rate risk with respect to this credit facility to the extent that interest rates rise when there are amounts outstanding under the facility
