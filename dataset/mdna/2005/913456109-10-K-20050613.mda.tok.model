item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview universal corporation  through its subsidiaries and affiliates  is one of the world s leading independent leaf tobacco merchants and processors and has operations in agri products and the distribution of lumber and building products 
the company derives most of its tobacco revenues from sales of processed tobacco to manufacturers of tobacco products throughout the world and from fees and commissions for specific services 
by the end of fiscal year  universal saw the beginning of an oversupply of certain grades of flue cured tobacco as supply began to outpace demand 
however  during the two previous fiscal years ended march   the company operated in markets that were in balance or in slightly short supply with little excess inventory available to supply customers 
although african flue cured tobacco availability has continued to be somewhat depressed in the wake of the decline in supply from zimbabwe  previously one of the world s largest exporters of flue cured tobacco  south american volumes have increased dramatically to fill those requirements 
universal has made significant investments in crop expansion in a number of african countries  including malawi  mozambique  and zambia  to provide a more diverse supply base 
in addition  in the early part of this three year period  universal rationalized its operations and improved its processing capabilities in the united states to operate more efficiently amid continued declining demand for  and production of  us flue cured and burley tobacco due to uncompetitive pricing 
the lumber and building products segment has been weathering a long term recession in europe while expanding its operations through acquisitions  highlighted by the purchase in january of j w  a large molding manufacturer and distributor of diy supplies 
during the recession  the strength of the euro helped buoy us dollar translated income 
in addition  careful attention to cost control and customer service boosted the performance of the lumber and building products group 
during the past three fiscal years  the agri products segment experienced difficult markets for many of its products  especially sunflower seeds and tea  but in fiscal year  improved markets caused a significant increase in this segment s results 
heavy demands for capital to diversify tobacco sources  improve us processing capabilities  expand the lumber and building products business  and provide working capital for the agri products businesses have required the company to increase debt 
in the three fiscal years ended march   the company increased inventories  advances to suppliers  and receivables by million and spent million on capital projects and acquisitions 
in addition  the company returned funds to its shareholders in the form of million in dividends and million in share repurchases 
total debt doubled  rising to billion during that time  and the company has used funds from operations  bank debt  public debt  and secured financing to fund its needs over the period 
management expects to see the impact of larger flue cured crops in fiscal year  and due to drought in brazil  it is expected that there will be a shortage of certain styles of ripe leaf required by its customers  despite a general oversupply 

table of contents production in brazil expanded rapidly to replace lost volume from zimbabwe 
however in response to customer demand and to diversify risk  the company has made and continues to make significant investments in a number of african countries 
universal expects to see the benefits from larger volumes of african leaf beginning in fiscal year us volumes continue to decline due to non competitive leaf prices 
economic conditions in europe that affect the company s lumber operations remain difficult 
change in fiscal year end in august  universal s board of directors approved a change in universal s fiscal year end from june to march the new fiscal year better matches the fiscal reporting period with the crop and operating cycles of the company s largest operations  and the change allowed the company to eliminate a three month reporting lag previously used for most of its foreign subsidiaries 
in view of this change  the forthcoming discussion compares the consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended march  the transition period with the consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended march  in addition  wherever practicable  the discussion will compare the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year with the recast pro forma financial statements for the twelve months ended march  for purposes of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company believes that these comparisons provide a more meaningful analysis 
net income for the foreign subsidiaries for the three month period ended march   representing the elimination of the reporting lag  is reflected as an addition to retained earnings in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements for the nine month transition year ended march  in addition  the net change in cash and cash equivalents for foreign subsidiaries for this three month period is reported as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
throughout this discussion  data for all periods except as of and for the nine months ended march   and the twelve months ended march   are derived from the company s consolidated financial statements  which appear in this report 
all data as of and for the nine months ended march   are derived from our unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements  which are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
summary financial information for the twelve months ended march   recast to show historical results without the reporting lag for foreign subsidiaries  is found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which also includes more information on the derivation of the recast financial information 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year ended march   compared to recast twelve months ended march  sales and other operating revenues operating income fiscal year ended march  twelve months ended march  fiscal year ended march  twelve months ended march  recast recast tobacco lumber and building products agri products total segments corporate expenses restructuring costs equity in pretax earnings of unconsolidated affiliates consolidated total net income for the fiscal year that ended on march   was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the twelve months ended march   which has been recast for the effect of last year s change in fiscal year 
the results for fiscal year reflect a second quarter charge of million for announced eu fines on the company s subsidiaries due to their tobacco buying practices in spain 
as the fines are not tax deductible  the charge reduced net income for the fiscal year by million or per diluted share 
results for the recast twelve months ended march   included million for the settlement of the deloach lawsuit in may  million in charges for rationalizing us operations  and million in charges for rejected tobacco 
those charges totaled million after taxes  or per diluted share 
revenues were billion for fiscal year compared to billion for the recast prior year 
recast amounts for the twelve months ended march   are presented in the table above and in a footnote to the attached financial statements  and the following discussion addresses recast figures for fiscal year unless otherwise noted 
tobacco segment results improved by about for fiscal year to million 
the results for fiscal year include charges of million for the eu fines  and last year s recast results included the million deloach lawsuit settlement 
the positive comparisons caused by last year s million charge associated with customer rejected tobacco  coupled with this year s higher tobacco shipments from africa and brazil and earlier shipments of current crop oriental tobaccos  were partially offset by the effects of the changing monetary system in zimbabwe and lower volumes from europe 
changes in the monetary system in zimbabwe in january have created volatility in the company s results due to remeasurement of local currency earnings 
as a result  the company has been unable to offset inflationary cost increases with interest on local deposits or gains on conversion of us dollars into local currency  despite net benefits of about million in fiscal year  and this has negatively impacted current year comparisons 
these currency and fiscal policy related items negatively affected fiscal year earnings by about million 
in addition  in fiscal year  the company recognized a million allowance for the estimated loss on realization of certain value added tax credits in brazil due to changes in local laws 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on tax changes 
that charge  however  was partially offset by net currency remeasurement gains of million and a million recovery of other value added taxes there 
the improvement in tobacco results during fiscal occurred in the fourth quarter as the majority of the shipments that had been delayed from earlier quarters were completed  and tobacco provided most of the increase in earnings for the quarter 
tobacco revenues increased by about million for the year because of increases from shipments of larger crops in brazil and higher shipments from africa  which were largely offset by lower volumes from europe 
results for the company s lumber and building products segment increased by million  or  in fiscal year results reflected the benefits of slightly increased volume in construction supply markets and cost control in both construction and retail supply markets  which remain extremely competitive 
in addition  about half of the earnings increase arose from the appreciation of the euro  results from small acquisitions  pension adjustments  and gains from sales of real estate along with last year s divestiture of a small belgian operation 
revenues for this segment increased by million  nearly half of which was due to the strength of the euro 

table of contents higher volumes in the tea and rubber businesses were largely responsible for the million improvement in the company s agri products segment 
however  results for nuts and dried fruits were impacted by adverse conditions in cashew markets where suppliers defaulted on some contracted deliveries 
results for seeds were affected by a claim of a sunflower seed grower 
nearly of the million increase in revenue in the segment for the year arose from the acquisition of a controlling interest in a small company that trades nuts and dried fruits 
including this business  nuts and dried fruits represented about half of the growth in agri products revenues  however  results were limited by market conditions 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased at a faster rate than revenues in part because of additional costs of complying with the internal control requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act section  which increased external consulting and audit costs by about million during the year 
in addition  higher legal fees were required to respond to the european union s actions regarding the company s european tobacco buying practices 
the million provision for value added tax credits in brazil was also included in this account  as was the million of brazilian vat refunds 
interest expense increased compared to last year primarily due to higher debt balances and  to a lesser extent  increasing interest rates 
the company s annual effective tax rate was approximately for fiscal year  primarily because of the non deductible eu fines 
before the effect of the eu fines  the tax rate was in line with the prior year 
the company s effective tax rate remains above the statutory us rate due to excess foreign taxes recorded in countries where the tax rate exceeds the us rate  and local tax expense recorded by a foreign subsidiary with a us dollar loss for fiscal year

the charges related to rationalizing us operations 
gross revenues were approximately billion for the nine months ended march   compared to about billion for the same period in the prior year 
revenues were higher in all business segments 
most of the increase in tobacco segment revenue for the nine months came from larger volumes shipped from south america 
the nine months also benefited from the impact of a stronger euro on translation of revenues from european operations in both tobacco and lumber 
in addition  revenues increased due to the operations of j w  acquired in january agri products revenues were up due to increased volume and prices in tea and rubber 
tobacco segment earnings increased by about to about million for the nine months ended march   compared to the same period the prior year 
tobacco operations benefited from larger shipments from south america 
table of contents and processing improvements in the united states despite smaller crops in both areas 
the us improvements were due to efficiencies and yield enhancements from a new north carolina plant and a refurbished virginia plant 
the impact of lower shipments from africa in the nine months was partially offset by interest income in zimbabwe  which increased by million due to higher interest rates on larger local currency cash balances accumulated because of limitations on uses of those funds 
near the end of the nine month transition year  a customer of a foreign subsidiary rejected certain shipments of tobacco because they did not meet that customer s requirements 
no sales revenue or profit has been reported on these shipments  which were made during the four months after the subsidiary s second fiscal quarter 
management has estimated the cost associated with this tobacco  primarily shipping costs 
the company recorded a charge related to this matter of million  before taxes  during the period ended march  of the charge  million is related to shipments delivered in the three months ended december   and is reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended march  the balance of the million related to shipments delivered in january and reduced the income of foreign subsidiaries recorded as a direct addition to retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets 
us tobacco operations reflected the benefit of a one time shift in the allocation of fixed factory overhead associated with the change in the company s fiscal year end 
universal recognizes its fixed factory overhead expense in the united states in the quarters in which the tobacco is processed 
since processing does not normally occur during the period between april and june  the projected overhead expense for that period has historically been allocated to the preceding three quarters of each fiscal year  based on volumes processed 
because of the change in fiscal year end to march  the factory overhead expense for the period from april through june   was reported in fiscal year results  and was allocated to the subsequent quarters of that fiscal year 
operating income for each quarter of the nine month transitional year ended march   reflected this benefit 
had fiscal year included the estimated fixed factory overhead expense for april through june   tobacco segment operating income would have been million lower for the nine months 
including the estimated effect of the us fixed factory overhead allocation  pro forma tobacco segment operating earnings were up by million  or  for the nine months 
the following table provides data that is comparable to the results of the nine months ended march  in thousands of dollars nine months ended march  nine months ended march  tobacco segment operating income  as reported estimated us overhead allocation pro forma tobacco segment operating income segment operating income from lumber and building products improved by about for the nine months ended march   to million 
the increase is due to the strength of the euro  which gained more than on average compared to the same period the prior year  and the acquisition of j w 
throughout the nine month period  volume  especially in the construction supplies markets  suffered from the effects of an economic recession in the netherlands and other european countries 
although the sunflower seeds and rubber businesses improved  results from the agri products segment were down  due to disappointing performance of a small nut processor acquired the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended march   increased by million primarily due to the strength of the euro and the acquisition of j w 
interest expense increased by million due to higher average debt balances during the nine months 
the company s effective tax rate was compared to for the prior year 
the increase was primarily caused by changes in the mix of foreign earnings 
results of foreign subsidiaries for the three months ended march  along with its change in fiscal year end  the company also eliminated a three month reporting lag previously used by most of its foreign subsidiaries 
reported income for the nine month transition year included the results of the company s foreign subsidiaries for the nine months ended december  results of foreign subsidiaries for the three months ended march   which represented the reporting lag the lag quarter  were not reflected in the reported income  but were recorded as an addition to retained earnings 
operating income for the lag quarter was million  the major 
table of contents components of which arose from shipments of african  european  and oriental tobaccos and from lumber and building products operations 
a new currency auction system  sanctioned in zimbabwe in january  effectively reduced currency rates and caused remeasurement losses on local currency cash balances held there 
those remeasurement losses were million  and were partially offset by interest income of million on local currency balances 
lag quarter results were also reduced by a million charge  discussed above  which was part of the total million recorded to recognize the estimated cost of a claim against tobacco that did not meet customer requirements 
net income for the lag quarter was million 
accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the act 
fsp no 
provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the subsidy available under the act to companies that sponsor retiree medical programs with drug benefits that are actuarially equivalent to those available under medicare 
in addition to the direct benefit to a company from qualifying for and receiving the subsidy  the effects include expected changes in retiree participation rates and changes in estimated health care costs that result from the act 
fsp no 
was effective for universal for the interim period ending september   the second quarter of fiscal year the company believes that its postretirement benefit plan currently provides prescription drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to the new benefit available under medicare  and it therefore will qualify for the subsidy when it is implemented in the company concluded that the effects of the medicare subsidy did not constitute a significant event as defined in fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
as a result  the effects of the act were incorporated in the regular measurement of plan obligations reflected in the company s financial statements at the end of fiscal year the adoption of fsp no 
did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter statement no 

statement no 
amends accounting research bulletin no 
arb no 
to clarify that abnormal amounts of production related costs  such as idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials  should be recognized as current period charges rather than being recorded as inventory cost 
statement no 
also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory cost be based on the normal capacity of a company s production facilities 
universal is in the process of evaluating the effects of statement no 
on its accounting for production operations  but does not currently expect the impact to be material to its financial statements 
statement no 
is not effective for universal until fiscal year  however  earlier adoption is permitted 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 titled share based payment statement no 
r 
statement no 
r requires that share based payments  such as grants of stock options  restricted shares  and stock appreciation rights  be measured at fair value and reported as expense in a company s financial statements over the requisite service period 
the earlier guidance that statement no 
r replaced allowed companies the alternative of recognizing expense for share based payments in their financial statements or disclosing the pro forma effect of those payments in the notes to the financial statements 
universal periodically issues share based payments to employees under its compensation programs and has elected to make pro forma disclosures under the current accounting guidance 
in april  the us securities and exchange commission issued a rule delaying the effective date of statement no 
r until the beginning of the fiscal year that follows june  the company is now required to adopt statement no 
r as of april   which is the first quarter of fiscal year beginning in that quarter  the company will recognize expense over the service period for the fair value of all grants issued after march   as well as expense attributable to the remaining service period for all prior grants that have not fully vested by that date 
the company plans to make certain changes in its stock compensation program for future share based grants and is evaluating the alternative valuation models that may be used for share based payments issued after the adoption of statement no 
r 
at this time  the company does not expect the effect of adopting statement no 
r to be significantly different from the impact on net earnings reported in prior periods under the disclosure provisions of the existing statement no 
in december  the fasb issued two staff positions fsps addressing accounting and disclosure issues related to certain provisions of the american jobs creation act of  which was signed into law in october fsp no 
addresses the application of fasb statement no 
to the new tax deduction for qualified domestic production activities provided by this legislation 
fsp no 
addresses accounting and disclosure considerations related to the one time dividends received deduction the legislation provides to encourage us companies to repatriate earnings from foreign subsidiaries 
the company s current us tax position limits the potential benefit of both of these provisions of the american jobs creation act 
as a result  neither fsp had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview universal s liquidity and capital resource requirements are predominantly short term in nature and primarily relate to working capital required for tobacco crop purchases 
working capital needs are seasonal within each geographic region 
the geographic dispersion and the timing of working capital needs permit universal to predict its general level of cash requirements 
the marketing of the crop in each geographic area is heavily influenced by weather conditions and follows the cycle of buying  processing  and shipping of the tobacco crop 
the timing of individual customer shipping requirements may change the level or the duration of crop financing 
despite a predominance of short term needs  the company maintains a relatively large portion of its total debt as long term to reduce liquidity risk 
working capital working capital at march   was million  up million from the level at march  the increase was caused by a million increase in current assets other than cash  which principally comprised increases in accounts receivable of million  tobacco inventories of million  lumber inventories of million  and agri products inventories of million 
working capital levels were also affected by a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in customer deposits of million 
these changes were funded by commercial paper and revolving credit borrowings that are classified as long term debt because of the issuance  subsequent to fiscal year end  of a million private placement note  the proceeds of which were used to reduce those borrowings 
the increase in tobacco inventories was due to the weakness of the us dollar combined with delayed shipments from africa  and some carryover from an unusually large crop in brazil 
the company s uncommitted inventories decreased to approximately million compared to million at march  uncommitted tobacco stocks decreased from of total tobacco inventory at march   to of total tobacco inventory at march  management does not consider these levels excessive 
over the same period  agri products inventories increased by million due to the higher prices and volumes for tea and rubber  higher nut inventories  and the acquisition of the controlling interest in a nut joint venture 
advances to suppliers increased by million primarily due to the expansion of tobacco sources in africa 
the level of customer advances  which decreased by million  can vary from year to year as customers review their circumstances 
accordingly  the company considers such advances as borrowings when it reviews its balance street structure 
the million increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the strength of the euro 
the increase in the current portion of long term debt reduced the working capital by million 
capital spending the company s capital expenditures are generally limited to those that add value for the customer  replace equipment  increase efficiency  or position the company for future growth 
universal s capital expenditures were approximately million in fiscal year  million in the nine months ended march   before considering the lag quarter  and million in the year ended june  during the lag quarter  the company s capital expenditures were approximately million 
in fiscal year  much of the increase in capital spending was related to the company s announced construction of a new factory in mozambique  for which completion is expected in fiscal year approximately million of the capital expenditures in the nine months ended march   related to the completion of a major investment in leaf processing in the united states 
outstanding debt and other financing arrangements universal s total debt increased by about million during fiscal year  and its total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including total debt  deferred taxes  minority interests  and shareholders equity rose to about from at march   and approximately at june  the increase in debt reflected the effect of the stronger euro and the company s working capital investments and capital expenditures in africa and brazil 
the company has invested in these regions to expand and diversify tobacco sources to meet customer demand 
total long term obligations  including current maturities  increased by million to million while notes payable increased by million to million 
the increase in long term obligations was primarily due to the company s classification of million of borrowings supported by its revolving credit facility as long term debt because of the issuance  subsequent to the fiscal year end  of a million three year note in a private placement transaction to refinance those borrowings 
the note bears interest at libor plus and is callable by the company after one year 
the company also issued million of medium term notes due september  the proceeds were used to repay maturing long term debt of million and for other general corporate purposes 
the company has million remaining under a million shelf registration that became effective in august  and expects to use the proceeds of any sales of these securities for general corporate purposes  which may include the repayment of indebtedness  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and funding of working capital needs 

table of contents in february  moody s investors service moody s downgraded the company s long term credit ratings from baa to baa and short term credit ratings from p to p  but changed its outlook for the ratings from negative to stable 
standard poor s reduced the company s long term credit rating from a to bbb with a negative outlook 
in its public release dated february   moody s stated  the ratings could be downgraded if the ratio of expected retained cash flow to debt reached levels consistently below  or if earnings and cash flow instability observed in the past four quarters continued in the coming four quarters  preventing debt reduction 
as of march   the company s ratio of retained cash flow to debt  as defined by moody s  was about 
the short term rating downgrade has increased the company s short term borrowing costs 
if the company s credit ratings are lowered below investment grade in the future  then its interest costs would increase and access to capital markets could be significantly limited 
management communicates regularly with the rating agencies and plans to take necessary actions to maintain investment grade status 
during fiscal year  the company terminated interest rate swaps on million notional amount of long term debt for a gain of approximately million  which will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt 
from time to time  the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
these agreements typically adjust interest rates on designated long term obligations from fixed to variable 
the swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges 
at march   the company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements on million notional amount of long term debt 
these agreements effectively adjust interest rates from fixed to floating and are accounted for as fair value hedges 
near the end of fiscal year  universal entered a foreign currency swap with a third party to mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange rates related to a foreign currency denominated receivable from a subsidiary 
the swap converts a fixed rate  foreign currency denominated receivable to a fixed rate receivable denominated in us dollars 
it is accounted for as a cash flow hedge  and its notional amount was approximately million at march  as of march   universal had approximately billion in uncommitted lines of credit  of which approximately million was unused and available to support seasonal working capital needs 
the company s also has a five year committed revolving credit facility totaling million 
the facility will mature on january  as of march   the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
universal s commercial paper program  which provides flexibility in the company s short term borrowings  is supported by the revolving credit facility 
under the terms of its bank agreements  the company must maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and observe restrictions on debt levels 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at march  as noted above  subsequent to march   the company entered into a private placement transaction  borrowing million under a three year floating rate note 
the note bears interest at libor plus and is callable after one year 
the proceeds were used to retire short term notes  commercial paper  and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
funds supporting the company s erisa regulated domestic defined benefit pension plans increased by million to million because of positive market activity during the year ended december   the measurement date for the plan 
as of april   the market value of the fund was about million  compared to the accumulated benefit obligation abo of million and the projected benefit obligation pbo of million 
the abo and pbo are calculated on the basis of certain assumptions that are outlined in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company plans to contribute approximately million to the domestic pension fund during the next year  which is more than the contribution required by erisa 
it is the company s policy to monitor the market performance of the funds and to review the adequacy of its funding and its contributions to those funds 
the fund is managed for long term returns  and in may  the company elected to change its asset allocation slightly as a result of a month study of the plan s liabilities and the returns required to meet them 
the new allocation is to domestic securities  to international securities  and to fixed income securities 

table of contents contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of march   were as follows total thereafter notes payable and long term debt operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations tobacco lumber agri products agricultural materials capital expenditure obligations other purchase obligations total includes interest payments 
interest payments on million of variable rate debt are estimated on the basis of march  rates 
in addition to principal and interest payments on notes payable and long term debt  the company s contractual obligations include operating lease payments  inventory purchase commitments  and capital expenditure commitments 
operating lease obligations represent minimum payments due under leases for various production  storage  distribution  and other facilities  as well as vehicles and equipment 
tobacco inventory purchase obligations primarily represent contracts to purchase tobacco from farmers 
the amounts shown above are estimates since actual quantities purchased will depend on crop yield and prices will depend on the quality of the tobacco delivered 
more than half of the company s contracts to purchase tobacco are with farmers in brazil 
tobacco purchase obligations have been partially funded by advances to farmers  which totaled approximately million as of march  commitments to purchase agri products inventories are frequently matched to forward sales contracts with customers 
capital expenditure obligations represent the company s outstanding contractual commitments to complete and equip a new tobacco processing factory and related facilities in mozambique 
management believes that its financial resources are adequate to support its capital needs 
those resources include cash from operations  cash balances  the potential to issue debt to the public under its shelf registration statement and the commercial paper market  and committed and uncommitted bank lines 
any excess cash flow from operations after dividends  capital expenditures  and any necessary debt reduction will be available to fund expansion  purchase the company s stock  or otherwise enhance shareholder value 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company  including information about contingencies  risk  and financial condition 
the company believes  given current facts and circumstances  its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
however  changes in the assumptions used could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements 
the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas inventories inventories of tobacco and agri products are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the specific cost method 
in the tobacco and agri product businesses  raw materials are clearly identified at the time of purchase 
the company tracks the costs associated with raw materials in the final product lots  and maintains this identification through the time of sale 
the company also capitalizes direct and indirect costs related to processing raw materials 
this method of cost accounting is referred to as the specific cost or specific identification method 
lumber and building products inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out method 
the company writes down inventory for changes in market value based upon assumptions related to future demand and market conditions 
future demand assumptions can be impacted by changes in customer sales  changes in customers inventory positions and 
table of contents policies  competitors pricing policies and inventory positions  changing customer needs  and varying crop sizes and qualities 
market conditions that differ significantly from those assumed by management could result in additional write downs 
the company experiences inventory write downs routinely 
inventory write downs in fiscal year  the transition year ended march   and fiscal year were million  million  and million  respectively 
intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill as necessary  and at least annually  utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
the preparation of discounted future operating cash flow analyses requires significant management judgment with respect to operating earnings growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the majority of the company s goodwill is from acquisitions in the tobacco segment 
neither a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption nor a one percentage point decline in the cash flow growth rate assumption would result in an impairment charge 
however  significant changes in estimates of future cash flows  such as those caused by unforeseen events or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on its expected income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and evaluating the tax position of the company 
the effective tax rate is applied to quarterly operating results 
the company  through its subsidiaries  is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions  and could be subject to a tax audit in each of these jurisdictions  which could result in adjustments to tax expense in future periods 
in the event that there is a significant  unusual  or one time item recognized in the company s results  the tax attributed to that item would be recorded at the same time as the item 
for example  in fiscal year  the company recorded a charge for certain fines imposed by the european commission that will not be deductible for income tax purposes in the related countries where assessed 
no tax benefit was recognized on this charge  which increased the consolidated tax rate 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in its tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not tax deductible  while others are related to timing issues  such as differences in depreciation methods 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in its financial statements 
the company has recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of estimated future taxable income was not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
during the nine months ended march   the company received a significant dividend from a foreign subsidiary that enabled the company to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the company expects foreign tax credit carryforwards to be generated in future periods 
any significant reduction in future taxable income and changes in its sources or changes in us or foreign tax laws could result in the expiration of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the company s financial statements for which payment has been deferred or an expense that has not yet been recognized in the financial statements and has been deducted in the company s tax return 
for additional disclosures on income taxes  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the measurement of the company s pension and postretirement obligations and costs are dependent on a variety of assumptions used by the company s actuaries 
these assumptions include estimating the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
the assumptions made by the company may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
the significant assumptions used in the calculation of pension and postretirement obligations are discount rate the discount rate is based on investment yields available at the measurement date on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
salary growth the salary growth assumption is a factor of the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook  and assumed inflation 
expected return on plan assets the expected return reflects asset allocations and investment strategy 

table of contents retirement and mortality rates retirement rates are based on actual plan experience along with the company s near term outlook

table of contents other information regarding trends and management s actions the company s financial performance depends on its ability to maintain efficient operations and to secure the tobacco volumes desired by its customers 
in fiscal year  worldwide flue cured production by exporting countries excluding china increased by  on the strength of a very large brazilian crop  and in fiscal year  flue cured production is forecast to remain at that level 
burley crops increased by more than in fiscal year  but are expected to decline by in fiscal year bringing the two year increase to about 
for the second consecutive year  adverse weather conditions in brazil have caused a dearth of ripe leaf  which will make it difficult to provide all of the leaf qualities and styles needed to meet some customers requirements and could increase inventory levels there 
by fiscal year  african flue cured leaf volumes are expected to reach of the levels that existed before the long term decline in zimbabwean crops and that increase coupled with brazilian production expansion has caused an oversupply of some grades of flue cured tobacco 
us volumes continue to slide  reflecting non competitive leaf prices 
however  the recent buy out of the federal tobacco program  which eliminated support prices and production controls  and the weak dollar should provide us farmers a better competitive environment in the future 
economic conditions in europe that affect the company s lumber operations remain difficult  but markets for some portions of the agri product segment strengthened during fiscal year management remains confident that the company is well positioned to deal with the challenges of its markets 
the company expects that near term demand for leaf tobacco will be flat or declining slightly primarily due to the flattening trend in world cigarette consumption and to improved leaf utilization by cigarette manufacturers 
on a year to year basis  the company is susceptible to fluctuations in leaf supply due to crop size and leaf demand as manufacturers adjust inventories or respond to changes in the cigarette market 
the company estimates that industry worldwide uncommitted flue cured and burley inventories totaled about million kilos  excluding inventories of asian government owned monopolies  at march  of this amount  about million kilos are us tobaccos held by the commodity credit corporation for sale to the industry or by the us farmers stabilization cooperatives 
after four years of inventory declines  march balances represent an increase of about compared to inventory levels at march  with the large crops continuing in fiscal year  it is likely that industry inventories of uncommitted stocks will increase in the coming year 
although cigar consumption continues to grow at a modest pace in the united states  consumption within the main european union markets has declined slightly 
supplies of filler and binder tobaccos  which over the last several years have been in surplus due to overproduction in certain countries  have generally returned to a balance with demand 
the market for cigar wrapper continues to be firm 
within the smokeless segment of the dark tobacco business  consumption of loose leaf chewing tobacco continues to decline by about five percent annually  while the consumption of snuff products has been growing between three and four percent per year 
management believes that there is an adequate supply of suitable dark tobacco in the world market to meet the demand of the manufacturers of smokeless tobacco products 
the high price of us leaf relative to the world market has limited exports  which  combined with declining purchases by us manufacturers  have led to a decline in the amount of us tobacco produced and sold in the united states 
domestic leaf purchases are unlikely to increase because of the continued decline of cigarette consumption in the united states 
exports of us leaf are likely to continue to decline unless the competitive position of us leaf improves dramatically which is not likely in the near term 
however  the elimination of us price supports and production controls as a result of the tobacco buyout could provide an opportunity for more competitive production and market conditions in the future 
should the declines continue  the company has the risk that its us processing facilities would have excess capacity 
without substantial improvement in the market attractiveness of us leaf  foreign manufacturers are likely to continue to shift their purchases to other tobacco producing areas  such as brazil and africa where the company has significant operations 
because most of the shortfall from the decline in zimbabwe tobacco purchased at auction has been replaced with crops from areas where the company contracts with and provides financing to farmers  the company faces increased financing and inventory risk 
efforts to expand sources of african tobacco have required investments in working capital and operating facilities 
should tobacco production fail to fully develop in areas where the company is making these investments  tobacco volumes may not be sufficient for the company to operate at a satisfactory return in those areas 
the company s debt levels have been increasing as a result of its investment in expansion of tobacco sources  expansion of its agri products and lumber and building products businesses  rising commodity prices for agri products  and the weak us dollar 
in february  moody s investor service reduced the ratings on universal s senior long term debt from baa to baa standard poor s reduced the ratings from a to bbb 
management expects the trend of increasing debt to begin to reverse as investments in its businesses are completed  however the weakness of the us dollar may 
table of contents continue to adversely affect debt balances 
if the company does not succeed in significantly reducing its debt levels  its credit ratings could be lowered to below investment grade  which would cause access to debt markets to become more difficult and increase interest rates on new debt issuances 
the european union eu has taken action toward modifying the system of granting subsidies to tobacco farmers 
the eu subsidy makes up well over half of the revenue that a european farmer receives on a tobacco crop 
under the recently announced regime  no change in the current system is foreseen in crop years and which will be reflected in universal s and fiscal years respectively 
beginning with the crop fiscal year and through the crop fiscal year  however  of the subsidy has been decoupled from production 
the decoupling of the subsidy from production essentially means that a farmer can receive the subsidy granted in a reference period even if the farmer does not plant tobacco  so long as he keeps the land associated with that subsidy in good agricultural and environmental conditions 
however  the relevant member states  such as italy  greece  spain  and france  can increase the decoupled portion of the subsidy up to 
the remaining portion of the subsidy  or less shall remain subject to actual production of tobacco 
this means  in practical terms  that the total aid to tobacco farmers remains unchanged for those who continue  however  the incentive to grow tobacco does change and some growers could decide to leave production 
in each of the company s main european tobacco sources  such as italy  greece  spain  and france  tobacco production and processing is extremely important to the local economy 
consequently  management believes that the major tobacco producing countries will choose not to decouple more than of the subsidy  with the possible exception of some varieties less in demand by the market 
the company does not handle those varieties 
before the end of  the eu commission shall submit to the council of ministers a report on the implementation of the new tobacco subsidy system accompanied by appropriate proposals  if necessary 
in  the whole eu common agricultural policy will be under revision 
unless the system in place for the four crop years is extended to  as a consequence of the interim report prepared by the commission  then the decoupled portion would increase to  while the remaining would be used to finance restructuring activities in the tobacco regions 
the company has operations in new acceding countries  poland and hungary  who joined the eu on may  in those countries  the new system will not be de facto implemented before crop  and in the meantime  tobacco farmers will receive subsidies mainly financed by the domestic budget 
during fiscal year  customers located in hungary significantly reduced their purchases of hungarian leaf 
if this trend continues and exports do not increase  then the company s operations in hungary could be negatively affected 
management believes that some farmers will cease tobacco production  mainly in the marginal varieties for which member states will decide to increase decoupling to the maximum and to some extent in the market oriented growths 
it has been recently clarified that  in the subsidy system applicable to the interim period crops  the eu tobacco budget allocated to each producing country for payment of the coupled initially portion shall remain unchanged  even if total production drops within certain limits 
the farmers who continue to produce tobacco in countries where tobacco production declines during the interim period will receive a larger portion of the coupled subsidy then they would have if the eu tobacco budget had not been fixed for the interim period 
the decline in production will accelerate after the expiration of the interim period with the crop  unless action is taken to extend the system through year or alternative funds are made available at the national level 
the number of farmers who cease producing tobacco will depend on their efficiencies in production and the purchase price received for their tobacco 
management believes that after the crop  the major influence on the farmers decisions to produce tobacco will be the level of commercial prices for green tobaccos 
higher prices will depend on enhanced attention to quality and on whether the system can become more efficient by eliminating unproductive costs 
in addition  confirmed support from european tobacco product manufacturers will be crucial to the long term viability of tobacco production in europe 
a recent agreement between the italian ministry of agriculture and philip morris international provides for a increase under certain conditions of quality improvement of the local tobacco crops of purchases of italian flue cured and burley  for three years 
management believes that if farmer prices do not increase or  alternatively  if the member states do not choose to implement subsidies for tobacco production  the volume of tobacco produced in europe will decline over time 
in this case  the company s results of operations could be negatively affected 
the recorded value of the company s equity in net fixed assets that could be affected by these changes was approximately million 
in addition  unrealized currency losses for tobacco operations there were million  net of taxes  at march   million of which relates to hungary 
an important recent trend in the tobacco industry has been consolidation among manufacturers of tobacco products 
this trend is expected to continue  particularly as further privatization of state monopolies occurs  providing opportunities for acquisitions by international manufacturers 
this concentration could provide additional opportunities for international leaf merchants  including universal 
a key success factor for leaf dealers is the ability to provide customers with the quality of leaf and the level of service they desire at the lowest cost possible 
in addition  the international leaf dealers have larger historical market shares with some customers than with others 
consequently  the company s potential growth will be affected by the growth of its major customers  and consolidation of customers may have at least a short term favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s business 
in recent years  the growth of some of the company s customers has eliminated the need for some services that universal provides  and management expects that demand for those services will diminish 

table of contents additional attention by manufacturers to certain quality considerations and to social responsibility programs has increased universal s costs 
for example  dealing with claims for the presence of non tobacco related materials in packed tobacco has cost more than million during the last three fiscal years  and establishing worldwide farm programs to ensure that such materials are kept out of the green tobacco delivered to the factories is an ongoing cost 
in addition  universal has established programs for good agricultural practices and has been active in social responsibility endeavors in many of the third world countries in which it does business 
world markets for all of the products that the company handles are extremely competitive 
management is continuing to focus on cost reductions and efficiency improvements and has set an objective of eliminating million in costs by the end of fiscal year decreased social acceptance of smoking and increased pressure from anti smoking groups have had an ongoing adverse effect on sales of tobacco products  particularly in the united states 
also a number of foreign governments have taken or proposed steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion  to increase taxes on cigarettes  to prohibit smoking in public areas  and to discourage cigarette consumption 
a number of such measures are included in the framework treaty on tobacco control  which was negotiated under the auspices of the world health organization 
in some cases  such restrictions are more onerous than those proposed or in effect in the united states 
the company cannot predict the extent to which government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption might affect the business of its primary customers 
however  a significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for the company s products and services and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
in the year ended march   the weakness in the us dollar in relation to the euro benefited the company s lumber and building products operations  which use the euro as the functional currency 
further changes in exchange rates will affect the translation of the euro earnings of the company into us dollars 
in addition  a continued economic recession could further depress construction activity in the netherlands and negatively affect sales volumes and margins 
conversely  an increase of such activity could provide an opportunity for volume and margin expansion 
the company  through its subsidiaries  is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions  and from time to time contests assessments of taxes due 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws can affect the company s earnings  as can the resolution of various pending and contested tax issues 
the consolidated income tax rate is also affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the mix of domestic and foreign earnings and investments  local tax rates of subsidiaries  repatriation of foreign earnings  and the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credits 
in recent years  the company s domestic income has declined while foreign income has increased 
if this trend continues and tax rates remain constant worldwide  the company s ability to utilize its foreign tax credits could be diminished 
as a result  its consolidated income tax rate could increase 
the company expects foreign tax credit carryforwards to be generated in future periods 
factors that may affect future results the foregoing discussion contains certain forward looking statements  which may be identified by phrases such as the company expects or management believes or words of similar effect 
in addition  the company may publish  from time to time  forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  and similar matters 
the following important factors  among other things  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for a fiscal year and any interim period to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the company assumes no duty to update any of the statements in this report 
operating factors the leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive  and universal is heavily reliant on a few large customers 
the company is one of two major independent global competitors in the highly competitive leaf tobacco industry  all of whom are reliant upon a few large customers 
the loss of one of those large customers or a significant decrease in their respective demand for the company s products or services could further increase competition and significantly decrease the company s sales of products or services  which would have a material adverse effect on universal s results of operations 
the competition among leaf tobacco merchants is based on the ability to meet customer specifications in the buying  processing  and financing of tobacco  as well as the price charged for products and services 
however  because universal  like its competition  relies upon a few significant customers  the consolidation or failure of any of these large or significant customers could contribute to a significant decrease in its sales of products and services 

table of contents the company s financial results can be significantly affected by the changes in the balance of supply and demand for leaf tobacco or other agricultural products 
because universal is a leaf tobacco merchant  its financial results can be significantly affected by changes in the overall balance of worldwide supply and demand for leaf tobacco 
the demand for tobacco  which is based upon customers expectations of their future tobacco requirements  can change from time to time depending upon internal and external factors affecting the demand for their products 
the company s customers expectations  and thus their demand for leaf tobacco  are influenced by a number of factors  including trends in the global consumption of cigarettes  trends in sales of cigars and other tobacco products  and levels of competition 
the total supply of tobacco at any given time is a function of current tobacco production  inventories held by manufacturers  and the volumes of uncommitted stocks of processed tobacco from prior years production 
production of tobacco in a given year may be significantly affected by such factors as the amount of tobacco planted by farmers throughout the world  weather and natural disasters  and crop disease 
any significant change in these factors could cause a material imbalance in the supply and demand for tobacco  which would affect the company s results of operations 
similar factors can affect results for its agri products businesses 
the company s financial results will vary according to growing conditions  customer requirements and other factors 
these factors also reduce the ability to gauge the company s performance and increase the risk of an investment in universal 
the company s financial results  particularly the quarterly financial results  may be significantly affected by fluctuations in tobacco growing seasons and crop sizes 
the cultivation of tobacco is dependent upon a number of factors  including weather and other natural events  and the company s processing schedule and results of operations can be significantly altered by these factors 
further  the timing and unpredictability of customer  orders and shipments cause the company to keep tobacco in inventory  increase its risk  and result in variations in quarterly and annual financial results 
sales recognition by the company and its subsidiaries is based on the passage of ownership  usually with shipment of product 
since individual shipments may represent significant amounts of revenue  our quarterly and annual financial results may vary significantly depending on the needs and shipping instructions of the company s customers 
these fluctuations result in varying volumes and sales in given periods  which also reduce the comparability of financial results in different periods or in the same periods in different years 
major shifts in customer requirements for tobacco supply may significantly affect universal s operating results 
if the company s customers significantly alter their requirements for tobacco volumes from certain regions  then universal may have to change its production facilities and alter its fixed asset base in certain origins 
permanent or long term reduction in demand for tobacco from origins where the company has operations may trigger restructuring charges 
universal may also need to make significant capital investments in other regions to develop the needed infrastructure to meet customer supply requirements 
in areas where universal purchases its leaf tobacco directly from farmers  the company bears the risk that the tobacco it receives will not meet quality and quantity requirements 
when universal contracts directly with tobacco farmers or tobacco farmer cooperatives  which is the method it uses to purchase tobacco in most countries  the company bears the risk that the tobacco delivered may not meet customer quality and quantity requirements 
if the tobacco does not meet such market requirements  the company may not be able to meet all 
table of contents of its customers orders  which would have an adverse effect on its profitability and its results of operations 
in addition  in many foreign countries  when universal purchases tobacco directly from farmers  it provides them with financing 
unless the company receives marketable tobacco that meets the quality and quantity specifications of its customers  it bears the risk that it will not be able to fully recover its crop advances or recover them in a reasonable period of time 
although the company purchases a portion of its leaf tobacco through public auction  as well as privately negotiated contract purchases  several countries where auction markets are used today may be moving toward direct purchasing  thus increasing the areas subject to this risk 
weather and other conditions can affect the marketability of the company s products 
tobacco and many other agricultural crops that the company buys  such as sunflower seeds and tea  are subject to vagaries of the weather and the environment that can  in some cases  change the quality or size of the crops 
if a weather event is particularly severe  such as a major drought or hurricane  the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable to manufacturers  which would result in a reduction in revenues 
if such an event is also widespread  it could affect the company s ability to acquire the quantity of products required by its customers 
in addition  other items can affect the marketability of tobacco and other agricultural products  including  among other things  the presence of non tobacco related material  genetically modified organisms  and excess residues of pesticides  fungicides  and herbicides 
a significant event impacting the condition or quality of a large amount of any of the crops that universal buys could make it difficult for the company to sell these products or to fill customers orders 
a significant slowdown in home improvement or construction markets in the netherlands could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the majority of the customers who purchase lumber and building products from universal are located in the netherlands 
therefore  a significant slowdown in the home improvement or construction market in the netherlands could reduce demand for these products  which would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
regulatory and governmental factors government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption could have a significant impact on the businesses of universal s customers  which would  in turn  affect the company s results of operations 
the us federal government and certain state and local governments have taken or proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing us consumption of tobacco products and indirectly reducing demand for the company s products and services 
these activities have included the us environmental protection agency s decision to classify environmental tobacco smoke as a group a known human carcinogen  restrictions on the use of tobacco products in public places and places of employment  proposals to have the us food and drug administration regulate nicotine as a drug and sharply restrict cigarette advertising and promotion  proposals to increase the federal and state excise taxes on cigarettes  and the policy of the us government to link certain federal grants to the enforcement of state laws restricting the sale of tobacco products 
numerous other legislative and regulatory anti smoking measures have been proposed at the federal  state  and local levels 
excluding the effect of tobacco contained in cigarettes imported into the united states  the company estimates that between and of the flue cured and burley tobaccos that it handles worldwide is ultimately consumed in the united states 
universal s tobacco sales consist primarily of flue cured and burley tobaccos  which  along with oriental tobaccos  are the major ingredients in american blend cigarettes 

table of contents a number of foreign governments have also taken or proposed steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion  to increase taxes on cigarettes  and to discourage cigarette consumption 
a number of such measures are included in the framework treaty on tobacco control  which was negotiated under the auspices of the world health organization 
the company cannot predict the extent to which government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption might affect the business of its primary customers 
however  a significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for the company s products and services and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
because universal conducts a significant portion of its operations internationally  political uncertainties in certain countries could have an adverse effect on its performance and results of operations 
the company s international operations are subject to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments  principally in developing countries and emerging markets  and to the effects of changes in the trade policies and economic regulations of foreign governments 
these uncertainties and risks  which include  among other factors  undeveloped or antiquated commercial law and the expropriation or nationalization of assets  may adversely impact the company s ability to effectively manage its operations in those countries 
for example  in the past  universal has experienced significant year to year fluctuations in earnings due to changes in the brazilian government s economic policies  and government actions in zimbabwe have reduced the tobacco crop there  causing the company to shift sourcing of tobacco to other countries 
universal has substantial capital investments in south america and africa  and the performance of its operations in those regions can materially affect its earnings from tobacco operations 
if the political situation in any of the countries where the company conducts business were to deteriorate significantly  the company s ability to recover assets located there could be impaired 
to the extent that universal does not replace any lost volumes of tobacco with tobacco from other sources  or incurs increased costs related to such replacement  its results of operations would suffer 
changes in tax laws in the countries where universal does business may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company through its subsidiaries is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws can affect the company s earnings as can the resolution of various pending and contested tax issues 
for example  recent changes in tax law in the state of rio grande do sul in brazil which limit the amount of tax credits generated on interstate sales of tobacco in brazil will increase universal s cost of doing business in that country 
financial factors failure of universal s customers or farmers to repay extensions of credit could materially impact the company s results of operations 
universal extends credit to both farmers and customers 
a significant delay in payment or a significant bad debt provision related to amounts due to the company could adversely affect its results of operations 
in addition  crop advances to farmers are generally secured by the farmers agreement to deliver green tobacco 
in the event of crop failure  recovery of advances could be delayed until future crops are delivered 
failure of foreign banks in which universal s subsidiaries deposit funds or the failure to transfer funds or honor withdrawals may affect its results of operations 
funds held by the company s foreign subsidiaries are often deposited in their local banks  banks in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to a higher rate of failure or may not honor withdrawals of deposited funds 
in addition  the countries in which these local banks operate may lack sufficient regulatory oversight or suffer from structural weaknesses in the local banking system 
due to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments  these local banks also may be subject to exchange controls and therefore unable to perform transfers of certain currencies 
if the company s ability to gain access to these funds were impaired  it could have a material adverse effect on universal s results of operations 

table of contents universal has substantial debt outstanding which may limit the company s ability to secure future sources of financing 
if the company does not reduce debt levels or increase earnings  then its credit ratings could be lowered below investment grade  which would cause access to debt markets to become more difficult and increase interest rates on new debt 
the company may find it difficult to secure additional financing on satisfactory terms 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may affect universal s results of operations 
although the international tobacco trade generally is conducted in us dollars  thereby limiting foreign exchange risk to that which is related to production costs  overhead  and income taxes in the source country  the company s purchases of tobacco are often made in local currency 
as a result  changes in exchange rates can make a particular crop more or less attractive in the world market  thereby affecting the profitability of such crop and universal s results of operations 
because there is no forward foreign exchange market in many of the major countries where the company sources tobacco  universal manages its foreign exchange risk by matching funding for inventory purchases with the currency of sale and by minimizing its net investment in these countries 
to the extent that the company is not able to continue match funding  or otherwise hedge its exposure  the company could have a disproportionate exposure to local currency in which the tobacco was purchased 
certain of the company s operations use their local currency as the functional currency 
for example  the lumber and building products operations  which are based in the netherlands  use the euro as their functional currency 
in certain tobacco markets that are primarily domestic  the company uses the local currency as the functional currency 
examples of these domestic markets are hungary and poland 
in each case  reported earnings are affected by the translation of the local currency into the us dollar 
see also qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
in universal s tobacco business  customers usually pre finance purchases or pay market rates of interest for inventory purchased on order 
because of changes in financial markets  the company  like many others  has moved away from short term credit markets 
the company is borrowing more long term debt  and through hedging agreements  it is swapping the interest rates on its existing fixed rate debt to floating market interest rates to better match the interest rates that the company charges its customers 
to the extent universal is unable to match these interest rates  a decrease in interest rates could increase its net financing costs 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates interest rate risk is limited in the tobacco business because customers usually pre finance purchases or pay market rates of interest for inventory purchased for their accounts 
the company s tobacco customers pay interest on tobacco purchased for their order 
that interest is paid at rates based on current markets for variable rate debt 
if universal were to fund its committed tobacco inventory with fixed rate debt  the company might not be able to recover interest at that fixed rate if current market interest rates were to fall 
as of march   tobacco inventory of million included million in inventory that was committed for sale to customers and million that was not committed 
committed inventory  after deducting about million in customer deposits  represents the company s net exposure of about million 
universal maintains a substantial portion of its debt at variable interest rates in order to substantially mitigate interest rate risk related to carrying fixed rate debt 
debt carried at variable interest rates was million at march  although a hypothetical change in short term interest rates would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately million  approximately of that amount could be offset with changes in charges to customers 
currency the international tobacco trade generally is conducted in us dollars  thereby limiting foreign exchange risk to that which is related to production costs  overhead  and income taxes in the source country 
most of the tobacco operations are accounted for using the us dollar as the functional currency 
because there are no forward foreign exchange markets in many of universal s major countries of tobacco origin  the company manages its foreign exchange risk by matching funding for inventory purchases with the currency of sale  which is usually the us dollar  and by minimizing its net investment in individual countries 
in these countries  the company is vulnerable to currency gains and losses to the extent that any local currency balances do not offset each other 
the company recognized a million exchange loss due to remeasurement for the fiscal year ended march   compared to a thousand exchange loss due to remeasurement for the nine month transition year ended march   and a million remeasurement gain for the fiscal year ended june  the company recognized thousand in exchange gains from foreign currency transactions for the fiscal year ended march   compared to exchange gains of million for the transition year ended march   and exchange losses of thousand for the fiscal year ended june  the lumber and building products operations  which are based in the netherlands  use the euro as their functional currency 
in certain tobacco markets that are primarily domestic  the company uses the local currency as the functional currency 
examples of these domestic markets are hungary and poland 
in each case  reported earnings are affected by the translation of the local currency into the us dollar 
commodity universal uses commodity futures in its rubber trading business to reduce the risk of price fluctuations 
the company does not enter into rubber contracts for trading purposes 
all forward commodity contracts are adjusted to fair market value during the year  and gains and losses are recorded in income at that time 
the amounts recorded during fiscal years   and were not material 
derivatives policies hedging interest rate exposure using swaps and hedging foreign exchange exposure using forward contracts are specifically contemplated to manage risk in keeping with management s policies 
universal may use derivative instruments  such as swaps  forwards  or futures  which are based directly or indirectly upon interest rates  currencies  and commodities  to manage and reduce the risks inherent in interest rate  currency  and price fluctuations 
the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes  and it does not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
derivatives are transaction specific so that a specific debt instrument  contract  or invoice determines the amount  maturity  and other specifics of the hedge 
counterparty risk is limited to institutions with long term debt ratings of a or better
