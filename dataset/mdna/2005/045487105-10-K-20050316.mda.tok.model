item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is management s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the corporation 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
the financial discussion that follows may refer to the effect of the corporation s business combination activity  detailed under section  business combinations  and note  business combinations  of the notes to 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
the detailed financial discussion focuses on results compared to discussion of results compared to is predominantly in section compared to on april   the board of directors declared a for stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend  payable may to shareholders of record at the close of business on may all share and per share data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements has been adjusted to reflect the effect of this stock split 
certain amounts in the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the form k presentation 
in particular  for presentation purposes and greater comparability with industry practice  mortgage servicing rights expense in the consolidated statements of income  which was previously presented in noninterest expense  was reclassified into mortgage banking income 
these reclassifications resulted in a decrease to both noninterest income and noninterest expense of million in and million in the reclassifications had no effect on stockholders equity or net income as previously reported 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the allowance for loan losses  mortgage servicing rights valuation  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and income taxes 
the consolidated financial statements of the corporation are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
this preparation requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions  and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
management believes the following policies are both important to the portrayal of the corporation s financial condition and results and require subjective or complex judgments and  therefore  management considers the following to be critical accounting policies 
the critical accounting policies are discussed directly with the audit committee of the corporation 
allowance for loan losses management s evaluation process used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the evaluation process combines several factors management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss and delinquency experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses 
because current economic conditions can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict  the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses  and therefore the adequacy of the allowance  could change significantly 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require that certain loan balances be charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the corporation believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  loans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section allowance for loan losses 
mortgage servicing rights valuation the fair value of the corporation s mortgage servicing rights asset is important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements since the mortgage servicing rights are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value 
mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices 
as such  like other 
table of contents participants in the mortgage banking business  the corporation relies on an internal discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights and consults periodically with third parties as to the assumptions used and that the resultant valuation is within the context of the market 
in addition  the corporation periodically reviews the assumptions underlying the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
as part of this review  beginning with the third quarter valuation  the corporation changed the external service provider of prepayment speeds to a source management believed to provide a better representation of market value 
the impact of this change at the time of the change september  was an increase in fair value of mortgage servicing rights of million 
while the corporation believes that the values produced by its internal model are indicative of the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights portfolio  these values can change significantly depending upon key factors  such as the then current interest rate environment  estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages serviced  and other economic conditions 
to better understand the sensitivity of the impact on prepayment speeds to changes in interest rates  if mortgage interest rates moved up basis points bp at year end holding all other factors unchanged  it is anticipated that prepayment speeds would have slowed and the modeled estimated value of mortgage servicing rights could have been million higher than that determined at year end leading to more valuation allowance reversal and an increase in mortgage banking income 
conversely  if mortgage interest rates moved down bp  prepayment speeds would have likely increased and the modeled estimated value of mortgage servicing rights could have been million lower leading to adding more valuation allowance and a decrease in mortgage banking income 
the proceeds that might be received should the corporation actually consider a sale of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio could differ from the amounts reported at any point in time 
the corporation believes the mortgage servicing rights asset is properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  goodwill and intangible assets  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section noninterest income 
derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting in various aspects of its business  the corporation uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposures to changes in interest rates and market prices for other financial instruments 
substantially all of these derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings  and measurement of changes in the fair value of hedged items 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by the corporation no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  consequently  the change in the fair value of hedged items could be recognized in earnings  the impact on the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings could be significant 
the corporation believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section interest rate risk 
income tax accounting the assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities  will not differ from management s current assessment  the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings 
the corporation believes the tax assets and liabilities are adequate and properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section income taxes 
business combinations the corporation s business combination activity is summarized in note  business combinations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
all the corporation s business combinations since were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  thus  the results of operations of the acquired institutions prior to their respective consummation dates were not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in there were two completed business combinations first federal capital corp first federal on october   the corporation consummated its acquisition of of the outstanding shares of first federal  based in la crosse  wisconsin 
as of the acquisition date  first federal operated a billion savings bank with over banking locations serving more than communities in wisconsin  northern illinois  and southern minnesota  building upon and complementing the corporation s footprint

the value of the shares was determined using the closing stock price of the corporation s stock on september   the initiation date of the transaction 
goodwill of approximately million and a core deposit intangible of approximately million recognized initially in the transaction were assigned to the banking segment 

table of contents segment review as described in part i  section services  and in note  segment reporting  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation s primary reportable segment is banking 
banking consists of lending and deposit gathering as well as other banking related products and services to businesses  governments  and consumers and the support to deliver  fund  and manage such banking services 
the corporation s wealth management segment provides products and a variety of fiduciary  investment management  advisory  and corporate agency services to assist customers in building  investing  or protecting their wealth  including insurance  brokerage  and trust asset management 
note  segment reporting  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  indicates that the banking segment represents of total revenues  as defined in the note 
the corporation s profitability is predominantly dependent on net interest income  noninterest income  the level of the provision for loan losses  noninterest expense  and taxes of its banking segment 
the consolidated discussion is therefore predominantly describing the banking segment results 
the critical accounting policies primarily affect the banking segment  with the exception of income tax accounting  which affects both the banking and wealth management segments see section critical accounting policies 
overview the corporation is a multi bank holding company headquartered in wisconsin  providing a diversified range of banking and nonbanking services to individuals and businesses primarily in its three state footprint wisconsin  illinois and minnesota 
the corporation s primary sources of revenue are net interest income predominantly from loans and deposits  and also from investments and other funding sources  and noninterest income  particularly fees and other revenue from financial services provided to customers 
business volumes and pricing drive revenue potential  and tend to be influenced by overall economic factors  including market interest rates  business spending  consumer confidence  economic growth  and competitive conditions within the marketplace as well 
net interest income  including two months of contribution from the first federal acquisition  increased in compared to  primarily due to an increase in average earning assets 
the net interest margin declined from in to in the corporation has been asset sensitive for and  positioned to benefit from rising rates 
however  the flattening of the yield curve and competitive pricing pressures substantially offset the benefits to the margin from the interest rate increases that occurred through the second half of the corporation continues to be positioned to benefit from rising rates  assuming anticipated rate increases by the federal reserve and a steepening of the yield curve 
noninterest income declined in compared to  particularly from lower net mortgage banking income 
the corporation anticipated mortgage originations to fall dramatically in  and as such also expected lower net mortgage banking income down million or versus 
during  interest rates reached record lows  resulting in an unprecedented volume of mortgage loan originations and refinances and strong net mortgage banking income for a rapid rise in mortgage interest rates  particularly during late third quarter of  slowed mortgage loan volume  and industry expectations were for mortgage originations to fall dramatically in  which materialized 
the corporation s insurance agency acquisition and organic growth from its insurance agency acquisition aided growth in retail commissions up million or compared to 
noninterest income sources continue to be diversified  cross selling of services remains a focus  and pricing is routinely evaluated 
full year contributions in from the jabas and first federal acquisitions are expected to further enhance noninterest revenues 
commercial loans and home equity loans were strategically emphasized in and showed momentum particularly in the second half of period end loans at december   were billion  up over year end  with commercial  home equity  residential mortgage and installment loans up    and  respectively 
excluding the first federal acquisition  total loans grew  with commercial loans up  home equity up  and residential mortgages and installment loans down and  respectively  compared to year end the corporation s loan mix changed during  with emphasis on 
table of contents commercial and home equity loan growth  but influenced as well from the first federal acquisition 
the mix of loans at december   including first federal  was commercial versus last year  residential mortgage versus last year  home equity compared to a year ago  and installment loans versus last year 
the loan mix at year end excluding the first federal acquisition would have been    and commercial  residential mortgage  home equity  and installment  respectively 
increases in business spending and consumer confidence in and strategic growth objectives are expected to create an environment for increased earnings from loans 
period end deposits at december   were billion  up over the prior year end  with minimal shift in deposit mix 
the corporation s deposit mix at december   including first federal  was noninterest bearing demand compared to last year end  time deposits versus last year and interest bearing transaction accounts versus last year  where transaction accounts include savings  money market  and interest bearing demand deposits 
excluding the first federal acquisition  period end deposits grew compared to year end competition for deposits has been high for many years 
deposit retention is most at risk in the first year following acquisition 
further  there will be competitive pressures in  such as pricing deposits up in the anticipated rising rate environment and potential disintermediation to improving stock markets 
rational and balanced deposit growth initiatives will be used in the corporation anticipated that  among other factors  improving credit quality indicators and favorable workouts of credits  if sustained  could lead to a lower provision for loan losses for asset quality administration activities in resulted in early identification of potential problem credits  favorable resolution to problem credits  lower nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans  and net charge offs to average loans of 
as a result  the provision for loan losses was reduced to million  compared to million for at december   an allowance for loan losses to loans ratio of impacted in part by the acquisition of first federal s thrift loan mix and lower ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans was deemed adequate by management  covering of nonperforming loans at year end  compared to at december   covering of nonperforming loans 
certain economic indicators suggest that business spending has begun to increase and that business and consumer financial positions are improving in line with recent economic improvements 
conversely  it is unknown how rising interest rates  particularly seen in the second half of and anticipated for  will ultimately impact profitability of businesses or the ability to service potentially rising debt of businesses and consumers for management expects that the provision for loan losses will be higher than in  but anticipates it will be commensurate with credit quality indicators  net charge off levels  and unique circumstances of individual credits 
noninterest expenses rose year over year  reflecting the larger operating base attributable to the acquisitions 
excluding only first federal  noninterest expense for would have been unchanged from last year  evidencing that noninterest expenses remained both well controlled and a critical focus of the efficiency ratio defined as noninterest expense divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net asset and securities gains was for and for the corporation has and will continue to monitor costs  and anticipates certain cost savings from integrating first federal onto centralized operating systems in first quarter performance summary the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the million earned in basic earnings per share for were  a increase over basic earnings per share of 
earnings per diluted share were  a increase over diluted earnings per share of 
return on average assets and return on average equity for were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for cash dividends of per share paid in increased by over key factors behind these results are discussed below 
taxable equivalent net interest income was million for  million or higher than taxable equivalent interest income increased million  while interest expense decreased by mil 
table of contents lion 
the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income was attributable to favorable volume variances with balance sheet growth and differences in the mix of average earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities adding million to taxable equivalent net interest income  offset partly by unfavorable rate variances as the impact of changes in the interest rate environment reduced taxable equivalent net interest income by million 
average earning assets increased billion to billion  while interest bearing liabilities increased billion to billion 
net interest income and net interest margin were impacted by generally stable and historically low interest rates during and the first half of since mid year  the federal reserve raised interest rates five times 
the average federal funds rate of in was bp higher than the average rate in the net interest margin for was  compared to in the bp decrease in net interest margin was attributable to a bp decrease in interest rate spread the net of an bp decrease in the yield on earning assets  substantially offset by a bp lower cost of interest bearing liabilities  and a bp lower contribution from net free funds 
total loans were billion at december   up billion over december   attributable largely to the billion first federal loans acquired 
excluding first federal  total loans grew  with commercial loans up million  home equity up million  and with both residential mortgage and installment loans down  million and million  respectively 
total deposits were billion at december   up billion over year end  attributable largely to the billion first federal deposits acquired

nonperforming loans were million  representing of total loans at year end  compared to million or of total loans at year end net charge offs were million  a decrease of million from  with the majority of the decrease attributable to lower charge offs in the commercial loan portfolio 
net charge offs were of average loans compared to in given asset quality improvements  favorable resolution to problem credits  and an adequate level of allowance for loan losses  the provision for loan losses decreased to million compared to million in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans was and at december  and  respectively 
noninterest income was million for  million or lower than  impacted by significantly less net mortgage banking 
net mortgage banking income decreased million to million  driven by reduced secondary mortgage production and resultant loan sales 
retail commissions grew million over  primarily attributable to the acquisitions of the jabas and cfg insurance agencies in april and  respectively see section business combinations 
noninterest expense was million  up million or over  reflecting the larger operating base attributable to the acquisitions 
personnel expense rose million or over  while all remaining noninterest expense categories increased on a combined basis 
income tax expense increased to million  up million from the effective tax rate increased to in compared to in  primarily attributable to the increase in income before tax and the acquisitions of first federal and jabas  with both having higher effective tax rates than the corporation prior to the acquisitions 
income statement analysis net interest income net interest income in the consolidated statements of income which excludes the taxable equivalent adjustment was million  compared to million in the taxable equivalent adjustments the adjustments to bring tax exempt interest to a level that would yield the same after tax income had that income 
table of contents been subject to taxation using a tax rate of million for and million for resulted in fully taxable equivalent net interest income of million and million  respectively 
net interest income is the primary source of the corporation s revenue 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest earning and other assets or activities 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates  which factors in characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments  contractual maturities  repricing frequencies  and the use of interest rate swaps and caps 
interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund those assets 
the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds net free funds  principally demand deposits and stockholders equity  also support earning assets 
to compare tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  the yield on tax exempt loans and securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin are discussed on a taxable equivalent basis 
table provides average balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the associated interest income and expense  and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid  as well as net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis for the three years ended december  tables through present additional information to facilitate the review and discussion of taxable equivalent net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin 
taxable equivalent net interest income was million for  an increase of million or from taxable equivalent interest income increased million and interest expense decreased by million 
the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income was attributable to a higher level of earning assets  offset by unfavorable interest rate changes 
as shown in the rate volume analysis in table  volume changes added million to taxable equivalent net interest income  while rate changes resulted in an million decrease  for a net increase of million 
the growth and change in mix of earning assets added million to taxable equivalent net interest income in  while the growth and composition of interest bearing liabilities cost an additional million 
rate changes on earning assets reduced interest income by million  while the changes in rates on interest bearing liabilities lowered interest expense by million  for a net unfavorable impact of million 
the corporation has been asset sensitive for and  positioned to benefit from rising rates 
however  the flattening of the yield curve and competitive pricing pressures substantially offset the benefits to the margin from the interest rate increases that occurred through the second half of see additional discussion in section interest rate risk 
the net interest margin for was  compared to in the bp compression in net interest margin was attributable to a bp decrease in interest rate spread with an bp decrease in the yield on earning assets  substantially offset by a bp lower cost of interest bearing liabilities  and a bp lower contribution from net free funds a function of the overall decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates were generally stable and historically low during and the first half of since mid year  the federal government raised interest rates five times  each time by bp 
at december  the federal funds rate was  bp higher than the year low of at december  on average  the federal funds rate was for  bp higher than for for  the yield on earning assets fell bp to  comprised of a bp decrease in the yield on securities and other short term investments to and a bp decline in loan yield to 
the yield on investment securities decreased as maturities and principal paydowns were reinvested in securities with lower yields 
competitive pricing on new and refinanced loans  the portion of the loan portfolio that is fixed rate and the lag in repricing of variable rate loans in the rising interest rate environment put pressure on loan yields in  resulting in the bp decline in yield 
the earning asset rate changes reduced interest income

the cost of wholesale funds comprised of all short term borrowings and long term funding decreased bp to for  benefiting from a favorable mix of lower costing short term borrowings and timing of the maturity of and reinvestment in higher rate long term funds during the year 
the interest bearing liability rate changes resulted in million lower interest expense  with million attributable to interest bearing deposits and million due to wholesale funding 
average earning assets were billion in  an increase of billion  or  from the majority of the growth in average earning assets was organic  with the remainder attributable to the acquisition of first federal

equities represented over of the market value of assets under management for and service charges on deposit accounts were million  million higher than the increase was a function of higher volumes associated with the larger deposit account base particularly including first federal  and moderate fee increases in second quarter related to account service charges and nonsufficient funds 

table of contents net mortgage banking income was million  million lower than net mortgage banking income consists of gross mortgage banking income less mortgage servicing rights expense 
gross mortgage banking income which includes servicing fees and the gain or loss on sales of mortgage loans to the secondary market and other related fees was million in  a decrease of million compared to the lower income was primarily the result of significantly reduced secondary mortgage loan production mortgage loan production to be sold to the secondary market and resultant sales 
secondary mortgage loan production was billion for  down from the billion for gains on loan sales and fees were down million including a million lower reduction in the fair value of the mortgage derivatives position between year ends see also  note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on the other hand  mortgage servicing fees increased million over the average mortgage portfolio serviced for others was approximately higher for compared to mortgage servicing rights expense includes both the base amortization of the mortgage servicing rights asset and increases or decreases to the valuation allowance associated with the mortgage servicing rights asset 
mortgage servicing rights expense was million for  million lower than base amortization was million up million from last year  while a million recovery to the valuation allowance was recorded in compared to a million addition to the valuation allowance during 
the favorable change to the valuation allowance was principally due to slower loan prepayment speeds in versus  a predominant valuation factor used in the corporation s internal discounted cash flow model  increasing the recorded value of the mortgage servicing rights asset and requiring less valuation reserve 
mortgage servicing rights  net of any valuation allowance  are carried in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value 
at december   mortgage servicing rights including million from first federal at acquisition were million  net of a million valuation allowance  and represented bp of the billion mortgage portfolio serviced for others including the billion servicing portfolio from first federal

mortgage servicing rights are considered a critical accounting policy given that estimating their fair value involves an internal discounted cash flow model and assumptions that involve judgment  particularly of estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages serviced and the overall level of interest rates

loans of this type are in a diverse range of industries 
the credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operations or on the value of underlying collateral  if any 
borrower demand in this loan sector improved during  and price competition has been strong 
within the commercial  financial  and agricultural classification  loans to finance agricultural production totaled less than for all periods presented 
real estate construction loans grew million or to billion  representing of the total loan portfolio at the end of  compared to billion or at the end of loans in this classification are primarily short term interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial real estate  such as multifamily or other commercial development projects 
real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are well known to the corporation  have prior successful project experience  and are well capitalized 
projects undertaken by these developers are carefully reviewed by the corporation to ensure that they are economically viable 
loans of this type are primarily made to customers based in the corporation s tri state market in which the corporation has a thorough knowledge of the local market economy 
the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by general economic conditions 
the corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers  underwriting the loans to meet the requirements of institutional investors in the secondary market  reviewing the merits of individual projects  controlling loan structure  and monitoring project progress and construction advances 
commercial real estate includes commercial based loans that are secured by multifamily properties and nonfarm nonresidential real estate properties  and to a lesser degree by farmland 
commercial real estate totaled billion at december   up million or over december   and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end commercial real estate loans involve borrower characteristics similar to those discussed above for commercial loans and real estate construction projects 
loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial properties  multifamily properties  and community purpose properties 
loans are primarily made to customers based in wisconsin  illinois  and minnesota 
credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial loans and real estate construction by employing sound 
table of contents underwriting guidelines  lending to borrowers in local markets and businesses  periodically evaluating the underlying collateral  and formally reviewing the borrower s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis 
in many cases the corporation will take additional real estate collateral to further secure the overall lending relationship

home equity consists of home equity lines and residential mortgage junior liens  while installment loans consist of educational loans  and short term and other personal installment loans  such as direct and indirect automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  credit card loans  and other personal loans 
individual borrowers may be required to provide related collateral or a satisfactory endorsement or guaranty from another person  depending on the specific type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
credit risk for these types of loans is generally greatly influenced by general economic conditions  the characteristics of individual borrowers  and the nature of the loan collateral 
credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers as well as taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions 
factors that are important to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration  systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments  effective loan review on an ongoing basis  early identification of potential problems  an adequate allowance for loan losses  and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies 
an active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to further ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made 
credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures  comprehensive loan administration  and periodic review of borrowers outstanding loans and commitments 
borrower relationships are formally reviewed and graded on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems 
further analyses by customer  industry  and geographic location are performed to monitor trends  financial performance  and concentrations 
the loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers  industry groups  and market areas within our primary three state area 
significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions

table of contents allowance for loan losses credit risks within the loan portfolio are inherently different for each loan type 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  a thorough review of potential borrowers  and on going review of loan payment performance 
active asset quality administration  including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems  aids in the management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses 
credit risk management for each loan type is discussed briefly in the section entitled loans 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  an allocation methodology is applied by the corporation which focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired or other nonperforming loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  historical losses and delinquencies on each portfolio category  and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses 
assessing these factors involves significant judgment 
management considers the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy see section critical accounting policies and further discussion in this section 
see also management s allowance for loan losses accounting policy in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  loans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional allowance for loan losses disclosures 
table provides information on loan growth and composition  tables and provide additional information regarding activity in the allowance for loan losses  and table provides additional information regarding nonperforming loans and assets 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  compared to million at december   and million at year end as of december   the allowance for loan losses to total loans was and covered of nonperforming loans  compared to and  respectively  at december   and and  respectively  at december  the decline in the ratio of allowance to total loans at year end compared to year end was in part a result of acquiring the first federal thrift balance sheet  which added million allowance for loan losses and billion of loans or allowance to total loans ratio at consummation 
changes in the allowance for loan losses are shown in table credit losses  net of recoveries  are deducted from the allowance for loan losses 
a direct increase to the allowance for loan losses comes from acquisitions at consummation 
finally  the provision for loan losses  a charge against earnings  is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
with favorable resolution to problem credits in  lower net charge off and nonperforming loans ratios  and management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the provision for loan losses of million for was less than of million  and of million 
net charge offs were million or of average loans for  compared to million or of average loans for  and million or of average loans for see table

determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a function of evaluating a number of factors  including but not limited to changes in the loan portfolio see table  net charge offs see table  nonperforming loans see table  and evaluating specific credits 
as previously discussed  net charge offs as a percent of average loans steadied after two years of higher than historical levels  particularly in commercial charge offs 
as discussed under section loans  total loans were billion at december   up billion over december   attributable largely to the billion first federal loans acquired 
excluding first federal  total loans grew  with commercial loans up million  home equity up million  and with both residential mortgage and installment loans down  million and million  respectively 
despite the strong growth in commercial loans  the mix of loans including first federal shifted at year end  as evidenced in table  with commercial loans representing of total loans compared to year end and year end 
growth and mix of loans impacts the overall inherent risk characteristics of the loan portfolio see section loans which discusses credit risks related to the different loan types 
nonperforming loans moved similarly to net charge off activity  representing of total loans at december   down from and at year end and  respectively 
nonperforming loans were million at december  including approximately million acquired from first federal at year end and the addition of a million commercial credit in the food industry during december  down from million at year end and up from million at year end the majority of the improvement in nonperforming loans in compared to year end was attributable to the paydowns or other resolutions on several large problem credits totaling approximately million 
the impact of the sluggish economy on various commercial borrowers was a key contributor to the rise in nonperforming loans for over see table and section nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned for additional details and discussion 
the corporation s process designed to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes an allocation methodology  as well as management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio into criticized loan categories defined as specific loans warranting either specific allocation  or a criticized status of watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
the allocation methodology focuses on evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  changes in the size and character of 
table of contents the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  underlying collateral  historical losses and delinquencies on each portfolio category  and other qualitative and quantitative factors 
because each of the criteria used is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
the allocation of the corporation s allowance for loan losses for the last five years is shown in table the allocation methodology was similar for all years  with a refinement beginning in  whereby the corporation segregated its loss factors allocations used for both criticized and non criticized loans into a component primarily based on historical loss rates and a component primarily based on other qualitative factors that may affect loan collectibility 
management does not believe the refined method produced a significantly different result from the prior year s method 
the following describes the corporation s process for management allocates the allowance for loan losses for credit losses by pools of risk 
first  a valuation allowance estimate is established for specifically identified commercial and commercial real estate loans determined to be impaired by the corporation  using discounted cash flows  estimated fair value of underlying collateral  and or other data available 
second  management allocates allowance for loan losses with loss factors  for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for non criticized loan pools by loan type  primarily based on historical loss rates after considering loan type  historical loss and delinquency experience  and industry statistics 
loans that have been criticized are considered to have greater inherent risk of loss than non criticized loans  as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade  warranting higher loss factors 
the loss factors applied in the methodology are expected to be relatively static year over year but are periodically re evaluated 
between and  loss factors assigned to criticized and non criticized loan pools by type were similar but with reductions made in factors for commercial real estate and residential real estate types to align closer to historical loss levels 
and third  management allocates allowance for loan losses to absorb unrecognized losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to other factors evaluated by management  such as limitations within the credit risk grading process  known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends  industry or other concentrations with current issues that impose higher inherent risks than are reflected in the loss factors  and other relevant considerations 
at december   this third allocation  which was previously noted in table as unallocated  was completely assigned to loan types  as reflected in table at year end  of the allowance for loan losses compared to at year end was allocated to criticized loans  including million of allowance identified for a previously disclosed commercial manufacturing credit million outstanding at december  for which management had doubts concerning the future collectibility of the loan 
the primary shift in the allowance allocation between and was from commercial real estate to commercial  financial  and agricultural 
the amount allocated to commercial real estate loans at year end was million  representing down from at year end of the allowance for loan losses  partly due to applying lower loss factors to this loan type in versus as mentioned earlier 
supporting this lower allocation was a a lesser amount of these loans in criticized categories versus at year end  b lower gross charge offs million compared to million for  and c fewer commercial real estate loans in nonperforming loans compared to at year end 
on the other hand  the allowance allocated to commercial  financial  and agricultural loans was million at year end  representing versus at year end of the allowance for loan losses 
while certain indicators were relatively steady for commercial  financial and agricultural loans  such as minimal change in their percentage of total loans at year end versus or of their percentage of nonperforming loans compared to last year end  and lower gross charge offs  the higher allocation was made given additional loans which are currently not criticized but exhibit concerns to management due to industry issues or the slower than expected improvement in the individual credit relationships 
allowance allocations were higher to residential real estate particularly influenced by the growth of home equity and to installment loans as current economic conditions of rising rates and growing consumer debt carried uncertainties requiring management s judgment as to the impact on individual borrowers 

table of contents the allocation methods used for december  and were comparable 
factors used for criticized loans  as well as for non criticized loan categories  were unchanged between the years 
at both december  and  current economic conditions carried various uncertainties requiring management s judgment as to the impact on the business results of numerous individual borrowers and certain industries 
additionally  the pace at which the financial results of a borrower s company can take a downturn from challenging and varied economic conditions continued to be a factor for both years 
at year end  of the allowance compared to at year end was allocated to criticized loans  including million of allowance identified for a previously disclosed commercial manufacturing credit million outstanding at december  for which management had doubts concerning the future collectibility of the loan 
the primary shift in the allowance allocation was the amount allocated to commercial real estate loans at year end  which was million  representing compared to at year end of the allowance for loan losses 
a greater amount of these loans were in criticized categories versus at year end  charge offs of this loan type increased to million for  more than double between the years  these loans represented of nonperforming loans compared to at year end  and commercial real estate loans grew to represent of total loans at december  compared to at year end 
as noted under the section loans  the credit risk of this loan category is largely influenced by the impact on borrowers of general economic conditions  which have been noted to be challenging and uncertain 
the allowance allocated to commercial  financial  and agricultural loans was million at year end  representing versus at year end of the allowance for loan losses 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans declined since year end  to represent of total loans at december  compared to at december   net charge offs were million down million  and as a percent of nonperforming loans  these loans represented versus at year end 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at december  consolidated net income could be affected if management s estimate of the allowance for loan losses is subsequently materially different  requiring additional or less provision for loan losses to be recorded 
management carefully considers numerous detailed and general factors  its assumptions  and the likelihood of materially different conditions that could alter its assumptions 
while management uses currently available information to recognize losses on loans  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact of such change on the corporation s borrowers 
additionally  the number of large credit relationships over the corporation s million internal hurdle has been increasing over larger credits do not inherently create more risk  but can create wider fluctuations in asset quality measures 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require that certain loan balances be charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned management is committed to an aggressive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy 
this philosophy is implemented through the ongoing monitoring and review of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized 
nonperforming loans are considered one indicator of potential future loan losses 
nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
the corporation specifically excludes from its definition of nonperforming loans student loan balances that are days or more past due and still accruing and that have contractual government guarantees as to collection of principal and interest 
the corporation had approximately million  million  and million at december    and  respectively  of nonperforming student loans 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on nonaccrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past 
table of contents due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed  amortization of related loan fees is suspended  and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible 
if collectibility of the principal is in doubt  payments received are applied to loan principal 
loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in nonperforming loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and are in the process of collection 
also included in nonperforming loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate

the corporation s allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at year end  up from at year end and at year end the improving trend in nonperforming loans was primarily due to decreases in commercial nonperforming loans primarily attributable to the payment or resolution of specific larger commercial credits  despite approximately million in nonperforming loans acquired with first federal at year end and the addition of a million commercial credit in the food industry in late subsequent to year end  the corporation received a substantial paydown on the million food industry commercial credit  reducing the balance outstanding to approximately million as of the end of february commercial nonaccrual loans were million at december  down million from year end  and represented   and of total nonaccrual loans at year end   and  respectively

table of contents for year end versus  the million improvement in commercial nonaccrual loans was predominantly attributable to the paydowns or other resolutions on several large problem credits including resolutions of the two credits totaling million at year end  which at december  one credit was paid in full and the other credit had a remaining outstanding balance of million  net of the addition of a million commercial credit in the food industry see previous paragraph for details on a paydown received subsequent to year end and acquired first federal commercial nonaccrual loans of approximately million at year end 
the million decrease from year end to year end in accruing loans past due days or more was primarily attributable to one large commercial credit million at december   which was subsequently transferred to nonaccrual status 
for year end versus  the million increase in commercial nonaccrual loans was predominantly attributable to the addition  during the second quarter of  of two large commercial credits totaling approximately million at december   one in the construction industry and one in the hospitality industry 
the million increase from year end to year end in accruing loans past due days or more was primarily attributable to one large commercial credit million at december   while the decrease in restructured loans was due to one large commercial credit that was transferred to nonaccrual status and subsequently charged off during other real estate owned decreased to million at december   compared to million and million at year end and  respectively

management actively seeks to ensure properties held are monitored to minimize the corporation s risk of loss 
the following table shows  for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated  the approximate gross interest that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and the amount of interest income that was included in interest income for the period

the decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the corporation expects losses to occur but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans 
the level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in the determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses 
the loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a particular industry but rather cover a diverse range of businesses

short term borrowings increased million  primarily in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
short term borrowings are primarily comprised of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  short term federal home loan bank advances  notes payable to banks  and treasury  tax  and loan notes 
the federal home loan bank advances included in short term borrowings are generally those with original maturities of less than one year 
the treasury  tax  and loan notes are demand notes representing secured borrowings from the us treasury  collateralized by qualifying securities and loans 
this funding program provides funds at the discretion of the us treasury that may be called at any time 
many short term borrowings  particularly federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  are expected to be reissued and  therefore  do not represent an immediate need for cash 
see note  short term borrowings  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on short term borrowings  and table for specific disclosure required for major short term borrowing categories

funds are available from a number of basic banking activity sources  primarily from the core deposit base and from loans and securities repayments and maturities 
additionally  liquidity is provided from sales of the securities portfolio  lines of credit with major banks  the ability to acquire large and brokered deposits  and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale 
the corporation s capital can be a source of funding and liquidity as well 
see section capital 
the corporation s internal liquidity management framework includes measurement of several key elements  such as wholesale funding as a percent of total assets and liquid assets to short term wholesale funding 
strong capital ratios  credit quality  and core earnings are essential to retaining high credit ratings and  consequently  cost effective access to the wholesale funding markets 
a downgrade or loss in credit ratings could have an impact on the corporation s ability to access wholesale funding at favorable interest rates 
as a result  capital ratios  asset quality measurements  and profitability ratios are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the liquidity management process 
at december   the corporation was in compliance with its liquidity objectives 
the corporation s liquidity framework also incorporates contingency planning to assess the nature and volatility of funding sources and to determine alternatives to these sources 
the contingency plan would be activated to ensure the corporation s funding commitments could be met in the event of general market disruption or adverse economic conditions 
while core deposits and loan and investment repayment are principal sources of liquidity  funding diversification is another key element of liquidity management 
diversity is achieved by strategically varying depositor type  term  funding market  and instrument 
as noted below  the parent company and certain subsidiary 
table of contents banks are rated by moody s  standard and poor s s p  and fitch

dividends received in cash from subsidiaries totaled million in at december   million in dividends could be paid to the parent by its subsidiaries without obtaining prior regulatory approval  subject to the capital needs of the banks 
as discussed in item  the subsidiary banks are subject to regulation and  among other things  may be limited in their ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the parent company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available for the payment of cash dividends to the shareholders or for other cash needs 
the parent company also has multiple funding sources that could be used to increase liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility 
these sources include two shelf registrations to issue debt and preferred securities or a combination thereof and  used to a lesser degree  a revolving credit facility and commercial paper issuances 
the parent company has available a million revolving credit facility with established lines of credit from nonaffiliated banks  of which million was available at december  in addition  million of commercial paper was available at december   under the parent company s million commercial paper program 
in may  the parent company filed a shelf registration statement under which the parent company may offer up to million of trust preferred securities 
in may million of trust preferred securities were issued  bearing a fixed coupon rate 
at december   million was available under the trust preferred shelf

in august  the parent company issued million in a subordinated note offering  bearing a fixed coupon rate and year maturity 
at december   million was available under the shelf registration 
investment securities are an important tool to the corporation s liquidity objective 
as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
of the billion investment portfolio  billion were pledged to secure certain deposits  federal home loan bank advances  or for other purposes as required or permitted by law 
the majority of remaining securities could be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity  if necessary 
the bank and thrift subsidiaries have a variety of funding sources in addition to key liquidity sources  such as core deposits  loan and investment portfolio repayments and maturities  and loan and investment portfolio sales available to increase financial flexibility 
a billion bank note program associated with associated bank  national association  was established during under this program  short term and long term debt may be issued 
as of december   million of long term bank notes and million of short term bank notes were outstanding 
the banks have also established federal funds lines with major banks and the ability to borrow from the federal home loan bank billion was outstanding at december  
in addition  the bank subsidiaries also issue institutional certificates of deposit  from time to time offer brokered certificates of deposit  and to a lesser degree  accept eurodollar deposits 

table of contents as reflected in table  the corporation has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and other commitments  which may require future cash payments 
shorter maturities of time deposits seen in table could imply near term liquidity risk if such deposit balances do not rollover at maturity into new time or non time deposits at the corporation 
however  the relatively shorter maturities in time deposits are not out of the ordinary to the corporation s experience of its customer base preference and there has been growth in deposits 
continued strategic emphasis on deposit growth should further support this liquidity source 
many short term borrowings  particularly federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  are expected to be reissued and  therefore  do not represent an immediate need for cash 
the corporation has been purposely extending its long term funding sources primarily to take advantage of extending maturities in the lower rate environment 
while this commits the corporation contractually to future cash payments  it is supportive of interest rate risk and liquidity management strategies 
as a financial services provider  the corporation routinely enters into commitments to extend credit 
while contractual obligations represent future cash requirements of the corporation  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
for the year ended december   net cash provided from operating and financing activities was million and million  respectively  while investing activities used net cash of billion  for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million since year end in general  net asset growth since year end was strong  primarily due to the first federal acquisition  as well as organic growth 
therefore  various funding sources were utilized to support the net asset growth  particularly deposits  short term borrowings  and long term funding 
these funding sources partially financed the first federal and jabas acquisitions  provided for the repayment of short term borrowings and long term funding  common stock repurchases  and the payment of cash dividends to the corporation s shareholders 
for the year ended december   net cash provided from operating and financing activities was million and million  respectively  while investing activities used net cash of million  for a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million since year end generally  during  deposit growth was strong  while net asset growth since year end was moderate up 
thus  the reliance on other funding sources was reduced  particularly short term borrowings and long term debt 
the deposit growth provided for the repayment of short term borrowings and long term debt  common stock repurchases  and the payment of cash dividends to the corporation s shareholders 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
the corporation faces market risk in the form of interest rate risk through other than trading activities 
market risk from other than trading activities in the form of interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods 
the corporation uses financial modeling techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk 
policies established by the corporation s asset liability committee and approved by the board of directors limit exposure of earnings at risk 
general interest rate movements are used to develop sensitivity as the corporation feels it has no primary exposure to a specific point on the yield curve 
these limits are based on the corporation s exposure to a bp and bp immediate and sustained parallel rate move  either upward or downward 
interest rate risk in order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates  the corporation uses three different measurement tools static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and economic value of equity 
these three measurement tools represent static ie  point in time measures that do not take into account subsequent interest rate changes  changes in management strategies and market conditions  and future production of assets or liabilities  among other factors 
static gap analysis the static gap analysis starts with contractual repricing information for assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
these items are then combined with repricing estimations for administered 
table of contents rate interest bearing demand deposits  savings  and money market accounts and non rate related products demand deposit accounts  other assets  and other liabilities to create a baseline repricing balance sheet 
in addition to the contractual information  residential mortgage whole loan products and mortgage backed securities are adjusted based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds that capture the expected prepayment of principal above the contractual amount based on how far away the contractual coupon is from market coupon rates 
the following table represents the corporation s consolidated static gap position as of december  table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  interest sensitivity period total within days days days year over year total in thousands earning assets loans held for sale investment securities  at fair value loans interest rate swaps other earning assets total earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits other interest bearing liabilities interest rate swaps total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap month cumulative gap as a percentage of earning assets at december  the interest rate sensitivity assumptions for demand deposits  savings accounts  money market accounts  and interest bearing demand deposit accounts are based on current and historical experiences regarding portfolio retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
based on these experiences  a portion of these balances is considered to be long term and fairly stable and is  therefore  included in the over year category 
for analysis purposes  brokered cds of million have been included with other interest bearing liabilities and excluded from interest bearing deposits 
interest rate swaps on funding are presented on a net basis 
the static gap analysis in table provides a representation of the corporation s earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
it is a static indicator that does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not necessarily indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
as of december   the month cumulative gap results were within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 
at the end of  the corporation s balance sheet was asset sensitive to interest rate movements 
asset sensitive means that assets will reprice faster than liabilities 
in a rising rate environment  an asset sensitive bank will generally benefit 
during  the corporation remained asset sensitive as a result of issuing long term funding  growth in demand deposits  and shortening of the mortgage portfolio and investment portfolio due to faster prepayment experience 
however  the flattening of the yield curve and competitive pricing pressures substantially offset the benefits to net interest income from the interest rate increases that occurred during the second half of for  the corporation is positioned to benefit from rising rates  assuming 
table of contents anticipated increases by the federal reserve and a steepening of the yield curve 
see also section net interest income 
interest rate risk of embedded positions including prepayment and early withdrawal options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  and cap and floor options within products require a more dynamic measuring tool to capture earnings risk 
earnings simulation and economic value of equity are used to more completely assess interest rate risk 
simulation of earnings along with the static gap analysis  determining the sensitivity of short term future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus bp and bp parallel rate shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling 
in addition to the assumptions used to create the static gap  simulation of earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity 
future business assumptions involving administered rate products  prepayments for future rate sensitive balances  and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included 
these items are then modeled to project net interest income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates 
the resulting net interest income for the next month period is compared to the net interest income amount calculated using flat rates 
this difference represents the corporation s earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus bp parallel rate shock 
the resulting simulations for december   projected that net interest income would increase by approximately of budgeted net interest income if rates rose by a bp shock  and projected that the net interest income would decrease by approximately if rates fell by a bp shock 
at december   the bp shock up was projected to increase budgeted net interest income by approximately  and the bp shock down was projected to decrease budgeted net interest income by approximately 
as of december   the simulation of earnings results was within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 
economic value of equity economic value of equity is another tool used to measure the impact of interest rates on the present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
this measurement is a longer term analysis of interest rate risk as it evaluates every cash flow produced by the current balance sheet 
these results are based solely on immediate and sustained parallel changes in market rates and do not reflect the earnings sensitivity that may arise from other factors 
these factors may include changes in the shape of the yield curve  the change in spread between key market rates  or accounting recognition of the impairment of certain intangibles 
the above results are also considered to be conservative estimates due to the fact that no management action to mitigate potential income variances is included within the simulation process 
this action could include  but would not be limited to  delaying an increase in deposit rates  extending liabilities  using financial derivative products to hedge interest rate risk  changing the pricing characteristics of loans  or changing the growth rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the projected changes for earnings simulation and economic value of equity for both and were within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 
the corporation uses interest rate derivative financial instruments as an asset liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposure indicated by the net interest income simulation described above 
they are used to modify the corporation s exposures to interest rate fluctuations and provide more stable spreads between loan yields and the rate on their funding sources 
derivative financial instruments are also discussed in note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the corporation entered into million in notional amounts of new interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
not included in the table below were customer swaps and caps with a notional amount of million as of december   for which the corporation has mirror swaps and caps 
the change in fair value of these customer swaps and caps is recorded in earnings 
the net impact of these swaps and caps for was immaterial

counterparties to these interest cap agreements pay the corporation based on the notional amount and the difference between current rates and strike rates 
at december   there were million of interest rate caps outstanding  which have a six month libor strike of 
to hedge against falling interest rates  the corporation may use interest rate floors

table summarizes significant contractual obligations and other commitments at december   at those amounts contractually due to the recipient  not including any interest  unamortized premiums or discounts  hedge basis adjustments  or other similar carrying value adjustments

the corporation may have a variety of financial transactions that  under generally accepted accounting principles  are either not recorded on the balance sheet or are recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that differ from the full contract or notional amounts 
the corporation s derivative contracts  under which the corporation is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates applied to notional amounts  are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the contracts changes daily as market interest rates change 
because neither the derivative assets and 
table of contents liabilities  nor their notional amounts  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  they are not included in the table for further information and discussion of derivative contracts  see section interest rate risk  and table  and note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation does not have significant off balance sheet arrangements such as the use of special purpose entities or securitization trusts 
related to the million commitments to originate residential mortgage loans in table  the corporation had outstanding forward commitments to sell million of loans to various investors as of december   both of which are derivatives see note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements

any fractional shares resulting from the dividend were paid in cash 
stockholders equity at december   increased million to billion  or per share compared with per share at the end of book value per share increased at year end  primarily due to recording the shares issued in the first federal transaction at market value  as prescribed by the purchase accounting method 
stockholders equity is also described in note  stockholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the corporation continues to be positioned to benefit from rising rates  though the flattening of the yield curve and competitive pressures substantially offset benefits to taxable equivalent net interest income from the interest rate increases that occurred in average earning assets increased to billion  up billion  including a billion increase in average loans and a billion increase in average securities and short term investments between the fourth quarter periods

to better understand the impact of acquiring first federal  taxable equivalent net interest income for fourth quarter excluding first federal was approximately million  or million higher than the comparable quarter in average earning assets excluding first federal grew approximately billion  with loans increasing billion and securities and short term investments increasing billion  as the corporation employed leveraging in early to increase overall earning assets 
total average deposits excluding first federal grew approximately billion over the comparable quarter in  funding of the loan growth 
the remainder of the growth in earning assets was funded predominantly by wholesale borrowings up approximately billion 
the federal reserve raised rates by bp five times since mid year  resulting in an average federal funds rate for fourth quarter of  bp higher than fourth quarter for fourth quarter  the net interest margin was  down bp compared to fourth quarter  the net result of an bp lower interest rate spread and a bp higher contribution from net free funds 
the yield on earning assets for fourth quarter was or bp higher than fourth quarter  primarily attributable to higher loan yields up bp though offset partly by lower securities yields down bp  particularly impacted by the flatter yield curve during 
the rate on interest bearing liabilities was up bp  with the cost of funds repricing upward in the rising rate environment 
interest bearing deposits cost bp more  and wholesale funding cost bp more than the comparable quarter of  comprised of short term borrowings up bp and long term funding down bp between comparable fourth quarter periods

noninterest income in fourth quarter was million up million or over fourth quarter  which included the acquisitions of jabas and first federal 
primary increases were seen in retail commissions up million  service charges on deposits up million  and credit card and other nondeposit fees up million  while primary decreases occurred in net mortgage banking income down million and boli income down million 
retail commission income benefited from both the acquisitions and organic growth  with insurance commissions up million and fixed annuities income up million 
both service charges on deposits and credit card and other nondeposit fees benefited from the additional first federal account volumes  as well as from mid fee increases related to deposit service charges and nonsufficient funds  increased pricing on nondeposit retail and commercial service charges  and higher insurance related advisory fees 
gross mortgage banking income was up million  with million higher servicing fees particularly given the addition of first federal s billion servicing portfolio  and million increased gains on sale and other income 
mortgage servicing rights expense  however  rose million  with million more base amortization on the larger mortgage servicing rights asset  and an addition to the valuation reserve in fourth quarter of million versus a recovery to the valuation reserve in fourth quarter of million 
thus  net mortgage banking income was down million between fourth quarter periods 
boli income was down due to the mid year repricing of a large investment of boli 
noninterest expense for fourth quarter was million up million or over fourth quarter  which reflects the inclusion of the acquisitions of jabas and first federal 
personnel expense was up million and all remaining noninterest expenses increased million collectively 
to isolate the impact of first federal  personnel expense excluding first federal was unchanged between comparable quarters and all other noninterest expenses excluding first federal were down million  particularly given controlled discretionary spending efforts of the corporation during income tax expense was up million between the fourth quarters  with approximately million due to higher net income before taxes and approximately million due to a higher effective tax rate
