item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial position and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes and the supplemental oil and natural gas disclosures included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements relating to our plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions  and resources 
the words anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  should and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those stated in the forward looking statements 
we do not undertake to update  revise or correct any of the forward looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws 
readers are cautioned that such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the headings special note regarding forward looking statements beginning on page and factors that may affect future results and financial condition beginning on page overview we engage in the acquisition  development  exploitation  exploration  and production of onshore north american oil and natural gas reserves 
our business strategies include maintaining an active low risk development drilling program  maximizing existing reserves and production through high pressure air injection projects  expanding our reserves  production and drilling inventory through a disciplined acquisition program  exploring for reserves and operating in a cost effective  efficient  and safe manner 

table of contents our financial results and ability to generate cash depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and natural gas 
commodity prices strengthened considerably in the average oil price for the nymex futures market was per barrel for as compared to per barrel for the average natural gas price for the nymex futures market was per mmbtu for as compared to per mmbtu for commodity prices are influenced by many factors that are outside of our control 
we cannot predict future commodity prices 
for this reason  we attempt to mitigate the effect of commodity price risk by hedging a portion of our future production 
in  we saw the industry and commodity markets begin to reflect a higher long term outlook for commodity prices 
as a result during the year  the industry continued to bid up the price of reserves to historically high levels 
however  we were fortunate to be able to expand our core areas with the purchase of cortez oil gas  inc and natural gas properties in the overton field 
as the year progressed and the cost of acquisitions continued to rise  we began to identify exploration projects within our core areas that complemented our current asset portfolio 
we believe the rate of return on our exploration projects will meet or exceed the rate of return available in the current acquisition market 
we will  however  continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they arise and to the extent we believe we can expect to realize a good rate of return to our shareholders 
we continue to believe that a portfolio of long lived quality assets will position the company for future success  and that reserve replacement is a key statistical measure of our success in growing our asset base 
during  we replaced of our production 
our development program replaced of production and acquisitions replaced of production 
see business and properties general oil and natural gas production and reserves on page for the calculation of our reserve replacement ratios 
also in  we continued to see positive results from our phase i high pressure air injection project at the pennel unit 
pennel is the largest unit of the cca units 
the phase ii implementation is anticipated to be complete by the end of and initial air injection is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of in the little beaver unit at the southern end of the cca  we have completed the implementation of phase i and ii hpai projects 
our independent reserve engineers  miller and lents  ltd 
estimated that we added million and million barrels  respectively  of proved undeveloped oil reserves associated with our high pressure air injection program at the end of and for the long term  we believe that high pressure air injection technology can be applied throughout the cedar creek anticline 
highlights our financial and operating results for the year ended december  include the following oil and natural gas reserves increased to mmboe 
during  we added mmboe  replacing of the mmboe produced in see business and properties general oil and natural gas production and reserves on page for the calculation of our reserve replacement ratio 
oil reserves accounted for of total proved reserves  and of proved reserves are developed 
the estimated pretax present value of our reserves increased by to over billion using a discount rate and constant year end prices of for oil and for natural gas 
the standardized measure at december  is billion 
standardized measure differs from pv by million  because standardized measure includes the effect of asset retirement obligations and future income taxes 
production volumes for increased to mmboe  boe per day compared with production of mmboe  boe per day 
oil represented and of our total production in and  respectively 
the increase in production is due to our continued successful development and exploitation program as well as acquisitions 
net income for increased to million  or per diluted share  on revenues of million 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share  on revenues of million 
for  cash flow from operations increased to million 
table of contents from million in cash flow from operations in the increase in net income and cash flow from operations in was primarily a result of higher production and higher commodity prices throughout the year 
we invested million in development  exploitation  and exploration projects during  including million in our high pressure air injection projects in the little beaver unit and the pennel unit of the cca 
in  we drilled gross operated productive wells and gross non operated productive wells  for a total of gross productive wells for the year 
on a net basis  we drilled operated productive wells and participated in non operated productive wells in out of the net operated productive wells  net wells were service wells 
we also drilled net non productive wells in  of which net were exploratory wells 
we acquired natural gas producing properties and undeveloped leases in the overton field located in smith county  texas  additional interests in elm grove field  and all of the capital stock of cortez oil gas  inc on april   we issued and sold million of senior subordinated notes due april  we received approximately million after paying all costs associated with the offering 
the net proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of cortez and repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
on june   we issued and sold  shares of our common stock to the public at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering  after underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses  were million 
we used the net proceeds of this offering to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
on june   we filed a new universal shelf registration statement on form s with the sec 
the registration statement  which was declared effective by the sec on july   allows us to issue an aggregate of million of common stock  preferred stock  senior debt and subordinated debt 
on august   we improved our financial flexibility and liquidity by amending and restating our credit facility and increasing our borrowing base from million to million 
at december   we had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  million in outstanding letters of credit  and million available 
results of operations comparison of to set forth below is our comparison of our results of operations for the year ended december  with our results of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents revenues and production 
the following table illustrates the primary components of oil and natural gas revenue for the years ended december  and  as well as each year s respective oil and natural gas volumes dollars in thousands except per unit amounts year ended december  difference revenue unit revenue unit revenue unit revenues oil wellhead oil hedges total oil revenues natural gas wellhead natural gas hedges total natural gas revenues combined wellhead combined hedges total combined revenues average average average nymex nymex nymex production unit production unit production unit other data oil mbbls natural gas mmcf combined mboe oil revenues increased million to million in over as production increased mbbls and our average realized price increased per bbl 
oil revenues were reduced by million in due to our hedging program 
the per bbl reduction to our wellhead oil price due to hedging represented a per bbl greater reduction than in the increase in oil production resulted from success through our drilling program  uplift from our hpai program  and acquisitions 
in addition  our oil wellhead revenue was reduced by million and million in and  respectively  for the net profits interests payments related to our cca properties 
natural gas revenues increased in by million to million due to increased production of  mmcf and an increase in the net wellhead price received 
the increase in net wellhead price received of per mcf resulted as the average nymex price increased per mcf over the same period 
the increase in natural gas production resulted from success through our drilling program and acquisitions 
for the full year  production is expected to increase to from levels primarily due to our capital budget of million and the full year effect of our acquisitions 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production are largely based on current market prices  which are beyond our control 
for comparability and accountability  we take a constant approach to budgeting commodity prices 
we presently analyze our inventory of capital projects on per bbl and per mcf nymex prices 
we do not assume any escalation of commodity prices when preparing our capital budget 
if nymex prices trend downward below our base deck  we may reevaluate our capital projects 
at these assumed prices  we have forecasted net hedge contract payments of approximately million for oil and million for natural gas during however  these amounts will change directly with any change in the market price of oil and natural gas and with any change in our outstanding hedge positions 
additionally  we have anticipated net profits interests payments in of million for 
table of contents oil and million for natural gas 
these payments are highly dependent on the level of drilling in the cca and on commodity prices  and thus  any change in the level of drilling or fluctuation in commodity prices will have a direct impact on the amount of payments we are required to make 
if commodity prices are significantly lower than our forecasted prices of for oil and for natural gas  it could have a material effect on our projected results 
in this case  we would have to borrow additional money under our existing revolving credit facility  attempt to access the capital markets  or curtail the capital program 
if drilling is curtailed or ended  future cash flows could be materially negatively impacted 
in addition to the possibility of a general market decline in oil and natural gas prices  a widening of the difference between the price we are paid and nymex prices  which we refer to as the differential  could have a material negative impact on our revenues 
due to a combination of higher prices and increased competition with foreign grades from both canada and the middle east  our differential to nymex oil widened in the second half of early differentials to nymex oil also indicate a further widening 
we expect our oil differential in to remain wider than expenses 
the following table summarizes our expenses for the years ended december  and year ended december  difference expenses in thousands lease operations production  ad valorem  and severance taxes depletion  depreciation  and amortization exploration general and administrative excluding non cash stock based compensation non cash stock based compensation derivative fair value gain loss other operating interest current and deferred income tax provision expenses per boe lease operations production  ad valorem  and severance taxes depletion  depreciation  and amortization exploration general and administrative excluding non cash stock based compensation non cash stock based compensation derivative fair value gain loss other operating interest current and deferred income tax provision lease operations expense 
lease operations expense increased by million in as compared to the increase in total lease operations expense resulted from an increase in production volumes as a result of our drilling program  the elm grove  cortez and overton acquisitions and our hpai program  as well as an increase in the per boe rate 
the increase in our average per boe rate was attributable to acquired properties with higher per boe expenses and an increase in prices paid for outside services 

table of contents for  we anticipate an increase in total lease operations expense on both an aggregate and a per boe basis 
we anticipate the overall increase due to a full year of production at our cortez and overton properties  as well as further implementation of the high pressure air injection program 
currently  we are capitalizing the hpai costs on the little beaver hpai project  which will continue until the reservoir becomes fully pressurized 
we expect the reservoir to become fully pressurized in and will begin expensing the costs of injecting air at that time 
we have projected lease operations expense of per boe for as compared to for production  ad valorem  and severance taxes 
production  ad valorem and severance taxes increased by million in as compared to the increase in production  ad valorem  and severance taxes is a direct result of the increase in wellhead revenue 
see revenues and production above 
as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of hedges  production  ad valorem  and severance taxes decreased slightly from to from to for  total production  ad valorem  and severance taxes will depend in a large part on prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
however  the production  ad valorem  and severance tax rate should remain relatively flat at of wellhead revenues before hedging 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a expense 
dd a expense increased by million in as compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in production as well as a increase in the per boe rate 
this rate increase was due to the acquisition of the overton and cortez properties  which had higher acquisition costs than our historical average  as well as higher drilling costs per boe of reserves than our historical dd a rate in certain areas 
we anticipate the total dd a expense in will increase due to increased production and our planned capital expenditures of million 
we expect the invested capital to add barrels through the drill bit in at a cost higher than our historical dd a rate 
assuming capital expenditures do not differ significantly from our budgeted amount  we expect our dd a rate for to be approximately per boe 
this rate could vary significantly based on actual capital expenditures  production rates  net profits interests  and any acquisitions that close in additionally  changes in the market price for oil and natural gas could affect the level of our reserves 
as the level of reserves change  the dd a rate is inversely affected 
exploration expense 
exploration costs increased in as we began a drilling exploration program in as previously discussed  we drilled a record number of wells in  several of which were exploratory wells 
we drilled net non productive exploratory wells at a cost of million 
this compares to when zero non productive exploratory wells were drilled 
three of the exploratory dry holes were drilled in our montana shallow gas area and one was drilled in the barnett shale in our mid continent area 
in addition to the increase in dry hole expense  additional exploration related expenses were incurred in related to our exploration projects 
we incurred abandonment and impairment of undeveloped leases costs of million  delay rental expense of million  seismic costs of million  and other geological and geophysical expenses of million 
for  we expect exploration expense to be approximately million as we continue our current exploration projects in the mid continent and montana shallow gas area 
this amount could vary considerably  however  based on the success of these projects 
general and administrative g a expense 
g a expense increased by million in over the increase in g a expense was a result of increased staffing levels used to manage our growing asset base and outside consulting services used in the evaluation of potential acquisitions and costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of we have forecast approximately million for general and administrative expenses in as compared to the million incurred in the increase from is expected to result from increased staffing to manage our larger asset base  additional expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and higher directors and officers insurance costs 
additionally  we have 
table of contents experienced increased competition for human resources from other companies within the industry that has increased the cost to hire and retain experienced industry personnel 
non cash stock based compensation expense 
non cash stock based compensation expense increased from million in to million in this expense represents the amortization of deferred compensation recorded in equity related to restricted stock granted under the incentive stock plan 
this amount is being amortized to expense over the vesting period of the restricted stock 
during the years ended december    and  we issued   and  shares  respectively  of restricted stock to employees which depend only on continued employment for vesting 
the following table illustrates by year of grant the vesting of shares which remain outstanding at december  year of vesting year of grant total total during the years ended december    and  we issued  zero  and  shares of restricted stock to employees that not only depend on the passage of time and continued employment  but also on certain performance measures for their vesting 
the following table illustrates by year of grant the vesting of shares which remain outstanding at december  year of vesting year of grant total total deferred compensation of million was reclassified within equity from additional paid in capital during the year ended december  in conjunction with the grants  and will be expensed over the related periods from the grant dates to the vesting dates 
subsequent to december   we issued  shares of restricted stock to our employees as part of our annual incentive program 
we have projected non cash stock based compensation expense related to our restricted stock to be million 
this amount is dependent somewhat on fluctuations in our stock price because  as noted above  certain awards are accounted for as variable awards as they are based on achievement of certain performance measures 
derivative fair value gain loss 
the derivative fair value loss of million in represents the ineffective portion of the mark to market loss on our derivative hedging instruments  settlements received on our fixed to floating interest rate swap  gains losses related to commodity derivatives not designated as hedges  and changes in the mark to market value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap 
in conjunction with the issuance of notes in june  we entered into an interest rate swap  which swaps fixed rates to floating  with the intent of lowering our effective interest payments 
as this transaction does not qualify for hedge accounting  changes in its fair market value  as well as settlements  are not recorded in interest expense  but in derivative fair value gain loss on the consolidated statements of operations 
during  a gain of million related to this interest rate swap was recorded in derivative fair value gain loss

other operating expense 
other operating expense increased million in as compared to the increase in other operating expense is primarily attributable to million increase in oil and natural gas transportation expense  million increase in loss on sale of properties and million increase in annual corporate taxes  offset by million decrease in severance payments to former employees 
for  we anticipate other operating expense to be approximately million as compared to million in  which reflects the increased transportation costs associated with higher expected production volumes 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million over due primarily to an increase in debt outstanding under our credit facility and the new notes  offset slightly by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate from period to period 
we incurred additional debt in to fund the cortez and overton acquisitions 
the weighted average interest rate  net of hedges  for was compared to for this lower weighted average interest rate is the result of the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes in april the following table illustrates the components of interest expense for and in thousands difference senior subordinated notes senior subordinated notes revolving credit facility hedge loss amortization debt issuance cost amortization fees and other total income tax expense

description of critical accounting estimates oil and natural gas properties successful efforts method 
we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all costs associated with productive and nonproductive development wells are capitalized 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
costs associated with exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending determination of whether the well is economically productive or nonproductive 
all capitalized costs associated with both development and exploratory wells are shown as development of oil and natural gas properties in the investing activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
if an exploratory well does not find reserves or does not find reserves in a sufficient quantity as to make them economically producible  the previously capitalized costs are expensed in the consolidated statement of operations and shown as a non cash adjustment to net income in the operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows in the period in which the determination was made 
if a determination cannot be made within one year of the exploration well being drilled and no other drilling or exploration activities to evaluate the discovery are firmly planned  all previously capitalized costs associated with the exploratory well are expensed and shown as a non cash adjustment to net income at that time 
expenditures for redrilling or directional drilling in a previously abandoned well are classified as drilling costs to a proven or unproven reservoir for determination of capital or expense 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance to sustain or increase production from the existing producing reservoir are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures to recomplete a current well in a different or additional proven or unproven reservoir are capitalized pending determination that economic reserves have been added 
if the recompletion is not successful  the expenditures are charged to expense 
significant tangible equipment added or replaced is capitalized 
expenditures to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reserves are capitalized 
internal costs directly associated with the development and exploitation of properties are capitalized as a cost of the property and are classified accordingly in our consolidated financial statements 
capitalized costs are amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves or proved reserves  as applicable 
natural gas volumes are converted to equivalent barrels of oil at the rate of six mcf to one barrel 
see note new accounting standards  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which we adopted as of january  
table of contents unproved properties 
we adhere to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties 
the greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs 
the costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated as to recoverability  based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management 
we consider a combination of time and geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs 
unproved properties had a net book value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we recorded a charge for unproved acreage impairment in the amount of million  million  and zero in   and  respectively 
oil and natural gas reserves 
assumptions used by the independent reserve engineers in calculating reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
future prices received for production and future production costs may vary  perhaps significantly  from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of calculating reserve estimates 
we may not be able to develop proved reserves within the periods estimated 
furthermore  prices and costs will not remain constant 
actual production may not equal the estimated amounts used in the preparation of reserve projections 
as these estimates change  the amount of calculated reserves change 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
impairment 
impairments of proved oil and natural gas properties are directly affected by our reserve estimates 
we are required to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties and other long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset s carrying value to its undiscounted expected future net cash flows  then it is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of management judgment  including the determination of property s reserves  amount and timing of future cash flows  and fair value 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a 
dd a expense is directly affected by our reserve estimates 
any change in reserves directly impacts the amount of dd a expense that we recognize in a given period 
assuming no other changes  such as an increase in depreciable base  as our reserves increase  the amount of dd a expense in a given period decreases and vice versa 
changes in future commodity prices would likely result in increases or decreases in estimated recoverable reserves 
additionally  miller lents  ltd  our independent reserve engineers  estimate our reserves once a year at december goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the purchase of cortez oil gas  inc in april see note  acquisitions 
we test goodwill for impairment quarterly by applying a fair value based test 
we would recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we tested goodwill for impairment and used discounted cash flows to establish fair values for the company as a whole 
the test indicated no impairment for net profits interests a major portion of our acreage position in the cedar creek anticline is subject to net profits interests npi ranging from to 
the holders of these net profits interests are entitled to receive a fixed percentage of the cash flow remaining after specified costs have been deducted from net revenue 
the net profits calculations are contractually defined  but in general  net profits are determined after considering operating expense  overhead expense  interest expense  and drilling costs 
the amounts of reserves and production calculated to be attributable to these net profits interests are deducted from our reserves and production data  and our revenues are reported net of npi payments 
the reserves and production that are attributed to the npis are calculated by dividing estimated future npi payments in the case of reserves 
table of contents or prior period actual npi payments in the case of production by the commodity prices current at the determination date 
fluctuations in commodity prices and the levels of development activities in the cca from period to period will impact the reserves and production attributed to the npis and will have an inverse effect on our reported reserves and production 
based largely on higher commodity prices  we expect to make higher net profit interest payments in and possibly beyond than we have in previous years  which directly impacts our revenues  production  reserves  and net income 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized for our share of jointly owned properties as oil and natural gas is produced and sold  net of royalties and net profits interest payments 
natural gas revenues are also reduced by any processing and other fees paid except for transportation costs paid to third parties which are recorded as expense 
natural gas revenue is recorded using the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized as natural gas is sold rather than as it is produced 
royalties  net profits interests  and severance taxes are paid based upon the actual price received from the sales 
to the extent actual quantities and values of oil and natural gas are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties  we estimate and record the expected sales volumes and price for those properties 
we also do not recognize revenue for the production in tanks or pipelines that has not been delivered to the purchaser yet 
our net oil inventories in pipelines were  bbls and  bbls at december  and  respectively 
natural gas imbalances under delivered to us at december  and december   were  mmbtu and  mmbtu  respectively 
income taxes section credits 
section of the internal revenue code the code allows a percent tax credit for certain enhanced oil recovery project costs incurred in the united states 
we believe project costs incurred related to our hpai tertiary recovery project on the cca qualify under the provisions of the code and  therefore  we have reduced income tax expense by percent of project costs incurred to date 
the tax basis for the properties and related intangible drilling cost deductions and future depreciation deductions is reduced by the amount of the enhanced oil recovery tax credit 
in order to qualify for the credits a project must meet all of the following requirements the project involves the application of one or more qualified tertiary recovery methods that is reasonably expected to result in more than an insignificant increase in the amount of crude oil that ultimately will be recovered  the project is located within the united states  the first injection of liquids  gases  or other matter for the project occurs after december   and the project is certified by a petroleum engineer 
according to the code  the costs that will qualify for the credit when paid or incurred in connection with a qualifying enhanced oil recovery project include tangible property 
any amount paid for tangible property that is an integral part of a qualified enhanced oil recovery project  and with respect to which depreciation is allowable 
intangible drilling and development costs 
intangible drilling cost with respect to which the taxpayer may make an intangible drilling costs deduction election under code sec

qualified tertiary injectant expenses 
any qualified tertiary injectant expenses for which a deduction is allowable under any code section 
if our federal income tax returns are reviewed by the internal revenue service the irs  the irs could disagree with our decision and disallow a portion of the credit 
while we believe our hpai project qualifies for the tax credit and that our accounting and tracking of the costs related to the project are 
table of contents accurate  should the irs disagree with our position  we would be required to record additional income tax expense to the extent income tax expense has previously been reduced related to the generation of section credits 
effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate is subject to variability from period to period as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates and or changes in tax laws which can affect tax paying companies 
currently  our effective tax rate varies primarily as the amount of section income tax credits generated varies from period to period 
these credits are generated by paying or incurring certain costs in connection with a qualifying enhanced oil recovery project  such as our current high pressure air injection projects underway in the cca 
our effective tax rate is also affected by changes in the allocation of property  payroll  and revenues between states in which we own property as rates vary from state to state 
stock based compensation employee stock options and restricted stock awards are accounted for under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  no compensation is recorded for stock options that are granted to employees or non employee directors with an exercise price equal to or above the common stock price on the grant date 
if compensation expense for the stock based awards had been determined using the provisions of sfas  our net income and net income per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  as reported non cash stock based compensation net of taxes net income basic net income per share diluted net income per share pro forma non cash stock based compensation net of taxes net income basic net income per share diluted net income per share during the year ended december    employee stock options and  shares of restricted stock that were issued and outstanding at december  were forfeited 
hedging and related activities we use various financial instruments for non trading purposes to manage and reduce price volatility and other market risks associated with our crude oil and natural gas production 
these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to commodity price decreases  but they can also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from commodity price increases 
our risk management activity is generally accomplished through over the counter forward derivative contracts executed with large financial institutions 
we also use derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps  which hedge our risk related to interest rate fluctuation 
we currently recognize all of our derivative and hedging instruments in our statements of financial position as either assets or liabilities and measure them at fair value 
if a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting  it must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
however  if a derivative does qualify for hedge accounting  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value can be offset against the 
table of contents change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  the cash flows from the hedging instrument must be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows due to changes in the underlying items being hedged 
in addition  all hedging relationships must be designated  documented  and reassessed periodically 
most of our derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
cash flow hedges are marked to market through comprehensive income each quarter 
currently  all of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
these instruments hedge the exposure of variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk 
the effective portion of the mark to market gain or loss on these derivative instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized as derivative fair value gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations immediately 
while management does not anticipate changing the designation of any of our current derivative contracts as hedges  factors beyond our control can preclude the use of hedge accounting 
one example would be variability in the nymex price for oil or natural gas  upon which many of our commodity derivative contracts are based  that does not coincide with changes in the spot price for oil and natural gas that we are paid 
another example would be if the counterparty to a derivative contract was deemed no longer creditworthy and non performance under the terms of the contract was likely 
to the extent our derivative contracts are not designated as hedges  high earnings volatility can result  as any future changes in the market value of the contract would then be marked to market through earnings 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb sfas r requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see stock based compensation above for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for fiscal through fiscal  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards

we do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents capital resources  capital commitments  and liquidity capital resources and capital commitments our primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing activities 
our primary needs for cash are as follows development  exploitation  and exploration of our existing oil and natural gas properties high pressure air injection programs on our cca properties acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties leasehold and acreage costs other general property and equipment funding of necessary working capital payment of contractual obligations for  our board of directors has approved the following million capital budget  excluding potential proved property acquisitions in thousands budgeted capital expenditures development  exploitation  and exploration hpai leasehold and acreage acquisition other pp e total we analyze our inventory of capital projects based on per bbl and per mcf nymex prices 
we do not assume any escalation of commodity prices when preparing our capital budget 
if nymex prices trend downward below our base deck  we may reevaluate capital projects and may adjust the capital budgeted for development  exploitation  and exploration investments accordingly 
development  exploitation  and exploration 
our capital expenditures for development  exploitation  and exploration during the years ended december    and were as follows in thousands year ended december  development  exploitation  and exploration expenditures development and exploitation hpai exploration total for  we expect to invest million in development  exploitation  and exploration projects 
high pressure air injection 
in  we began implementing our second hpai program in the little beaver unit of the cca and began injecting air in the reservoir in december at little beaver  we completed the implementation of phase i and phase ii during the reservoir is pressuring up in line with forecasts and we expect to see initial production uplift mid year in we began phase i of little beaver unit of cca spending million in development capital 

table of contents for  we have budgeted million for high pressure air injection capital  primarily related to our pennel program 
acquisitions  leasehold and acreage costs 
our capital expenditures for oil and natural gas proved property acquisitions during the years ended december    and were as follows in thousands year ended december  acquisitions  leasehold and acreage costs acquisitions leasehold and acreage costs total in  we completed the cortez and overton acquisitions 
in  we completed an acquisition of interests in natural gas properties in the elm grove field in north louisiana 
in  we completed the central permian acquisition from conoco for approximately million  and a second  follow on acquisition of additional working interest for million 
also in  we acquired an interest in oil and natural gas properties in southeast utah s paradox basin 
we do not budget for acquisitions but we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they arise in with the same disciplined commitment to acquire assets that fit our portfolio and continue to create value 
we will continue to pursue acquisitions of properties with similar upside potential to our current producing properties portfolio 
because of the current high oil price environment  acquiring good quality oil and natural gas properties that are predictable  exploitable  and profitable is increasingly difficult 
success in the acquisition market depends largely on the level of competition in the marketplace and the availability of properties for sale 
our current million capital budget for does not include any funds for the development and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties that we may acquire during our practice is to review our capital budget following a significant acquisition 
our capital expenditures for leasehold and acreage costs during the years ended december    and totaled million and million  million  respectively 
leasehold costs incurred in are higher than in the past primarily because of the cortez  overton  and montana shallow gas acreage acquisitions during the year 
of the million of capital expenditures for unproved property in  million and million relate to the cortez and overton acquisitions respectively  million relates to leases acquired in our montana shallow gas area  and the remaining million relates to unproved acreage spread over our other core areas 
for  we expect to invest million for the acquisition of leasehold and acreage costs primarily in our core areas 
other general property and equipment 
our capital expenditures for other general property and equipment during the years ended december    and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for other general property and equipment include aircraft  corporate leasehold improvements  computers  and various equipment 
for  we expect to invest million in other general property and equipment 
working capital 
at december   our working capital was million while at december  working capital was million  a decrease of million 
at december   working capital was million 
the decrease from to was driven largely by an increase in our current derivative liability reflecting the current high commodity price environment 
higher working capital in was due to cash reserves held to maintain margin calls 

table of contents for  we expect working capital to approximate million 
negative working capital is expected mainly due to fair values of our derivative contracts which obligations will be offset by cash flows from hedged production 
we anticipate cash reserves to be close to zero as we use any excess cash to fund capital obligations and any additional excess cash would be used to pay down our existing credit facility 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the overall commodity prices for oil and natural gas will be the largest variable driving the different components of working capital 
our operating cash flow is determined in a large part by commodity prices 
assuming moderate to high commodity prices  our operating cash flow should remain positive for the foreseeable future 
we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million for the level of these and other future expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly  depending on available opportunities and market conditions 
we plan to finance our ongoing expenditures using internally generated cash flow  cash on hand  and our existing credit agreement 
contractual obligations 
the following table illustrates our contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations and commercial commitments total thereafter notes notes revolving credit facility derivative obligations development commitments operating leases totals amounts included in the table above include both principal and projected interest payments 
see information presented in note indebtedness to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term debt 
derivative obligations represent liabilities for derivatives that were valued as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of the remaining portions of our derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note financial instruments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our derivative obligations 
development commitments represent authorized purchases  million of which represents work in process and is accrued at december  at december   we had million of authorized purchases not placed to vendors authorized afes which were not accrued at year end  but are budgeted for and expected to be made during unless circumstances change 
development commitments in the above table also include minimum transmission payments for electricity and compression services 
operating leases represent office space and equipment obligations that have remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year 
see note commitments and contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our operating leases 
investing activities 
cash used by investing activities increased by million from to this was due to increases in the two primary components acquisitions  which increased by million  and development of oil and natural gas properties  which increased million 
during  we purchased cortez oil gas  inc at a cost of million  net of cash acquired  bought properties in the overton field at a cost of million  and acquired other proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties totaling million 
in we acquired oil and natural gas properties totaling million 

table of contents the increase in cash used in the development of oil and natural gas properties of million in over was the result of drilling more gross wells net and the expansion of the hpai projects 
cash used by investing activities decreased by million from to this was due to offsetting changes in its two primary components acquisition of oil and natural gas properties  which decreased by million  and development of oil and natural gas properties  which increased million 
cash used for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties varies year to year based on our success in acquiring oil and natural gas properties 
during  we completed two major property acquisitions  the properties in the paradox basin of utah and the properties in the permian basin of west texas at a combined cost of million  while in we completed one major property acquisition  the elm grove properties in the north louisiana salt basin at a cost of million 
the increase in cash used in the development of oil and natural gas properties of million was the result of drilling more gross wells net in than in and the expansion of the hpai project into the little beaver unit of the cca 
operating activities 
for  cash provided by operating activities increased by million  primarily because of increased revenues due to increased production volumes and higher commodity prices compared to this increase resulted primarily from the million increase in net income coupled with an increase of dd a expense of million and non cash derivative fair value loss of million  offset by decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities from to of million 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million from to this increase resulted from the million increase in net income coupled with an increase in deferred taxes of million  offset by decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities from to of million 
the increase in net income was primarily due to increased production volumes and higher commodity prices compared to financing activities 
on april   we sold million of senior subordinated notes due in a private placement 
we received net proceeds of million after deducting commissions and paying other costs associated with the offering 
the notes were resold by the initial purchasers pursuant to a and regulation s 
the privately placed notes were subsequently exchanged for registered notes with substantially identical terms 
additionally  in we improved our financial flexibility and liquidity by amending and restating our credit facility and increasing our borrowing base from million to million 
at december   we had million outstanding on the borrowing base  million in outstanding letters of credit  and million available 
on june   we issued and sold  shares of our common stock to the public at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering  after underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses  were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds of this offering to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
on june   we filed a new universal shelf registration statement on form s with the sec 
the registration statement  which was declared effective by the sec on july   allows us to issue an aggregate of million of common stock  preferred stock  senior debt and subordinated debt 
during proceeds from financing activities were million as compared to million in in  we were able to close the initial elm grove acquisition and subsequent interests for million and fund our million capital drilling program with only a modest million increase in our revolving credit facility 
during  however  we increased our debt by million to fund two property acquisitions  central permian and paradox basin  and fund million in development expenditures 

table of contents liquidity our principal source of short term liquidity is our revolving credit facility 
we amended and restated our revolving credit facility on august  the amended and restated five year senior secured credit facility is with a bank syndicate comprised of bank of america  na and other lenders 
the amount we are able to borrow under the amended and restated credit facility is determined through semi annual borrowing base determinations and may be increased or decreased 
the initial borrowing base is million and may be increased to up to million 
the initial borrowing base of million reflects an increase of million as compared to our million borrowing base prior to august  the amended and restated credit facility matures on august  the amended and restated credit facility replaces our previous million credit facility  which would have matured in june our obligations under the amended and restated credit facility are guaranteed by our restricted subsidiaries and secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and a pledge of the capital stock and equity interests of our restricted subsidiaries 
amounts outstanding under the amended and restated credit facility are subject to varying rates of interest based on the amount outstanding under the amended and restated credit facility in relation to the borrowing base and whether the loan is a eurodollar loan or a base rate loan 
the following table summarizes the calculation of the various interest rates for both eurodollar and base rate loans ratio of total outstanding to borrowing base eurodollar loans a base rate loans b less than 
to libor base rate from 
to but less than 
to libor base rate from

to or greater libor base rate a the libor rate is equal to the rate determined by bank of america  na to be the british bankers association interest settlement rate for deposits in dollars for a similar interest period either one  two  three or six months  or such other period as selected by encore  subject to availability at each lender 
b the base rate is calculated as the highest of the annual rate of interest announced by bank of america  na as its prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 
the borrowing base will be redetermined each june and december  commencing june  the bank syndicate has the ability to request one additional borrowing base redetermination per year  and we are permitted to request two additional borrowing base redeterminations per year 
generally  if amounts outstanding ever exceed the borrowing base  we must reduce the amounts outstanding to the redetermined borrowing base within six months  provided that if amounts outstanding exceed the borrowing base as a result of any sale of our assets or permitted subordinated debt  we must reduce the amounts outstanding immediately upon consummation of the sale 
borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility may be repaid at anytime without penalty 
our revolving credit facility and the indentures related to the and notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
the covenants under our revolving credit facility are similar but generally more restrictive than the covenants under the indentures 
our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to financial covenants  including leverage  interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
our revolving credit facility limits our ability to effect mergers  asset sales  and change of control events 
these covenants also contain restrictions regarding our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
in some cases  our subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions that may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
the indentures related to our and notes also contains limitations on our ability to effect mergers and change of control events  incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  declare and pay dividends or make other restricted payments  enter into transactions with affiliates and subject our assets to liens 

table of contents based on current commodity price conditions  we believe that our capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of our business through based on our anticipated capital programs  we expect to invest our internally generated cash flow to replace production and enhance our development programs 
during  we have planned total capital expenditures of approximately million  although we may need additional capital to pursue acquisitions or other capital projects 
our current capital budget does not include any funds for development  exploitation  and exploration of oil and natural gas properties that we may acquire during our practice is to review our capital budget following a significant transaction 
substantially all of our capital expenditures are discretionary and will be undertaken only if funds are available and the projected rates of return are satisfactory 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices 
operations and other capital resources may not provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures 
additionally  we are required to maintain margin amounts and or letters of credits with the counterparties to our outstanding hedges if the mark to market value of our hedges reaches a certain negative value 
although we did not have any margin deposits with our counterparties as of december   if commodity prices were to rise substantially  we would be required to post margin with one or more counterparties to secure future hedging settlements 
as of february   we have million posted related to our derivatives margin accounts 
book capitalization 
at december   we had total assets of billion 
total capitalization was million  of which was represented by stockholders equity and by senior debt 
inflation and changes in prices while the general level of inflation affects certain of our costs  factors unique to the petroleum industry result in independent price fluctuations 
historically  significant fluctuations have occurred in oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  changing prices often cause costs of equipment and supplies to vary as industry activity levels increase and decrease to reflect perceptions of future price levels 
although it is difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas  price fluctuations have had  and will continue to have  a material effect on us 
the following table indicates the average oil and natural gas prices received for the years ended december    and average equivalent prices for   and were decreased by   and per boe  respectively  as a result of our hedging activities 
average prices per equivalent barrel indicate the composite impact of changes in oil and natural gas prices

you can identify our forward looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
these statements may include words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  should and other words and terms of similar meaning 

table of contents in particular  forward looking statements included in this report relate to  among other things  the following expected capital expenditures and the focus of our capital program  areas of future growth  our drilling program  future horizontal development  secondary development and tertiary recovery potential  the implementation of our high pressure air injection program  the ability to expand the program to other parts of the cca and the effects thereof  the completion of current hpai projects and the effects thereof  anticipated prices for oil and natural gas  projected revenues  lifting costs  lease operations expenses  production  ad valorem and severance taxes  dd a expense  general and administrative expenses  other operating expenses  and taxes  timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas  expected hedging positions and payments related to hedging contracts including the effectiveness thereof  expectations regarding working capital  cash flow and anticipated liquidity  projected borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and marketing of oil and natural gas 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
such statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the matters discussed in the subsection entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition below and elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 
we undertake no responsibility to update forward looking statements for changes related to these or any other factors that may occur subsequent to this filing for any reason 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition you should read carefully the following factors and all other information contained in this report 
if any of the risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and an investor may lose all or part of his investment 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile and sustained periods of low prices could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and these markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce 
prevailing oil and natural gas prices also affect the amount of internally generated cash flow available for repayment of indebtedness and capital expenditures 
in addition  the amount we can borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination based in part on changing expectations of future oil and natural gas prices 

table of contents the factors that can cause oil and natural gas price volatility include the supply of domestic and foreign oil and natural gas  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  political instability or armed conflict in oil or natural gas producing regions  the level of consumer demand  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  domestic political developments  and worldwide economic conditions 
the volatile nature of markets for oil and natural gas makes it difficult to reliably estimate future prices 
any decline in oil and natural gas prices adversely affects our financial condition 
if oil or natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time  we may  among other things  be unable to meet our financial obligations  make planned expenditures or raise additional capital 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated 
estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process that requires interpretations of available technical data and numerous assumptions  including certain economic assumptions 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes in conditions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated 
to prepare estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows  we must analyze many variable factors  such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas 
we must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data  and the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs 
actual results most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves referred to in this report is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the date of the estimate  holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate  and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate 
the results of high pressure air injection techniques are uncertain 
we utilize high pressure air injection  or hpai  techniques on some of our properties and plan to use the techniques in the future on a substantial portion of our properties  including our cca properties 
the additional production and reserves attributable to our use of the techniques  if any  are inherently difficult to predict 
if our hpai programs do not allow for the extraction of residual hydrocarbons in the manner or to the extent that we anticipate  our future results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we may be required to take write downs 
we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties if future estimated oil and gas prices are low  we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  our estimates of operating expenses or development costs increase substantially  or we experience poor performance from our development and exploitation activities 
we capitalize the costs to acquire  find and develop our oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts accounting method 
we review the carrying value of our properties quarterly  based on changes in expectations of future oil and natural gas prices  expenses and tax rates 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase 
our acquisition strategy subjects us to numerous risks that could adversely affect our results of operations 
acquisitions are an essential part of our growth strategy  and our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms is important to our long term growth 
depending on conditions in the acquisition market  it may be difficult or impossible for us to identify properties for acquisition or we may not be able to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable 
even if we are able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  our acquisition strategy depends upon  among other things  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and  in some cases  regulatory approvals 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including recoverable reserves  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  and potential environmental and other liabilities 
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
we are often not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an as is basis 
possible future acquisitions could result in our incurring additional debt  contingent liabilities and expenses  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 
competition for acquisitions is intense and may increase the cost of  or cause us to refrain from  completing acquisitions 
the failure to properly manage growth through acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations 
growing through acquisitions and managing that growth will require us to continue to invest in operational  financial and management information systems and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively manage our employees 
pursuing and integrating acquisitions involves a number of risks  including diversion of management attention from existing operations  unexpected losses of key employees  customers and suppliers of the acquired business  
table of contents conforming the financial  technological and management standards  processes  procedures and controls of the acquired business with those of our existing operations  and increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant management attention and financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
a substantial portion of our producing properties is located in one geographic area 
we have extensive operations in the williston basin of montana and north dakota 
as of december   our cca properties in the williston basin represented approximately of our proved reserves and of our production 
any circumstance or event that negatively impacts production or marketing of oil and natural gas in the williston basin could materially reduce our earnings and cash flow 
derivative instruments expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances 
we use derivative instruments in an effort to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas and to reduce our cash outflows related to interest 
our derivative instruments expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances  including when a counterparty to our derivative instruments is unable to satisfy its obligations  production is less than expected  or there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production 
derivative instruments may limit our ability to realize increased revenue from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  on january  sfas generally requires us to record each hedging transaction as an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
each quarter we must record changes in the fair value of our hedges  which could result in significant fluctuations in net income and stockholders equity from period to period 
drilling oil and natural gas wells is a high risk activity 
drilling oil and natural gas wells  including development wells  involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be discovered 
we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in drilling oil and natural gas wells 
our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions or miscalculations  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements and cost of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs and equipment 
the failure to replace our reserves could adversely affect our financial condition 
our future success depends upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced  unless we conduct successful exploitation  development  or exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both 
we may not be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis 

table of contents substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
if lower oil and natural gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit on our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility  we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to find  develop or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest 
we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 
our business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect us against these risks 
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for  producing and transporting oil and natural gas  such as fires  natural disasters  explosions  formations with abnormal pressures  blowouts  collapses of wellbore  casing or other tubulars  failure of oilfield drilling and service tools  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  formation water or drilling fluids  pressure forcing oil or natural gas out of the wellbore at a dangerous velocity coupled with the potential for fire or explosion  changes in below ground pressure in a formation that cause surface collapse or cratering  pipeline ruptures or cement failures  environmental hazards  such as oil spills  natural gas leaks and discharges of toxic gases  and weather 
if any of these events occur  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repair and remediation costs 
we do not maintain insurance against the loss of oil or natural gas reserves as a result of operating hazards  nor do we maintain business interruption insurance 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
we may experience losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or losses in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 
the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas  all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations 
future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states 
the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and  depending on their ultimate magnitude  could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our development and exploitation operations require substantial capital  and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms 
we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in development and exploitation projects 
we intend to finance these capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow from operations and external financing arrangements 
additional financing sources may be required in the future to fund our capital expenditures 
financing may not continue to be available under existing or new financing arrangements  or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional capital resources are not available  we may be forced to curtail our drilling and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 

table of contents the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of i 
jon brumley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  jon s 
brumley  our president  and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of mr 
i 
jon brumley  mr 
jon s 
brumley or other key personnel could adversely affect our business  and we do not have employment agreements with  and do not maintain key man insurance on the lives of  any of these persons 
our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists  engineers and other professionals 
competition for experienced geologists  engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense 
if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed 
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production is dependent upon transportation facilities over which we have no control 
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  oil and natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
any significant change in market factors affecting these infrastructure facilities could harm our business 
we deliver oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
these facilities may not be available to us in the future 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and many of our competitors have greater financial  technological and other resources than we do 
we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas acquisition  development  exploitation and production 
the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies 
we face intense competition from independent  technology driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in each of the following areas acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration  marketing our oil and natural gas production  integrating new technologies  and acquiring the equipment and expertise necessary to develop and operate our properties 
many of our competitors have financial  technological and other resources substantially greater than ours  which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies 
these companies may be able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
further  these companies may enjoy technological advantages and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can 
our ability to develop and exploit our oil and natural gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations  implement advanced technologies  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
we are subject to complex federal  state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 
exploration  development  production and sale of oil and natural gas in north america are subject to extensive federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations  including complex tax and environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  environmental protection  reports concerning operations and taxation 
under 
table of contents these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  reclamation costs  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
we do not believe that full insurance coverage for all potential environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost  and we may need to expend significant financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental regulations and permitting requirements 
we could incur substantial additional costs and liabilities in our oil and natural gas operations as a result of stricter environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
further  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
any of these liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could make it more expensive for us to conduct our business or cause us to limit or curtail some of our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging policy 
we have adopted a formal hedging policy 
the purpose of our hedging program is to mitigate the negative effects of declining commodity prices on our business 
we plan to continue in the normal course of business to hedge our exposure to fluctuating commodity prices 
however  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and in some instances management has determined it is more cost effective not to designate certain derivatives as hedges 
in very limited circumstances  the company may enter into derivative financial instruments to achieve other goals besides risk reduction 
one example would be the use of a fixed to floating interest rate swap to offset interest expense on fixed rate debt 
the company weighs the increased risk of the instrument versus the potential cash flow savings before entering into any derivative instrument designed to achieve any goal other than risk reduction 
counterparties 
our counterparties to hedging contracts include bnp paribas  calyon  deutsche bank  mitsui co  morgan stanley  shell trading  wachovia  and j 
aron company  a wholly owned subsidiary of goldman  sachs co 
at december  approximately    and of estimated hedged oil production was committed to morgan stanley  deutsche bank  j 
aron company  and calyon  respectively 
approximately   and of our estimated hedged gas production was contracted with j 
aron company  bnp paribas  mitsui co  and morgan stanley  respectively 
performance on all of our contracts with j 
aron company is guaranteed by its parent  goldman  sachs co 
we feel the credit worthiness of our current counterparties is sound and we do not anticipate any non performance of contractual obligations 
as long as each counterparty maintains an investment grade credit rating  pursuant to our hedging contracts  no collateral is required 
in order to mitigate the credit risk of financial instruments  we enter into master netting agreements with significant counterparties 
the master netting agreement is a standardized  bilateral contract between a given counterparty and us 
instead of treating separately each financial transaction between our counterparty and us  the master netting agreement enables our counterparty and us to aggregate all financial trades and treat them as a single agreement 
this arrangement benefits us in three ways 
first  the netting of the value of all trades reduces the requirements of daily collateral posting by us 
second  default by counterparty under one financial trade can trigger rights for us to terminate all financial trades with such counterparty 
third  netting of settlement amounts reduces our credit exposure to a given counterparty in the event of close out 
commodity price sensitivity 
the tables in this section provide information about derivative financial instruments to which we were a party as of december  that are sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas commodity prices 
we hedge commodity price risk with swap contracts  put contracts  and collar contracts 
swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes 
put contracts provide a fixed floor price on a notional amount of sales volumes while allowing full price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price 
collar contracts provide a floor price on a notional amount of sales 
table of contents volumes while allowing some additional price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price 
additionally  we occasionally sell short put contracts with a strike price well below the floor price of the collar 
these short put contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas  and accordingly  the mark to market change in the value of these contracts is recorded as fair value gain loss in the statements of operations 
thus  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and in some instances management has determined it is more cost effective not to designate certain derivatives as hedges 
the unrealized mark to market loss on our outstanding commodity derivatives at december  was approximately million 
as of december   the fair market value of our oil derivative contracts was million and the fair market value of our natural gas derivative contracts was million

subsequent to december   we entered into several additional oil and natural gas derivative contracts 
we purchased oil put contracts for  barrels a day with various counterparties at for the calendar year and entered into a basis swap contract for barrels a day for the period of february to december in addition to the oil contracts  we purchased natural gas put contracts for  mcf per day at for the period of february to december interest rate sensitivity 
at december   we had total long term debt of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of  and million bears at a fixed rate of 
the remaining outstanding long term debt balance of million is under our credit agreement and is subject to floating market rates of interest 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor 
as of december   we had one outstanding interest rate swap 
this swap does not qualify for hedge accounting as it swaps a fixed interest rate for a floating interest rate tied to libor
