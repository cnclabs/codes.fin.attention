critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

there is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to change significantly  adjustments to the allowances may be required 
while the company believes its recorded trade receivables will be collected  in the event of default in payment of a trade receivable  the company would follow normal collection procedures 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory for estimated obsolescence to reflect the lower of the cost of the inventory or its estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions for the company s products are substantially different than those projected by management  adjustments to these reserves may be required

these estimates have been developed in consultation with actuaries  the company s legal counsel and other advisors and are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  adjustments to these reserves may be required in the future

although raw material availability improved and prices trended downward during  the company believes that the favorable pricing and margin environment for its products should continue into the company s ability to continue to pass through higher raw material costs in its markets will be dependent on the competitive environment and the willingness of other producers to accept lower margins to retain volume at the expense of profitability together with the relative strength of demand for its products 
the company is continuing to pursue a broad range of initiatives to improve its financial performance 
over the prior year  the company focused on increasing the productivity levels and reducing the operating costs of its manufacturing facilities as well as its selling and administrative activities 
additional resources were directed towards the development of the company s engineered structural mesh esm business as well as other niche products and these efforts will be intensified going forward 
the company is also proceeding with organic growth initiatives that will reconfigure and expand the capacity of its esm and pc strand businesses which are expected to favorably impact its unit manufacturing costs and position it to satisfy future increases in demand in these markets 
in addition  the company is continually evaluating potential acquisitions in existing or related products that further its penetration in current markets served or expand its geographic presence 
the company anticipates that these actions together with the favorable outlook for the demand drivers of its products should favorably impact its financial performance in see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
during  the company lost production time at certain facilities because it was unable to obtain sufficient quantities of wire rod due to unanticipated delays in foreign deliveries and the opportunistic policies of domestic suppliers 
work stoppages during at two wire rod production facilities in north america have caused the supply of wire rod to tighten materially and prices to rise 
in addition  during november five domestic producers of wire rod filed antidumping petitions against offshore wire rod producers that represented of the imported wire rod supply for the year preceding the filing of the petitions 
while the company believes it has made adequate sourcing arrangements to maintain normal production schedules  the recurrence of wire rod shortages could result in lost production time at the company s facilities and adversely impact the company s results of operations and financial conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
the company monitors its underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believes that it can modify or adapt its hedging strategies as necessary 
commodity prices the company does not generally use derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposures to changes in commodity prices 
the principal commodity price exposure is hot rolled carbon steel wire rod  the company s primary raw material  which is purchased from both domestic and foreign suppliers and denominated in us dollars 
historically the company has typically negotiated quantities and pricing on a quarterly basis for both domestic and foreign steel wire rod purchases to manage its exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with its requirements 
following the tight supply conditions that persisted for most of which led to an increase in the frequency and size of price adjustments  wire rod availability improved and pricing trended lower during the company s ability to acquire steel wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign taxes  duties  tariffs  and other trade actions 
although changes in wire rod costs and the company s selling prices may be correlated over extended periods of time  depending upon market conditions  there may be periods during which it is unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices  which reduces its gross profit and cash flow from operations 
interest rates the company has debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates under its senior secured credit facility 
in connection with the refinancing that was completed on june   the company terminated interest rate swap agreements required by its previous lenders for payments totaling million and recorded a corresponding unrealized loss for hedging instruments in the third quarter of fiscal which  in accordance with gaap  was amortized and recorded as interest expense through the original termination date of january  based on the company s interest rate exposure and floating rate debt levels as of october   a basis point change in interest rates would have an estimated  impact on pre tax earnings over a one year period 
foreign exchange exposure the company has not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars  although such transactions have not been material in the past 
the company will occasionally hedge firm commitments for certain equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the decision to hedge any such transactions is made by the company on a case by case basis 
there were no forward contracts outstanding as of october
