introduction the company manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products  operating in the united states and in other countries  with products distributed in those countries and in other parts of the world 
the company operates in two reportable business segments  food packaging and protective packaging 
the company s principal food packaging products are flexible materials  associated packaging equipment systems  rigid containers and absorbent pads 
these products  many of which bear the cryovac trademark  package a broad range of perishable foods 
the company primarily sells the products in this segment to food processors  distributors  supermarket retailers and food service businesses 
the company s principal protective packaging products provide cushioning  surface protection and void fill 
the company primarily sells its protective packaging products and systems to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries 
the company s global sales and marketing staff numbered approximately  employees in the countries in which it operates  who sell and market the company s products through a large number of distributors  fabricators and converters  as well as directly to end users such as food processors  food service businesses  and manufacturers 
the company has no material long term contracts for the distribution of its products 
in  no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for or more of the company s consolidated net sales 
although net sales of both food packaging products and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter  the company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business 
competition for most of the company s packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics  service and price 
competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and  as a result  the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership 
the company s net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions  changes in the global economy  and the effects of foreign currency translation 
its costs can vary significantly with changes in petrochemical related costs  which are not within the company s control 
consequently  the company s management focuses on reducing those costs that the company can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible 
the company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions that may more strongly affect some of its competitors 
as is discussed below  the company s business generates substantial cash flow 
the company believes that this cash flow will permit it to continue to spend significantly on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of acquisitions and capital expenditures for property and equipment 
moreover  its ability to generate substantial cash flow should provide the company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises 
the company also believes that this cash flow will enable the company to make the settlement payment  including interest  that will be required of the company upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the w

requires that the dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt  such as the company s convertible senior notes due june  which were issued in july  be included in dilutive earnings per common share regardless of whether the contingency permitting holders to convert the debt into shares of common stock had been satisfied 
eitf issue no 
is applicable retroactively and requires restatement of prior periods during which the contingent convertible debt instrument was outstanding 
as a result  the and diluted earnings per common share calculations include million additional shares of common stock and exclude the associated interest expense of million and million  respectively  on the contingent convertible debt  net of income tax 
the diluted earnings per common share for include a per common share charge related to the company s redemption of all of its outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock on july  the company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its series a convertible preferred stock at a redemption price of per share 
the company also paid accrued dividends on the preferred stock from july  through july  in the aggregate amount of million 
the per share redemption price included a per share redemption premium  or an aggregate premium of million  and is reflected in basic earnings per common share in the basic earnings per common share calculations for and include gains of million and million  respectively  attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock

 provides for the issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the company s previously announced asbestos settlement as described above under the caption asbestos settlement and related costs  and provides for the exercise of dilutive stock options  net of assumed treasury stock repurchases 
for  the calculation of the weighted average number of common shares provides for the effect of the weighted average conversion of repurchased shares of preferred stock 
the company has not assumed the conversion of the outstanding preferred stock in the calculation of diluted loss per common share in  because the treatment of the preferred stock as the common stock into which it was convertible would have been anti dilutive  meaning the issuance would reduce the loss per common share 
the company did not reflect the shares of common stock reserved for issuance for the asbestos settlement in the calculation of diluted loss per common share in  since the effect would have been anti dilutive

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards  accounting guidance and disclosure requirements the company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards  accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 
note  new accounting pronouncements recently issued statements of financial accounting standards  accounting guidance and disclosure requirements  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which is contained in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  describes these new accounting pronouncements and is incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  known as us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates  and while any differences may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company does not believe that the differences  taken as a whole  will be material 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates 
commitments and contingencies litigation on an ongoing basis  the company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss  if any  can be made 
in assessing probable losses  the company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries  if any 
the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery  it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and possible impairment expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
self insurance the company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property  casualty  workers compensation and employee benefit claims 
the company accrues for outstanding reported claims  claims that have been incurred but not reported  and projected claims based upon management s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience  insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values 
although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments  actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 
pensions although the company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most us employees of the company are eligible to participate  the company does maintain defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its us employees and for many of its non us employees 
the company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations  the expected future rate of return on plan assets  the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions 
changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under sfas no 
income taxes the company s deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carryforwards 
the company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely  the company provides a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable earnings  with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards  to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods  the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance  which could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices  which may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates from time to time  the company may use interest rate swaps  collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s interest rate swaps are described in note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which is contained in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
the company reduced interest expense by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to the impact of interest rate swaps that were outstanding during each year 
at december  and  the company had no collars or options outstanding 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
at december   the carrying value of the company s total debt  which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps  was  million of which  million was fixed rate debt 
at december   the carrying value of the company s total debt  which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps  was  million of which approximately  million was fixed rate debt 
the estimated fair value of the company s total debt  including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps  and the cost of replacing the company s fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates  was  million at december  compared with  million at december  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at december  of million 
these changes in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt do not alter the company s obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt 
foreign exchange rates the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time  such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing  while limiting foreign exchange exposure and limiting or adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 
at december  and  the company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 
the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the terms of these instruments are generally twelve months or less 
at december  and  the company had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million and million  respectively 
the estimated fair values of these contracts  which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates  was zero and a net payable of million at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december  would have caused the company to pay approximately million to terminate these contracts 
the company s outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary 
the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities 
commodities the company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes 
generally  the company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
moreover  the company maintains minimal inventory levels of commodity raw materials and does not purchase substantial quantities in advance of its production requirements 
as a result  the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components
