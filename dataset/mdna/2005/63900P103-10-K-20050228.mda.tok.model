table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information  see the notes to the historical financial statements 
executive overview we engage principally in the business of owning and managing coal properties in the three major coal producing regions of the united states appalachia  the illinois basin and the western united states 
coal produced from our properties is burned in electric power plants located east of the mississippi river and in montana and minnesota 
as of december   we controlled approximately billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in nine states 
for the year ended december   approximately of the coal produced from our properties came from underground mines and approximately came from surface mines 
as of december   approximately of our reserves were low sulfur coal 
included in our low sulfur reserves is compliance coal  which constitutes approximately of our reserves 
we lease coal reserves to experienced mine operators under long term leases that grant the operators the right to mine our coal reserves in exchange for royalty payments 
as of december   our reserves were subject to leases with lessees 
for the year ended december   our lessees produced million tons of coal generating million in coal royalty revenues from our properties and our total revenue was million 
our revenue and profitability are dependent on our lessees ability to mine and market our coal reserves 
generally  our lessees make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of coal they sell  subject to minimum monthly  quarterly or annual payments 
in addition  our leases specify minimum monthly  quarterly or annual royalties 
these minimum royalties are generally recoupable over a specified period of time usually three to five years if sufficient royalties are generated from coal production in future periods 
we do not recognize these minimum coal royalties as revenue until the applicable recoupment period has expired or they are recouped through production 
until recognized as revenue  these minimum royalties are recorded as deferred revenue  a liability on our balance sheet 
most of our coal is produced by large companies  many of which are publicly traded  with professional and sophisticated sales departments 
we estimate that of our coal is sold by our lessees under coal supply contracts that have terms of one year or more 
however  over the long term  our coal royalty revenues are affected by changes in the market price of coal 
coal prices are based on supply and demand  specific coal characteristics  economics of alternative fuel  and overall domestic and international economic conditions 
beginning in the latter half of  the combination of the weaker us dollar  especially against the euro and the australian dollar  and the increase in ocean going freight rates caused an increase in demand for export coal because the united states was better able to compete with australia for the european market 
beginning in  our lessees located in appalachia experienced a greater demand for coal  and coal prices for both metallurgical and steam coal for those producers increased during because of these generally higher prices  our revenues in appalachia have increased to an average of per ton for the year ended december  from an average of per ton for the same period of coal royalty revenues from our appalachian properties represented of our total coal royalty revenues for the full year of our lessees have not appreciably increased production due to a number of constraints  including a shortage of labor  permitting and bonding issues and rail transportation problems 
approximately of our coal royalty revenues were from metallurgical coal  which was sold to steel companies in the eastern united states  south america  europe and asia 
prices of metallurgical coal have increased substantially in the past year 
metallurgical coal  because of its unique chemical 
table of contents characteristics  is usually priced higher than steam coal 
the current pricing environment for us metallurgical coal is strong in both the domestic and seaborne export markets 
demand for metallurgical coal in the united states has recently increased due to a recovery in the us steel industry 
pricing for us metallurgical coal has also been supported by reduced production at several us metallurgical coal mines in in addition to increased demand for metallurgical coal in the united states  demand for metallurgical coal has increased in international markets 
according to the international iron and steel institute  chinese steel consumption increased in  and asia pacific rim consumption of metallurgical coal continues to strain supply 
the tightening supply of metallurgical coal in global markets has been due in part to recent supply disruptions in australia  the world s largest coal exporter  and the decision by china  the world s second largest coal exporter  to restrict its metallurgical coal exports in order to satisfy domestic demand 
additionally  the recent weakness of the us dollar has made us metallurgical coal more competitive in international markets 
some steam coal with marginal metallurgical characteristics is now being sold in the metallurgical markets 
if demand for metallurgical coal falls below historic levels  metallurgical coal can also be used as steam coal 
however  some metallurgical coal mines on our properties may only operate profitably if all or a portion of their production is sold as metallurgical coal 
if the operators of these mines are unable to sell metallurgical coal  these mines may not be economically viable and may be closed 
on july   the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia issued an opinion and an injunctive order in the case of ohio valley environmental coalition  et al 
v 
william bulen 
judge joseph goodwin granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and enjoined further permitting by the army corps of engineers in southern west virginia under the nationwide permit program 
his order only impacts counties in southern west virginia and requires applicants in those counties to seek individual permits  which require a more intensive environmental review and public comment 
judge goodwin also ordered the corps of engineers to tell the companies that had received permits issued by the corps office in huntington  west virginia since january to halt any work under those permits where construction of the fills had not started by the time of the july order 
pending the resolution of any appeals  this decision will dramatically slow down the permitting process for our lessees in southern west virginia  and the increased cost of obtaining permits could render some of our smaller blocks of reserves uneconomic to develop 
in january of  plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the eastern district of kentucky on similar grounds challenging the legality of nationwide permit and seeking to enjoin the corps of engineers from issuing general permits under that authority 
should the district court follow the reasoning of ohio valley environmental coalition v 
bulen and similarly enjoin the corps of engineers from authorizing further general permits under nationwide permit  permittees may have to file for individual permits for fills that may result in increases in the costs of mining coal 
we will continue to monitor this litigation and its impact on the development of our coal reserves 
in addition to coal royalty revenues  we generated approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  from rentals  royalties on oil and gas and coalbed methane leases  timber  overriding royalty arrangements  and wheelage payments  which are toll payments for the right to transport third party coal over or through our property 
under our partnership agreement  we are required to distribute all of our available cash each quarter 
because distributable cash flow is a significant liquidity metric that is an indicator of our ability to generate cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in quarterly cash distributions paid to our partners  we view it as the most critical measure of our success as a company 
distributable cash flow is also the quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships 
distributable cash flow represents cash flow from operations less actual principal payments and cash reserves set aside for scheduled principal payments on the senior notes 
although distributable cash flow is a non gaap financial measure  we believe it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under gaap 
distributable cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap 
table of contents and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities 
distributable cash flow may not be calculated the same for nrp as for other companies 
a reconciliation of distributable cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is set forth below 
reconciliation of gaap net cash provided by operating activities to non gaap distributable cash flow for the year ended december  unaudited cash flow from operations less scheduled principal payments less reserves for future principal payments add reserves used for scheduled principal payments distributable cash flow acquisitions since our initial public offering in october  we have completed nine acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of million 
these acquisitions included approximately million tons of coal reserves on approximately  mineral acres 
acquisitions clinchfield 
in september  we purchased a tract of coal reserves from clinchfield coal company in dickenson county  virginia for million 
this property adjoins other property we own and represents approximately million tons 
we have subsequently combined this property with other properties under an existing lease to a subsidiary of alpha natural resources 
pardee minerals 
in may  we purchased a tract of coal reserves from pardee minerals llc in wise county  virginia for million 
this property adjoins other property we own and represents approximately million tons 
as a part of this transaction  we took an assignment of a coal lease under which a subsidiary of alpha natural resources is the lessee 
appolo 
in february  we purchased two tracts of property from appolo fuels  inc in bell county  kentucky for million 
this property adjoins the properties purchased in the blc acquisition and represents approximately million tons 
as a part of this transaction  an older below market lease affecting approximately million additional tons of adjacent reserves was renegotiated to current royalty rates 
blc properties 
in january  we purchased all of the mineral interests of blc properties llc for million 
this acquisition included coal  oil and gas and other mineral rights on approximately  acres that contain approximately million tons of coal reserves 
we lease these reserves to eight different lessees 
the transaction also included oil and gas and other mineral rights on approximately  additional acres 
the properties are located in kentucky  tennessee  west virginia  virginia  and alabama 
blc retained a non participating royalty interest in the oil and gas and other mineral rights 
acquisitions eastern kentucky reserves 
in november  we acquired coal reserves and related interests in eastern kentucky from a number of private sellers for million 
the acquisition included approximately million tons of coal reserves  an additional royalty interest in approximately million tons of coal reserves on contiguous property  and the right to collect a wheelage fee  which is a toll paid to 
table of contents transport coal across or through our properties  on million tons of coal 
we lease some of these reserves to appalachian fuels 
pinnoak resources 
in july  we acquired approximately million tons of coal reserves and an overriding royalty interest on additional coal reserves from subsidiaries of pinnoak resources  llc for million 
we lease these reserves to other subsidiaries of pinnoak resources 
pinnoak resources produces low volatile metallurgical coal from these longwall mines and has onsite preparation plants 
the properties consist of coal reserves located at two mine complexes the pinnacle mine in pineville  west virginia and the oak grove mine near birmingham  alabama 
alpha natural resources reserves 
in april  we acquired approximately  mineral acres containing approximately million tons of coal reserves from two subsidiaries of alpha natural resources  llc for million 
we leased most of these reserves to two alpha subsidiaries and seven other operators 
the properties are located in virginia adjacent to the coal properties that we acquired from el paso corporation in december  which are operated by another subsidiary of alpha natural resources  llc 
alpha natural resources royalty interest 
in february  we purchased an overriding royalty interest in the coal reserves that we purchased from el paso corporation in december from a subsidiary of alpha natural resources llc for million 
acquisitions el paso properties 
in december  we purchased million tons of coal reserves from el paso corporation for million 
we lease these reserves to alpha natural resources and thirteen other lessees 
more than half of the reserves are in kentucky  and the remainder are located in virginia and west virginia 
we also acquired the mineral rights in  acres that generate minor amounts of revenues from timber  oil and gas and other leases 
critical accounting policies coal royalties 
we recognize coal royalty revenues on the basis of tons of coal sold by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales 
generally  the lessees make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of coal they sell  subject to minimum monthly  quarterly or annual payments 
these minimum royalties are generally recoupable over a specified period of time usually three to five years if sufficient royalties are generated from coal production in future periods 
we do not recognize these minimum coal royalties as revenue until the applicable recoupment period has expired or they are recouped through production 
until recognized as revenue  these minimum royalties are carried as deferred revenue  a liability on the balance sheet 
timber royalties 
we sell timber on a contract basis where independent contractors harvest and sell the timber and  from time to time  in a competitive bid process involving sales of standing timber on individual parcels 
we recognize timber revenues when the timber has been sold or harvested by the independent contractors 
title and risk of loss pass to the independent contractors when they harvest the timber 
oil and gas royalties 
oil and gas royalties are recognized on the basis of volume of hydrocarbons sold by lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales 
generally  the lessees make payments based on a percentage of the selling price 
some leases are subject to minimum annual payments or delay rentals 
the minimum annual payments that are recoupable are generally recoupable over certain periods 
the minimum payments are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized either when the lessee recoups the minimum payments through production or when the period during which the lessee is allowed to recoup the minimum payment expires 
depletion 
we deplete coal properties on a units of production basis by lease  based upon coal mined in relation to the net cost of the mineral properties and estimated proved and probable tonnage in those properties 
we estimate proven and probable coal reserves with the assistance of third party mining 
table of contents consultants  and we use estimation techniques and recoverability assumptions 
our estimates of coal reserves are updated periodically and may result in adjustments to coal reserves and depletion rates that are recognized prospectively 
historical revisions have not been material 
timberlands are stated at cost less depletion 
we determine the cost of the timber harvested based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the amount of estimated net merchantable volume by geographic areas 
we estimate our timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
we update these estimates annually  which may result in adjustments of timber volumes and depletion rates that are recognized prospectively 
changes in these estimates have no effect on our cash flow 
new accounting standards historical practice in the extractive industry has been to classify leased mineral interests on a basis consistent with owned minerals due to similar rights of the lessor 
sfas no 
 business combinations  provides mineral rights as an example of a contract based intangible asset that should be considered for separate classification as the result of a business combination 
due to the potential for inconsistencies in applying the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in the extractive industries as they relate to mineral interests controlled by other than fee ownership  the emerging issues task force the eitf established a mining industry working group that addressed this issue 
at a march  meeting of the eitf  the task force reached consensus that an inconsistency existed as to the characterization of mineral rights as tangible assets as determined by the eitf and sfas no 
and as a result of the eitf s consensus  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp nos 
fas and fas  interaction of fasb statements no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and eitf issue no 
 whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets  which amend sfas no 
and and result in the classification of mineral rights as tangible assets 
prior to this consensus  the partnership provided separate line items for owned and leased coal interests within the consolidated balance sheet as of december  at december   leased coal interests are included within coal and mineral rights in the audited consolidated balance sheet 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
r accounting for stock based compensation  revised in  superseded apb no 
awards under our long term incentive plan have been accounted for on the intrinsic method under the provisions of apb no 
fas r  effective for the third quarter of  requires us to recognize a cumulative effect of the accounting change based on the difference between the fair value of the unvested awards and the intrinsic value recorded at the date of adoption 
additionally  fas r provides that grants after the effective date must be accounted for using the fair value method which will require us to estimate the fair value of the grant using the black scholes or another method and charge the estimated fair value to expense over the service or vesting period of the grant 
fas r requires that the fair value be recalculated at each reporting date over the service or vesting period of the grant 
use of the fair value method as compared with the intrinsic method  will not change the total expense to be reflected for a grant but it may impact the period in which expense is reflected by increasing expense in one period based upon the fair value calculation and lowering expense in a different period 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of fas r 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  a revision to fin consolidation of variable interest entities  the objective of which was to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and to determine when a vie should be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition to increasing disclosures  fin r requires a vie to be consolidated by a company if that company s variable interest will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns 
fin r postponed the effective date for public companies to march   except for certain investee relationships 
adoption of fin r did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
however  we may enter into future transactions that could be accounted for as a vie pursuant to fin r

coal royalty revenues 
coal royalty revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
coal production increased to million tons from million in  an increase of million tons or 
the substantial increase in coal royalty revenues is primarily due to the significantly higher sales prices realized by our lessees in in addition  approximately million tons and million of the increase in coal royalty revenues generated during the year ended december  were attributable to the acquisitions made subsequent to december  all of these acquisitions were in appalachia

in addition to higher coal prices and acquisitions  the properties that had significant increases in production and coal royalty revenues were pinnacle production increased from  tons to million tons and coal royalty revenues increased from million to million 
the mine operated on our property for two months in before ceasing production due to a ventilation disruption 
the mine resumed production in late april lynch production increased from million tons to million tons and coal royalty revenues increased from million to million 
these increases were due in part to new mines being opened on the property and also to higher prices being realized by the lessee 
sincell production increased from  tons to million tons and coal royalty revenues increased from  to million 
these increases were due to production moving onto our property which also benefited from the higher coal prices 
oak grove production increased from  tons to million tons and coal royalty revenues increased from million to million 
these increases were due to higher prices and owning the property for the year of versus six months in y o production increased from  tons to  tons and coal royalty revenues increased from  to million 
these increases were due to mines moving onto the property and higher prices being realized by the lessee 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in production and coal royalty revenues from our boone lincoln  chesapeake minerals and davis lumber properties 
on our boone lincoln property  production decreased from  tons to  tons and coal royalty revenues decreased from  to  these decreases were due to a greater proportion of production occurring on adjacent property 
on our chesapeake minerals property  production decreased from  tons to  tons and coal royalty revenues decreased from  to  these decreases were due to the depletion of reserves at one mine and a greater proportion of production occurring on adjacent property 
on our davis lumber property  production decreased from  tons to  tons and coal royalty revenues decreased from  to  these decreases were due to a previously active mine exhausting reserves

inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on operations for the years ended december   and environmental the operations our lessees conduct on our properties are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
as an owner of surface interests in some properties  we may be liable for certain environmental conditions occurring at the surface properties 
the terms of substantially all of our coal leases require the lessee to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
lessees post reclamation bonds assuring that reclamation will be completed as required by the relevant permit  and substantially all of the leases require the lessee to indemnify us against  among other things  environmental liabilities 
some of these indemnifications survive the termination of the lease 
because we have no employees  employees of western pocahontas properties limited partnership make regular visits to the mines to ensure compliance with lease terms  but the duty to comply with all regulations rests with the lessees 
we believe that our lessees will be able to comply with existing regulations and do not expect any lessee s failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have neither incurred  nor are aware of  any material environmental charges imposed on us related to our properties for the period ended december  we are not associated with any environmental contamination that may require remediation costs 
however  our lessees do conduct reclamation work on the properties under lease to them 
because we are not the permittee of the mines being reclaimed  we are not responsible for the costs associated with these reclamation operations 
in addition  west virginia has established a fund to satisfy any shortfall in our 
table of contents lessees reclamation obligations 
we are also indemnified by western pocahontas properties limited partnership  great northern properties limited partnership  new gauley coal corporation and arch coal  inc  jointly and severally  until october  against environmental and tax liabilities attributable to the ownership and operation of the assets contributed to us prior to the closing of the initial public offering 
the environmental indemnity is limited to a maximum of million 
risks related to our business we may not have sufficient cash from operations to pay the minimum quarterly distribution following establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner 
a substantial or extended decline in coal prices could reduce our coal royalty revenues and the value of our coal reserves 
our lessees coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that could result in lower coal royalty revenues to us 
we depend on a limited number of primary operators for a significant portion of our coal royalty revenues  and the loss of or reduction in production from any of our major operators could reduce our coal royalty revenues 
we may not be able to terminate our leases  and we may experience delays and be unable to replace lessees that do not make royalty payments 
if our lessees do not manage their operations well  their production volumes and our coal royalty revenues could decrease 
adverse developments in the coal industry could reduce our coal royalty revenues  and could substantially reduce our total revenues due to our lack of asset diversification 
any decrease in the demand for metallurgical coal could result in lower coal production by our lessees  which would thereby reduce our coal royalty revenues 
we may not be able to expand and our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to replace or increase our reserves or obtain other mineral reserves through acquisitions 
any change in fuel consumption patterns by electric power generators resulting in a decrease in the use of coal could result in lower coal production by our lessees  which would reduce our coal royalty revenues 
competition within the coal industry may adversely affect the ability of our lessees to sell coal  and excess production capacity in the industry could put downward pressure on coal prices 
lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with coal from properties other than ours  depriving us of the ability to receive amounts in excess of minimum royalty payments 
fluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of transportation could reduce the production of coal mined from our properties 
our reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may be inaccurate  which could materially adversely affect the quantities and value of our reserves 
our lessees work forces could become increasingly unionized in the future 
we may be exposed to changes in interest rates because any current borrowings under our revolving credit facility may be subject to variable interest rates based upon libor 
our lessees are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that may limit their ability to produce and sell coal from our properties 

table of contents a lessee may incorrectly report royalty revenues  which might not be identified by our lessee audit process or our mine inspection process or  if identified  might be identified in a subsequent period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  which includes adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below commodity price risk we are dependent upon the efficient marketing of the coal mined by our lessees 
our lessees sell the coal under various long term and short term contracts as well as on the spot market 
in previous years  a large portion of these sales were under long term contracts 
current conditions in the coal industry may make it difficult for our lessees to extend existing contracts or enter into supply contracts with terms of one year or more 
we estimate that of our coal is sold by our lessees under coal supply contracts that have terms of one year or more 
our lessees failure to negotiate long term contracts could adversely affect the stability and profitability of our lessees operations and adversely affect our coal royalty revenues 
if more coal is sold on the spot market  coal royalty revenues may become more volatile due to fluctuations in spot coal prices 
interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our current borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which may be subject to variable interest rates based upon libor 
management intends to monitor interest rates and may enter into interest rate instruments to protect against increased borrowing costs 
at december   we had no debt outstanding that was subject to variable interest rates
