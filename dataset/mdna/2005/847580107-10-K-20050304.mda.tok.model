item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
as referenced in the first paragraph of part i  this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
for a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and some of the risks and trends that could affect future results  see risk factors  in this report s item a 
business description and overview we commenced operations in april to design  manufacture and sell unlicensed wireless telephone communication systems for businesses 
our product portfolio consists of two types of product categories differentiated by the wireless technologies implemented into the product the link wireless telephone system link wts and netlink wireless telephones 
link wts uses a proprietary radio infrastructure in the mhz radio band targeted to organizations that require a dedicated wireless voice solution for their on premises mobile workforce 
the netlink wireless telephone products operate over ieee compliant wireless local area networks wlans in the mhz frequency band using standards based internet protocol ip technology 
netlink products are targeted to organizations that want both a wireless voice and wireless data solution on a single network 
we also offer an open application interface oai  which enables third party messaging applications to be integrated with our wireless telephones 
because of the recent advances in wireless local area network wlan technology  a significant portion of our development efforts will focus on our existing netlink products as well as new products that operate on a wlan 
for the year ended december   we achieved the highest levels of annual revenue and earnings in our history 
our revenue was million  and earnings per fully diluted share were on net income of million 
this represents a growth in year over year revenue  a growth in year over year earnings per fully diluted share  and a increase in year over year net income 
during  we successfully completed an executive management transition by adding david rosenthal as chief financial officer and executive vice president of administration and secretary and jill kenney as executive vice president of sales and marketing 
we also adjusted the composition of our board of directors with two new outside directors  one with substantial auditing and finance experience  and another with european business background and relationships 
revenue growth in was primarily due to a year over year increase of approximately million or for netlink product sales 
for the first time in our history  sales of our netlink wireless telephones surpassed sales of our link wireless telephone systems in the quarter ended december  in the fourth quarter of  netlink sales delivered million  or  of product revenue 
for the year  netlink sales accounted for of product revenue while link accounted for of product sales 
we expect that sales of netlink wireless telephones will continue to increase and eventually comprise a majority of our total product sales  for the following reasons 
presently  all of our international revenue is generated from the netlink product line and the majority of our sales through our original equipment manufacturers oem partners are netlink products 
in addition  because netlink wireless telephones are compatible  operating across converged voice and data networks in the enterprise  our netlink business is positioned to grow as wlan deployment expands 
although sales of netlink products exceeded link product sales in the fourth quarter of  we expect the composition of product revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we believe revenue in from link wireless telephone systems may increase from  or remain consistent with  the amount recorded in we intend to continue investing in the link product line because of the ongoing demand from our customer base  which is interested in a purpose built voice only wireless telephone system 
we are continuing our transition from a north american oriented niche market provider to a mainstream supplier of workplace wireless systems in partnership with some of the largest telecommunications manufacturers worldwide 
we have oem relationships and a private label relationship with six global telephony providers alcatel  avaya  inter tel  nec america  nortel 
table of contents and siemens  three of which were entered into in sales to our oems in accounted for approximately of our total net product revenue 
our oem alliances team  established in  will continue to seek relationships that will not only distribute our products but also co brand and private label these products 
the goal of this strategy is to provide greater exposure to our products through the reach these partners have with their customers 
because our oem partners primarily sell netlink wireless telephones  if oem sales increase  we would expect netlink revenue to also increase 
during  our international revenue increased to million  more than fourfold its contribution of million 
a large retail order in the fourth quarter of from an international customer through one of our resellers accounted for approximately million of this total 
in europe  our primary international market  our largest competition comes from products implementing the digital enhanced cordless telecommunications dect standard 
however  because dect products are based on legacy technology and are not wi fi compatible  several of the leading dect distributors are now selling our netlink wireless telephones as their next generation offering for operation on a converged internet protocol ip voice and data network 
in  net product revenue from our indirect resellers accounted for of product revenue  oem partners contributed  and came from our direct sales team 
our target vertical markets are currently home improvement  grocery  and other retail store chains  hospitals  nursing homes  distribution centers  manufacturing and service centers  corporate offices  government and education 
we believe these markets are largely under penetrated and offer significant opportunity for growth 
we are also targeting new vertical markets including auto dealerships  banking  legal and hospitality 
in addition  we will closely monitor demand in the general enterprise market and make incremental investments in that market as wlan become more widely deployed and demand warrants 
our overall gross margin was for the year the primary reason for the lower gross margin as compared to in was stronger netlink sales and increased sales through our oem partners 
we realize lower margins on products sold through oem relationships because of the pricing arrangements inherent in these relationships 
we expect oem sales to increase as a percentage of our total sales in  and if this occurs  we will experience continued downward pressure on gross margins 
another factor that will directly affect gross margins is product mix 
the netlink product line carries a lower gross margin than our link products because sales of link systems include greater percentages of network infrastructure products that generate higher gross margins 
during  we paid our first full year of quarterly cash dividends of per share to our stockholders totaling million 
with the re initiation of our stock repurchase program in the third quarter  we repurchased  shares of outstanding common stock for million 
under our stock repurchase plan  we may repurchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock as of december  we were able to pay quarterly dividends  repurchase company stock and still grow our cash and investments in because of positive cash from operations 
the fourth quarter of was our twenty fourth consecutive quarter in which we generated positive cash from operations 
on a continual basis  we will evaluate options for utilizing our cash in an effort to maximize returns to our stockholders  including paying dividends  making purchases under our stock repurchase program and investing in longer term instruments as interest rates warrant 
as of march   we have completed our management assessment and audit of our internal controls to be in compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
as of december   we assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
based on our assessment and those criteria  we believe that we maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting as of december  we have included management s report on our assessment of our internal controls in this annual report on page in addition  kpmg llp  as the independent registered public accounting firm has audited our internal controls over financial reporting as well as our assessment and have issued their report on our internal controls over financial reporting and our assessment thereof 
kpmg llp s report is included in this annual report on page f complying with sarbanes oxley section has been a significant effort and has cost us over million to date in outside auditing and consulting fees alone 
we estimate ongoing external costs related to complying with sarbanes oxley section to be approximately million annually 
as we look to  we are targeting our revenue to grow in the area of year over year 
this revenue growth is expected to follow historical trends of quarterly seasonal patterns 
notwithstanding s unusual revenue fluctuations  first quarter revenue is typically planned to be down sequentially from the fourth quarter 
historically  second quarter revenue has grown from the first quarter  with the third quarter being relatively even with the second quarter  and we typically finish the year with a strong fourth quarter 
our product gross margin will have more downward pressure as oem and netlink sales increase 
as a result  we believe our gross margin will move to the lower end of the range of of total revenue in we will continue to target research and development expenses of about of total revenue in these investments are necessary for the innovation required to maintain our position as a leader in wi fi telephony and to ensure that we continue to provide products that interface with more enterprise telephone systems and applications than any other provider in our industry 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses ended at of total revenue in our goal is to maintain this level for the full year of because we are expanding our field sales organization whose primary responsibility will be to generate demand for our products  we expect to see some front end loading of sales expense that should decline as a percent of revenue as the year progresses 
service revenues should remain in the range of of our total revenue 
with the growth in revenue and increased leverage of our current facilities and organization  operating margin before the impact of stock related compensation recorded after adoption of sfas r share based payment for the full year is expected to be in the to range  building throughout the year

we expect that research and development expenses will be approximately of net sales for fiscal in compared to  research and development costs increased primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits  related to increases in headcount and merit raises  as well as tooling costs 
in addition  depreciation expense increased as we purchased research and development test equipment 
the percentage of net sales decreased from the prior year due to an increase in sales 
in compared to  the increase in dollars spent and as a percentage of net sales  was due to increases in headcount  merit raises and the rising cost of employee benefits

in compared to  the increase in dollars spent was primarily due to increasing our infrastructure to support future growth  which resulted in increased salaries and employee benefits to hire and retain personnel  as well as an increase in professional fees  insurance and amounts for corporate governance and disclosure requirements related to sarbanes oxley legislation 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in legal fees related to legal proceedings  as we met our insurance deductible and expenses became fully covered by insurance  and we experienced a decrease in bad debt expense 
the decrease of general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was due to economies of scale resulting from increased sales

liquidity and capital resources year ended year ended december  december  cash from operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities we have funded our operations since inception with cash provided by operations  supplemented by equity financing and leases on capital equipment 
as of december   we had  of cash  cash equivalents and long term and short term investments in marketable securities 
during  we generated cash from operations of  consisting principally of net income of  adjustments for depreciation and amortization  income tax benefit from exercises of stock options  and provision for excess 
table of contents and obsolete inventory that reconcile net income to cash  as well as increases in taxes payable  accrued liabilities  and deferred revenue and was offset by increases in trade accounts receivable  inventory and other assets and a decrease in accounts payable 
the decrease in cash from operating activities in compared to primarily relates to larger increases in trade accounts receivable and inventory in offset by higher net income 
the increase in the trade accounts receivable balance relates to an increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of as of december   our trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso was days compared to days as of december  this increase in dso was due to higher oem sales in the fourth quarter which have longer payment terms 
as oem sales increase  we expect our dso to trend up 
the increase in inventory relates to oem demands for higher volume  an expanding product mix  and manufacturing and distribution pipeline requirements 
in  investing activities used cash of  of which  was used for the purchase of marketable securities and  was used for purchases of property and equipment primarily related to purchases of a new surface mount technology assembly system  computer equipment  software  research equipment  and manufacturing tooling and molds 
our investments in marketable securities consist of available for sale and held to maturity securities invested in municipal bond funds and government securities 
we used  of cash in financing activities during  which was primarily a result of the issuance and payment of four quarterly cash dividends totaling  and purchases of  shares of the outstanding common stock now classified as treasury stock at a cost of  these cash outflows were offset by proceeds of  received from common stock option exercises and issuances of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had no debt outstanding  and there were no off balance sheet financing arrangements  unconsolidated subsidiaries  commitments or guarantees  except as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity at december   was  which represented of total assets 
as of december   we had working capital of  compared to  at december  the decrease in working capital of  occurred primarily from the purchase of investments in marketable securities classified as long term  the purchase of capital assets  the repurchase of common stock and the cash dividend paid  offset by cash flows from operations and proceeds from common stock option exercises and stock issuances 
as of december   our current ratio ratio of current assets to current liabilities was  compared with a current ratio of as of december  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient  based on our presently anticipated needs  to fund necessary capital expenditures  to provide adequate working capital  pay dividends and to finance our expansion for the foreseeable future next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  when required by us 
if additional funds were to be raised through the sale of equity securities  additional dilution to the existing stockholders would be likely to result 
aggregate contractual obligations and commercial commitments we incur various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in our normal course of business 
such obligations and commitments consist primarily of the following lease commitments 
we lease our facilities under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through we have other obligations for office equipment that expire at various dates through purchase commitments 
we incur various purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory  as well as goods and services  in the normal course of business 
these obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders with delivery dates from six to twelve months from the purchase date  and in certain cases  purchase orders that contain non cancelable non returnable terms and conditions associated with these purchase arrangements 
we are committed to accept delivery of such materials pursuant to such purchase orders subject to various contract provisions which allow us to delay receipt of such orders 
such orders may or may not include cancellation costs payable by us 
in the past  we have been required to take delivery of materials from suppliers that were in excess of demand requirements and we have previously recognized charges and expenses related to such excess material  related primarily to engineering changes 
if we are not able to adequately manage our supply chain and adjust such commitments for changes in demand  we may incur additional inventory expenses related to excess and obsolete inventory 
such expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
indemnifications 
we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas  accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements 

table of contents as of december   expected future cash payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments were as follows thereafter total operating leases purchase commitments other obligations total contractual obligations and commercial commitments we believe our existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy these contractual obligations and commercial commitments and that the ultimate payments associated with these commitments will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity position 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our reported financial position and results of operations depends 
we determined the critical accounting principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this report 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  receivables  product warranty obligations  inventories and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time of making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or assumptions in the estimate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the following table presents information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors sales and deferred revenue collectibility is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered and seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of invoiced amounts based upon our assessment of the ability of the customer to pay 
we determine whether collectibility is reasonably assured based on the customer s current financial condition and on possible credit deterioration  the indirect and oem channels ability to sell through the products purchased and the relationship we have with our customers 
customer ability to pay customer ability to sell to end user our revenue recognition policy is based on complex and dynamic rules established by the securities and exchange commission and other governing bodies 
these rules require us to make judgments with regard to post delivery obligations 
when significant post delivery obligations exist  revenue is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled or until we have established sufficient history to estimate the cost of our obligation 

table of contents financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors accounts receivable collectibility of invoiced amounts estimating the collectibility of accounts receivable requires us to make judgments about the credit quality and economic viability of customers based on information available to us 
we use information available at the time of credit issuance  such as dunn bradstreet credit report  payment history  or financial information provided by the customer 
for ongoing customers and past due balances  we have discussions with our customers to determine if economic conditions have deteriorated  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
historical experience regarding payment history customer creditworthiness monitoring collections and payments from customers deterioration of customer s economic condition after date of invoice changes in credit loss rates from historical rates used financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors cost of goods sold and inventories obsolete  unmarketable or excess inventory estimating obsolete  unmarketable or excess inventory requires us to forecast future demand and market conditions 
changes in our product strategy can result in obsolete inventory 
we base our estimate on the difference between the cost of held inventory and the expected market value of the inventory 
product lifecycle evaluation of customer demand for various product types analysis of inventory on hand with no estimated future demand from customer base financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets we are required to estimate whether recoverability of deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings in the related tax jurisdictions 
we use historical and projected future operating results  including a review of the eligible carryforward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
tax law changes variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity 
table of contents financial statement critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions approaches caption s item required used key factors warranty warranty obligations estimating warranty liability requires us to forecast  using historical data as a basis  future product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs 
we base our estimate on historical and current trends of product failure rates  repair cost per unit and service delivery costs 
we have contractual commitments to various customers that require us to incur costs to repair an epidemic defect 
historically we have not experienced significant costs related to epidemic failure 
costs would be accrued for an epidemic defect when an epidemic defect is identified and the costs of repair can be reasonably estimated 
monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers actual historical return rates at the time of sale and updating estimates throughout the warranty period monitoring our customer base for possible epidemic defects estimated failure rates  repair costs per unit  and service delivery costs in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
revisions to any of the discussed estimates  or other non critical items  could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued or proposed accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on january  we are currently evaluating the effect  if any  that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are subject to market risk due to changes in united states interest rates 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities  and are not currently impacted significantly by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk as part of our cash management strategy  at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of approximately  mainly in the form of bank demand deposits  money markets and government securities 
we have completed a market risk sensitivity analysis of these cash and cash equivalents based on an assumed point change in interest rates 
if market rates had increased or decreased point during the year ended december   our interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately  
table of contents risk factors the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
for more information regarding the forward looking statements contained in this report  see the introductory paragraph to part i of this report 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report  in considering our business and prospects 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing spectralink 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us also may impair our business operations 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to fulfill quarter end customer orders  then we could lose revenue and customers 
the volume of customer orders for our products typically increases significantly at the end of each quarter 
generally  sales in a given quarter are distributed approximately as follows in the first month  in the second month  and in the third month 
we face significant challenges in meeting this demand 
it is difficult to ensure that we have the resources available to meet any such increase in order volume since it is very difficult to predict what the level of demand will be 
we may not have the personnel and or systems necessary to fulfill the large order volume or the ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to meet an increased order volume 
if we are unable to meet demand from our customers for our products in a cost effective manner  then we might lose revenue and customers  or incur increased operating costs  either of which would harm our business 
many of the orders for our products are realized at the end of the quarter  which makes it difficult to forecast or adjust our operating activities quickly in response to an unexpected increase or decrease in customer demand 
due to the timing of orders from customers  we have often recognized a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of a quarter 
as a result  minor fluctuations in the timing of orders and the shipment of products may  in the future  cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the demand for our products depends upon many factors and is difficult to forecast 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause problems in our operations 
the lead time required to assemble our systems is often longer than the lead time our customers provide to us for delivery of their product requirements 
therefore  we often must place orders in advance of expected purchase orders from our customers 
as a result  we have only a limited ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  which could cause us to have either too much or too little inventory of a particular product 
further  the business relationship which we have with offshore group to use a mexico facility to assemble our products may not be able to provide product in a timely manner 
additionally  once we receive an order  it requires sufficient time to complete the configuration of our product to our customer s individual phone systems 
our inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner would lead to lost sales and impede our ability to increase our revenue 
conversely  a large portion of our expenses  including rent and salaries  is fixed and difficult to reduce 
our expenses are based in part on expectations for our revenue 
if our revenue does not meet our expectations  the adverse effect of the revenue shortfall upon our operating results may be acute in light of the fixed nature of our expenses 
for instance  our stock price declined substantially after our preliminary announcement in july  that reported results for second quarter of lower revenue  earnings and gross margins  higher g a costs and slower than anticipated order flow 
if similar circumstances occur in the future  the price of our common stock would likely decline further 
our reliance on sole or limited sources of supply for many components and equipment used in our manufacturing process 
we rely on sole or limited sources of supply for many components and equipment used in our manufacturing process 
the delay  inability  or refusal of any of these suppliers to ship these components or equipment could interrupt our manufacturing process and ability to manufacture products in a timely manner to meet customer demand 
the limited number of sources for many of these components may also prevent us from decreasing our reliance on certain suppliers and finding other sources at competitive prices 
unforeseen price increases by any of the sole or limited source suppliers could negatively impact product margins and the financial performance of our company 
because many of our current and planned products are or will be highly complex  they may contain defects or errors that are detectable only after deployment in complex networks and which  if detected  could have a negative effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
many of our complex products can only be fully tested when deployed in live existing wireless networks 
as a result  end users may only discover defects or errors or experience breakdowns in their networks after the products have been deployed 
if any of these products contain defects  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation might be damaged significantly and customers might be reluctant to buy our products 
these defects could interrupt or delay sales 
we may have to invest significant capital and other resources to correct these 
table of contents problems 
if we fail to provide solutions to the problems  we will also incur product recall  repair  warranty or replacement costs 
these problems might also result in claims against us by our customer or others 
in addition  the occurrence of any defects or errors in these products  could result in failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share  cancellation of orders  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  increased service and warranty costs in excess of our estimates  diversion of resources  and  increased insurance costs and other losses to our business or to end users 
if we experience product failure that indicates either manufacturing or design deficiencies  we may be required to recall units in the field and or stop producing and shipping such products until the deficiency is identified and corrected 
in the event of such product failures  our business could be adversely affected resulting in reduced revenue  increased costs and decreased customer satisfaction 
end users have discovered errors in our products in the past and may discover errors in our products in the future 
in addition  if our costs of remediating problems experienced by our customers exceed the expectations used in developing our warranty reserves  these costs may adversely affect our operating results 
consequently  our warranty failure could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
our ability to attract and retain personnel  including key technical and management personnel 
much of the future success of our company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel  including technical  marketing and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the wireless communications industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel we need 
many of our key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes stock options 
the financial accounting standards board and other agencies have enacted changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that will require us and other companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants  employee stock purchase plans and other equity incentives 
in addition  applicable stock exchange listing standards relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur higher compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business 
the risk of business interruption arising from our dependence on our manufacturing facility located in boulder  colorado  and the business relationship we have with offshore group to use a facility in empalme  sonora  mexico which provides assembly services 
we are highly dependent on our boulder  colorado manufacturing facility  which is home to the majority of our manufacturing and repair operations 
we are also highly dependent upon our business relationship with offshore group to provide management services and an assembly facility located in empalme  sonora  mexico 
any event that may disrupt or indefinitely discontinue either of the facilities capacity to manufacture  assemble and repair our products could greatly impair our ability to generate revenue  fulfill orders and attain financial goals 
for instance  we may experience delays in the receipt of assembled product from the facility in mexico should the border between the us and mexico close 
our ability to respond to rapid technological changes within the on premises wireless telephone industry 
the wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short product life cycles  and evolving industry standards 
to remain competitive  we must develop or gain access to new technologies in order to increase product performance and function  reduce product size  and maintain cost effectiveness  develop new products for existing and emerging wireless communications markets  and introduce such products in a timely manner  implement an emerging wireless standards or multiple emerging wireless standards  quickly enough to satisfy market demands and without significant product redesign or the need to allocate additional resources to comply with multiple standards  develop or obtain access to advanced wireless capabilities as they become available  and design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis 
we may not successfully execute on our vision of product requirements because of errors in defining product marketing requirements  planning or timing  technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion  or a lack of appropriate resources 
due to the competitive nature of our business  any failure by us to meet any of these challenges could render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive and thereby materially and adversely affect our business  reputation  and operating results 
potential fluctuations in our future revenues  gross margins and operating results 
we have experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  significant quarterly fluctuations in revenue  gross margins and operating results due to numerous factors  some of which are outside our control 
among other things  these 
table of contents factors include changes in customer  geographic or product mix  including mix of configurations within each product group  fluctuating market demand for  and declines in the average selling prices of  our products  the timing of  and delay of  significant orders from customers  seasonality in demand within our various sectors  increases in material or labor costs  excess inventory  obsolescence charges  changes in shipment volume  loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand  increases in price competition  changes in the mix of our distribution channels including our oem partners  government regulation of frequency spectrum  increases in warranty costs  and introduction of new products and costs of entering new markets 
for example  historically we have not operated with a significant order backlog  and a substantial portion of our revenue in any quarter has been derived from orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
accordingly  our revenue expectations are based almost entirely on our internal estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
planned expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based in large part on these estimates  and if orders and revenue do not meet expectations  our revenues  gross margins and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the uncertainty about economic prospects in some sectors of our target customer market  adversely impacts their information technology spending and our business 
our business has from time to time been adversely impacted by the uncertainty about general economic prospects in some sectors of our target customer market within the united states and worldwide  because this uncertainty has resulted in a decline in  or a failure to increase  their information technology spending 
consumers of information technology in some of these sectors may defer  and in some cases cancel  their purchase decisions 
our operating results may be adversely affected as a result 
we expect the economic uncertainty to continue to adversely impact our business and operating results for at least the next few quarters and perhaps significantly longer 
the adverse impacts from economic uncertainty include longer sales cycles  lower average selling prices  fewer large orders from a single customer and reduced revenue 
changes in rules and regulations of the fcc and other regulatory agencies 
the wireless communications industry  regulated by the federal communications commission fcc in the united states and similar government agencies in other countries  is subject to changing political  economic  and regulatory influences 
regulatory changes  including changes in the allocation of available frequency spectrum  or changing free un licensed to free based spectrum licensing could significantly impact our operations in the united states and internationally 
we are dependent on indirect sales channels for most of our revenue 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from a variety of third party business partners  including oems  distributors and resellers 
during the year ended december   sales of our products through our indirect distributors accounted for of our product revenue  of which of product revenue was contributed by our oem partners 
our contracts with third party business partners do not require those partners to purchase minimum quantities of our products or services 
in fact  some of our third party business partners also offer the products of some of our competitors 
in addition  our oem agreements do not restrict an oem from acquiring products from a third party or independently developing products and services that would directly compete with us 
we cannot guarantee that any of our third party business partners will continue to market our products or devote significant resources to doing so 
furthermore  we will  from time to time  terminate or adjust some of our relationships with third party business partners in order to address changing market conditions  adapt such relationships to our business strategy  resolve disputes  or for other reasons 
any such termination or adjustment could have a negative impact on our relationships with third party business partners and our business  and result in decreased sales through third party business partners or threatened or actual litigation 
if our third party business partners do not successfully market and sell our products or services for these or any other reasons  our sales could be adversely affected and our revenue could decline 
for instance  we experienced a decrease in sales by distributors during the second quarter of when those distributors downsized their businesses in reaction to the economic slowdown and  as a result  had fewer sales representatives marketing our products 
in addition  our third party business partners have confidential information concerning our products and services  product release schedules and sales  marketing and third party reseller operations 
although we have nondisclosure agreements with our third party business partners  we cannot guarantee that any third party business partner 
table of contents would not use our confidential information to compete with us 
furthermore  since we have experienced lower gross margins related to sales to our oem partners  we may experience lower gross margins in the future if sales to our oem partners become a larger percentage of product sales 
our success depends in part upon our ability to maintain and expand these relationships 
the loss of any major partner  the failure to attract new partners or inability to maintain the current level of revenue from our existing partners could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our revenue and earnings are seasonal 
seasonality and other factors may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and net income 
our business is seasonal based on budget cycles in various vertical markets such as healthcare and retail 
this causes significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results 
generally  revenue and operating results are sequentially down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter  sequentially higher in the second quarter  sequentially flat or slightly higher or lower in the third quarter  and strongest in the fourth quarter 
actual results from operations may or may not follow these normal seasonal patterns in a given year leading to performance that is not in alignment with expectations 
a lower than anticipated rate of acceptance of domestic and international markets using the b standard 
our netlink wireless telephones are compatible with the ieee b standard for use on b compliant wireless wlan 
consequently  demand for netlink wireless telephones depends upon the acceptance of markets utilizing b compliant networks 
this depends in part upon the initial adoption of the b standard in international markets  as well as enhancements to that standard in the us and foreign markets where the standard has already been adopted 
additionally  the acceptance of b compliant networks may move more slowly  if at all  if competing wireless networks are established and utilized 
additionally  the deployment of wireless voice and data systems has been inhibited by security concerns including the potential of unauthorized access to data and communications transmitted over or accessible through a wireless system 
potential customers may choose not to purchase our products until wireless systems are developed which provide for greater security 
further  our products may not be compatible with secure wireless systems that may be developed in the future 
if markets utilizing b compliant networks do not grow as we anticipate  our growth would be impeded and we would not be able to factor the related revenue into our growth in the future 
if the b standard does not emerge as the dominant wireless standard in our markets  or multiple standards are adopted that require different technologies we may need to spend time and resources to add functionality to meet the additional standards and many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value 
further  to the extent that additional standards are adopted  our product differentiation could be minimized and our implementation may not be interoperable with the standard  necessitating additional product development to meet the standard which may cause product delays 
the market for on premises wireless telephone systems may fail to grow or to grow as quickly as we anticipate 
we derive our revenue principally from the sale of wireless  on premises telephone systems and related installation and other services relating to those systems 
therefore  our future operating results depend on the demand for those types of services 
if this market does not grow or grow quickly  our future results of operations would be significantly harmed 
in particular  increased demand for our netlink product depends on the growth of the voice over wi fi related market 
although netlink sales have grown significantly in recent periods  the market for deployment of converged voice and data wireless networks in the general enterprise continues to be immature 
we expect that this will remain the case unless that market moves through its acceptance of ip wireless applications  standards adoption increases to reduce complexity  and customers deploy wireless ip access points more fully throughout their enterprise networks in densities required to support wireless voice traffic 
our reliance on a limited number of significant customers 
a portion of our revenue in the past has been derived from a limited number of customers 
we also have experienced quarter to quarter variability in sales to each of our major customers and expect this pattern to continue in the future 
we might not be able to execute on our business plan if we lose key management or technical personnel  on whose knowledge  leadership and technical expertise we rely  or if new members of our management team fail to work effectively together 
our success depends heavily upon the contributions of our key management and technical personnel  whose knowledge  leadership and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
many of these individuals have been with us for several years and have developed specialized knowledge and skills relating to our technology and business 
others have been promoted within  or have joined  senior management roles recently 
for example  in september  john elms  our vice president of operations  was promoted to president and chief executive officer  while bruce holland  the former president and chief executive officer  continued with us as chairman of the board until he resigned from the board in march additionally  in october  we hired john kelley as vice president of operations 
in february  michael cronin  our vice president of sales and marketing resigned his positions of vice president of sales and marketing and corporate officer effective april   although he agreed to remain an employee to assist us with the transition through june  in april  nancy hamilton  our vice president 
table of contents of finance and administration and chief financial officer  resigned her positions as vice president of finance and administration and chief financial officer and corporate officer effective april   although she remained an employee to assist us with the transition through july  additionally  in april  we hired david rosenthal as executive vice president of finance and administration  chief financial officer  and corporate secretary  and we hired jill kenney as executive vice president of sales and marketing effective may  our success depends in part upon the ability of new executives to work effectively together and with the rest of our employees to continue to develop our technology and manage the operation and growth of our business 
all of our executive officers and key personnel are employees at will 
we have no employment contracts for our chief executive officer  executive vice president of finance and administration and chief financial officer  executive vice president of sales and marketing  executive vice president of engineering and executive vice president of operations  and do not maintain key person insurance on any of our executives 
we might not be able to execute on our business plan if we were to lose the services of any of our key personnel 
if any of these individuals were to leave us unexpectedly  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors  and could experience a loss in productivity while any such successor develops the necessary training and experience 
our reliance on our b technology partners to continue to provide the wireless local area network for our netlink product  and to provide access points which support spectralink s voice priority technology 
in the absence of a wireless voice prioritization standard to ensure quality of service  we rely on b technology partners  such as proxim  symbol technologies  and cisco systems to continue to provide wireless local area network support for our netlink product  and to provide access points that support svp capability 
if any of our technology partners fail to provide voice prioritization support for our products  the market opportunity for netlink products would be reduced and our future results of operations would be materially harmed until we find new b technology partners or voice prioritization standards are adopted 
our ability to generate continued market growth rates may require us to participate in industry consolidation 
as part of our business strategy to continue our market growth for ip telephony  we may engage in acquisitions or mergers with other companies  or individual product lines  technologies and or personnel or become the target for a merger or acquisition 
acquisitions or mergers involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products  and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in process research and development  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  assume liabilities  record goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges  experience possible delays in financial reporting and additional resources required to integrate erp systems  incur additional financial costs and personnel resources which may be required to timely comply on a consolidated basis with section  management s internal controls and procedures for financial reporting of the sarbanes oxley act of  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expenses  and become subject to intellectual property or other litigation mergers and acquisitions of telecommunications companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that any future acquisitions would be successful and would not materially adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could also materially harm our business and operating results 
risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions 
please see the risk factor below entitled if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and transition existing products and respond to emerging technological trends and customers changing needs  our operating results and market share may suffer for additional information 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and transition existing products and respond to emerging technological trends and customers changing needs  our operating results and market share 
table of contents may suffer 
the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain  and if we fail to accurately predict customers changing needs and emerging technological trends  our business could be harmed 
we must commit significant resources to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept 
we may encounter delays in deploying new or improved products 
for instance  our new products may not properly function with our customers existing telephone systems  or our new products may contain defects or bugs 
these incompatibilities  defects or bugs may not be detected until our customers begin to install the products or thereafter 
we may need to modify the design of our new or improved products if they have incompatibilities  defects or bugs  which could result in significant expenditures as we seek to remedy the problems  delays in the purchase of the products or cancelled orders 
we may also encounter delays in the manufacturing and production of the new products 
additionally  the new products may not be commercially successful 
demand for existing products may decrease upon the announcement of new or improved products 
further  since products under development are often announced before introduction  these announcements may cause customers to delay purchases of any products  even if newly introduced  until the new or improved versions of those products are available 
if customer orders decrease or are delayed during the product transition  we may experience a decline in revenue and have excess inventory on hand which could decrease gross profit margins 
our gross margins might decrease if customers  who may otherwise choose to purchase existing products  instead choose to purchase lower priced models of new products 
delays or deficiencies in the development  manufacturing  and delivery of  or demand for  new or improved products could have a negative effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our ability to manage potential expansion of operations in the us and internationally 
we intend to expand our existing domestic and international operations  and to enter new markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we currently have limited experience in marketing and distributing our products internationally and in developing versions of products that comply with local standards 
we may also not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
international operations are subject to other inherent risks  including foreign government regulation of technology or unexpected changes in regulatory and customs requirements  difficulty and delays in accounts receivable collection  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and taxation consequences 
we face increasing competition in the on premises wireless telephone system market 
the on premises wireless telephone system industry is competitive and influenced by the introduction of new products and new entrants into the industry 
the competitive factors affecting the market for our systems include product functions and features  frequency band of operation  ease of use  quality of support  product quality and performance  price  network and application integration capabilities  distribution channels  and the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts 
most of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  research and development  and marketing resources than us 
as a result  our competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or may devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products than us 
enterprise adoption of standards for wireless lan and voip may lead to the commoditization of wireless telephone technology and the availability of low cost alternative products 
other purchasers may prefer to buy their b wireless telephone systems from a single source provider of wireless local area networks  or lans  such as cisco systems which provides b wireless infrastructure and wireless telephones 
because we focus on wireless on premises telephone communications  we cannot serve as the sole source for a complete telephone or data communications system 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
further  if a potential customer is already using a competing product or system  that potential customer may not be willing or able to make the investment necessary to replace such a system with our wireless telephone system 
in addition  there may be potential customers who choose another technology because of cost or their belief that their needs do not require the full function provided by our wireless telephone systems 
the certification and approval process for our netlink product for use in countries that support the b standard 
foreign countries  which support the b standard  could provide future markets for our netlink products 
however  countries certification and approval processes for b compatible products  such as ours  are typically time consuming and costly 
if we have difficulty obtaining certification and approval by foreign countries for our netlink wireless telephone product  then we and or our distributor channels may not be able to gain access to the markets in these countries in a timely fashion  if at all  which would limit international growth of our business 
our ability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
our future success depends  in part  upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures  and nondisclosure and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections provide only limited protection and may be time consuming and expensive to obtain and enforce 
there can be no assurance that our issued patents will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or provide meaningful protection against competition 
if challenged  our patents might not be upheld or their claims could be narrowed 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately  our competitors might 
table of contents gain access to our technology 
as a result  our competitors might offer similar products and we might not be able to compete successfully in our market 
moreover  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
also  our competitors may independently develop similar  but not infringing  technology  duplicate our products  or design around our patents or our other intellectual property 
in addition  other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts with us  and we may not be able to enforce our rights in the event of these breaches 
furthermore  we expect that we will increase our international operations in the future  and the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights 
any litigation surrounding our rights could force us to divert important financial and other resources from our business operations 
the assertion of intellectual property infringement claims against us 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe upon issued patents  patents to be issued in the future  or other intellectual property rights of others 
we may in the future be notified that we are infringing upon certain patent and or other intellectual property rights of others 
although there are no such pending lawsuits against us that we are infringing upon intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not occur in the future 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related methods that are important to us 
litigation may be necessary in the future to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  to enforce our intellectual property rights  or to protect our trade secrets 
we may also be subject to claims from customers for indemnification 
any resulting litigation  regardless of our resolution  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
if it were determined that our products infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  we would need to obtain licenses from these parties or reengineer our products in order to avoid infringement 
we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all  or to reengineer our products successfully 
moreover  if we are sued for infringement and lose the suit  we could be required to pay substantial damages or be enjoined from licensing or using the infringing products or technology 
any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products 
we rely on the availability of third party licenses 
many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties  especially through our oem agreements 
if we terminate oem or technology partner relationships  it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products 
there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters  could harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
changes in securities laws and regulations have increased our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec  have required changes in some of our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the act also required the sec to implement additional new rules on a variety of subjects 
in addition to rules made by the sec  the nasdaq national market has adopted revisions to its requirements for companies  such as us  that are nasdaq listed 
these developments have increased our legal and financial compliance costs  and make some activities  like sec reporting obligations  more expensive and difficult 
for instance  in seeking to comply with section management s internal controls and procedures for financial reporting of the sarbanes oxley act of  we spent approximately  in outside services associated with documenting  testing and auditor review of our internal controls during in addition  these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and are continuing to estimate the timing and magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to issuance and interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec  and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
for example  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation  
table of contents sfas and supercedes apb opinion no  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  our reported earnings will be decreased when we change our accounting policy in accordance with the fair value based concepts soon to be required 
the historic volatility of our stock price  which may make it more difficult to resell shares at prices attractive to sellers 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to remain subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
for example  during the month period ended december   the closing price of our common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  including variations in our actual or anticipated quarterly or annual results  market conditions in our industry  the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole  announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  introduction of new products or product enhancements or new pricing policies by us or by our competitors  government regulation  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by our competitors  recruitment or departure of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant orders  changes in the market valuations of other telecommunications companies  the amount of liquid financial resources available to us  the gain or loss of significant customers including oems  and changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology related stocks in particular  could decline  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall for reasons not necessarily related to our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the market price of our stock also might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
securities class action litigation is often brought against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of its securities  and we have previously been sued in several purported securities class action lawsuits 
further  certain of our management and directors were also sued in purported stockholder derivative actions 
while the consolidated class action suit has been settled  we have not finally resolved the stockholder derivative actions 
although we believe that the stockholder derivative actions lack merit  due to inherent uncertainties in litigation  we cannot accurately predict the outcome of this litigation 
an adverse determination could have a significant effect upon our business and materially affect the price of our stock 
moreover  regardless of the ultimate result  it is likely that the lawsuit will require us to incur expenses and divert management s attention and resources from other matters  which could also adversely affect our business and the price of our stock
