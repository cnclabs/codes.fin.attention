item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all expectations  forecasts  assumptions  and beliefs about our future financial results  condition  operations  strategic plans  and performance are forward looking statements  as described in more detail below under the heading forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially because of a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed under the heading risk factors below  and elsewhere in this form k 
historical statements made herein are accurate only as of the date of filing of this form k with the securities and exchange commission and may be relied upon only as of that date 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of natural gas and liquids in north america and selected international locations 
highlights highlights of forest s performance in were production total production increased to bcfe  a increase from increased reserves forest s year end estimated proved reserves are  bcfe  higher than year end  notwithstanding bcfe of production in and oil and gas property sales of bcfe 
lower g a overhead was million  and g a expense was million  lower than  or on a per mcfe basis 
exploration track record forest had continuing success in with its foothills wild river project in canada and completed two successful exploratory test wells in the deep gulf of mexico shelf area as well as two gas discoveries in onshore cook inlet  alaska 
acquisition accomplishments forest invested million to acquire bcfe of estimated proved reserves 
reduced leverage forest ended the year with a total debt to book capitalization ratio of less than 
outlook we anticipate a favorable market environment in based on our outlook for continuing growth in the us economy and emerging energy consumers such as china and india 
in our view  the economic growth and the resultant increased demand for oil and gas should continue to support relatively high commodity prices 
within this environment  we anticipate strong financial performance by forest 
our inventory of exploitation and exploration projects is at a high level  which should provide us good visibility of future production additions 
our plan anticipates cash flow from operations greater than our exploration and development spending levels  which will be used  in part  to fund acquisitions 
we face numerous challenges in in particular  our gulf of mexico assets are mature and experience inherent high production declines 
it will be difficult to stem this decline and manage expected operational cost increases 
we will continue to pursue asset acquisition opportunities aggressively 
however  competition for these assets has been and will continue to be intense 
due to a higher commodity price environment  we anticipate service costs as well as costs of equipment and raw materials such as steel will be higher in than in our challenge will be to add reserves  through drilling and acquisitions  and operate our productive assets cost efficiently in a manner that achieves attractive returns for our shareholders 
recent acquisition on february   we announced that we had agreed to purchase all of the stock of a private company whose primary asset is an operated average working interest of in the buffalo wallow field in texas and approximately  gross acres primarily in hemphill and wheeler counties  texas 
forest will pay an estimated million in cash for the stock and assume an estimated million of debt net of working capital 
the closing is subject to customary closing conditions and expected to occur on march  the buffalo wallow field has estimated proved reserves of bcfe 
forest expects to initially fund the cash purchase price by borrowing under its bank credit facilities 
results of operations net earnings for were million compared to net earnings of million in and million in the increase in earnings in compared to was the result of increased average oil and gas sales prices  increased sales volumes  and reduced g a expense  offset partially by increased oil and gas production expense and increased depletion expense 
the increase in earnings in compared to was due primarily to the combination of increased average oil and gas sales prices  increased sales volumes  and decreased oil and gas production expense 
discussion of the components of the changes in our annual results follows 
oil and gas sales sales volumes  weighted average sales prices  and oil and gas sales revenue for the years ended december    and are included in part i  items and business and properties production  average sales prices  and average production costs 
the increase in oil and gas sales revenue in compared to was the result of a increase in production and a increase in price realizations per mcfe 
the increase in our sales volumes was due primarily to acquisitions made during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of the increase in oil and gas sales revenue in compared to was the result of a increase in price realizations per mcfe  combined with a increase in sales volumes 
the increase in sales volumes was attributable primarily to acquisitions made during oil and gas production expense oil and gas production expense commonly referred to as lease operating expense includes direct costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities  costs of expensed workovers  product transportation costs from the wellhead to the sales point  and production and ad valorem taxes 
the components of oil and gas production expense for the years ended december    and were as follows years ended december  change change in thousands direct operating expense and workovers   product transportation    production and ad valorem taxes    total oil and gas production expense   oil and gas production expense per mcfe in  lease operating expense loe was million or per mcfe  as compared to million or per mcfe in loe from the properties acquired in late and during accounted for approximately of the increase 
the acquired properties had higher initial loe due to deferred maintenance of the properties at the time of acquisition  and a portion of the acquired properties had higher product transportation rates than compared to our historical average rates 
forest also spent approximately million more in on workovers than it did in  approximately million of the increase related to the properties acquired in and production and ad valorem taxes increased over due to higher oil and gas sales revenue and assessed property values 
the loe reduction in compared to  on both an absolute and a per unit basis  reflects cost reduction measures employed throughout forest s operations  offset somewhat by increases in production taxes and ad valorem taxes 
general and administrative expense  overhead the following table summarizes the components of total overhead costs incurred during the periods years ended december  change change in thousands total overhead costs    overhead costs capitalized    total overhead costs expensed    general and administrative expense per mcfe 


total number of employees at end of year the decrease in overhead costs from through were attributable primarily to cost reduction measures in corporate areas 
the percentage of overhead capitalized remained relatively constant  ranging between and 
the percentage of overhead capitalized in was up slightly over due to a greater reduction in general corporate costs which are capitalized at lower rates 
depreciation and depletion  international impairments depreciation and depletion expense for the years ended december    and was as follows years ended december  change change in thousands depreciation and depletion expense    depletion expense per mcfe the increases in depletion expense on an equivalent unit of production basis of 
in and 
in were due primarily to downward revisions in estimated proved reserves in the fourth quarter of see discussion of the revision to the estimated proved reserves in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following costs of undeveloped properties were not subject to depletion at the periods indicated december  united states canada international total in thousands the increase in the total undeveloped properties from to was due primarily to the additional undeveloped properties acquired in in conjunction with the purchase of wiser 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the wiser acquisition 
in  forest recorded impairments of oil and gas properties located outside of north america of million million net of taxes related to evaluations of projects in albania  germany  and italy 
in  we recorded impairments of million million net of taxes  related primarily to evaluations of projects in albania  italy  romania  switzerland  and tunisia 
of this amount  approximately million related to our interest in a project in albania 
no impairments were recorded in accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion expense of approximately million in and million in was related to the accretion of forest s asset retirement obligation pursuant to sfas no 
 adopted january  sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
using a cumulative effect approach to adopt sfas no 
 forest recorded an after tax credit of approximately million in the first quarter of other income expense  net the components of other income expense  net for the years ended december    and were as follows years ended december  in thousands loss on extinguishment of debt   foreign currency exchange gain  franchise taxes    forest s share of income loss of equity method investee   realized and unrealized losses gains on derivative instruments other  net  total other income expense  net    the foreign currency exchange gain in is related to the repayment of canadian intercompany debt denominated in us dollars 
franchise taxes are paid to the states of texas and louisiana based on capital investment deployed in these states  determined by apportioning total capital as defined by law 
forest s share of income or loss of equity method investee relates to our ownership of a pipeline company that transports crude oil in alaska 
losses on extinguishment of debt relate to redemptions of our and senior subordinated notes for amounts in excess of par value 
interest expense interest expense of million in was greater than  due to higher average debt balances 
interest expense of million in was less than  primarily because the effects of greater average debt balances were more than offset by decreased average interest rates on variable and fixed rate debt and by amortization of gains recognized on termination of interest rate swaps 
current and deferred income tax expense forest recorded current income tax expense before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million in compared to 
million in and 
million in the increase in each of the years was due primarily to current taxes required to be paid under the federal alternative minimum tax and  in  to state income taxes 
deferred income tax expense before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in each of the years was due primarily to increased net income before income taxes 
in and  the increase was partially offset by a decrease in canadian taxes of million and million  respectively  due to a canadian federal income tax rate reduction from to over a five year period beginning in in total  forest s effective income tax rates for the years ended december    and  were   and  respectively 
these rates were based on a us federal statutory rate of in each of the three years 
differences between the us federal statutory rate and the effective rate were primarily due to foreign and state statutory rates and permanent book to tax differences 
reference should be made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory rate to our effective rate for each period presented 
results of discontinued operations on march   the assets and business operations of our canadian marketing subsidiary were sold to cinergy canada  inc cinergy for million cdn 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  cinergy will continue to market natural gas on behalf of canadian forest for five years through february unless subject to prior contractual commitment  and will also administer the netback pool that we formerly administered 
we could receive additional contingent payments related to this sale over the next five years if cinergy meets certain earnings goals with respect to the acquired business 
the subsidiary s results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all years presented 
the components of loss income from discontinued operations for the years ended december    and are as follows years ended december  in thousands marketing income  net   general and administrative expense   interest expense other income expense depreciation  current income tax benefit expense deferred income tax expense  loss on sale of discontinued operations  loss income from discontinued operations  net of tax  liquidity and capital resources in  as in  we expect our cash flow from operations to provide our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than large acquisitions 
any remaining cash flow from operations will be available for acquisitions  debt repayment  or other corporate purposes 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production have a significant impact on operating cash flows 
while significant price declines in would adversely affect the amount of cash flow generated from operations  we utilize a hedging program to partially mitigate that risk 
as of february   forest has hedged approximately bcfe of its production primarily to support the economics of recent acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
this level of hedging provides certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a substantial portion of our production 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
for further information concerning our and hedging contracts  see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging program 
another source of liquidity is our million revolving bank credit facilities  which we entered into in september which mature in september at february   we had million of cash on hand  million of indebtedness under the bank credit facilities  and an unused borrowing base of million 
we use the credit facilities to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions in the united states and canada as needed 
we believe that our available cash  cash provided by operating activities  and funds available under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operating  interest  and general and administrative expenses  our capital expenditure budget  and our short term contractual obligations at current levels for the foreseeable future 
the capital markets have been our principal source of funds to finance large acquisitions 
we have sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past  and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future for acquisitions 
nevertheless  ready access to capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties  as explained under risk factors below 
historical cash flow net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used by investing activities  and net cash used provided by financing activities for the years ended december    and were as follows years ended december  change change in thousands net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used by investing activities   net cash used provided by financing activities  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to of approximately million was due primarily to an increase in net income and depreciation expense a non cash expense totaling million 
the decrease in cash used by investing activities in of million was due primarily to a decrease in capital expenditures of million and an increase in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties of million  which were offset by an increase in cash used for the acquisitions of oil and gas properties of million 
net cash used by financing activities in of million included the net repayment of bank borrowings of million  offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of options and warrants of approximately million in the aggregate 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due primarily to higher average oil and gas prices 
the increase in cash used by investing activities in was due primarily to increased investments in oil and gas properties as well as acquisitions in the fourth quarter of net cash provided by financing activities in included net bank borrowings of million  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  and the exercise of options and warrants of approximately million in the aggregate  offset partially by cash used for the redemption of the senior subordinated notes and the repurchase of common stock of million in the aggregate 
capital expenditures expenditures for property acquisitions  exploration  and development were as follows year ended december  in thousands property acquisitions proved properties    undeveloped properties   exploration direct costs    overhead capitalized    development direct costs    overhead capitalized    total capital expenditures    does not include estimated discounted asset retirement obligations of million and million related to assets placed in service during the years ended december  and total capital expenditures include both cash expenditures and accrued expenditures 
in addition  the property acquisitions include a gross up for deferred income taxes of approximately million in and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for the allocation of purchase consideration for various acquisitions in and forest s anticipated expenditures for exploration and development in are estimated to range from million to million 
some of the factors impacting the level of capital expenditures in include crude oil and natural gas prices  the volatility in these prices  the cost and availability of the oil field services  and weather disruptions 
dispositions of oil and gas properties as part of our ongoing operations  we routinely dispose of non strategic assets 
assets with marginal value or which are not consistent with our operating strategy are identified for sale or trade 
during  we sold assets  including oil and gas assets with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcfe  for total proceeds of approximately million 
during  we disposed of oil and gas assets with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcfe for total proceeds of approximately million 
bank credit facilities on september   forest entered into bank credit facilities totaling million  consisting of a million united states credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase and a million canadian credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  toronto branch 
the credit facilities mature in september subject to the agreement of forest and the applicable lenders  the size of the credit facilities may be increased by million in the aggregate 
availability under the credit facilities will be based either on certain financial covenants included in the credit facilities or on the loan value assigned to forest s oil and gas properties 
forest s current corporate credit ratings are ba with a negative outlook from moody s and bb with a stable outlook from s p 
if forest s corporate credit rating by moody s is ba or higher and bb or higher by s p  the credit facilities may be governed by certain financial covenants 
alternatively  if forest s corporate credit rating is ba or lower by moody s or bb or lower by s p  availability under the credit facilities will be governed by a borrowing base global borrowing base 
availability under the credit facilities currently is governed by the global borrowing base 
the global borrowing base is currently set at million  with million allocated to the united states credit facility and million allocated to the canadian credit facility 
the determination of the global borrowing base is made by the lenders taking into consideration the estimated value of forest s oil and gas properties in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
this process involves reviewing forest s estimated proved reserves and their valuation 
while the global borrowing base is in effect  it is redetermined semi annually  and the available borrowing amount could be increased or decreased as a result of such redeterminations 
in addition  forest and the lenders each have discretion at any time  but not more often than once during any calendar year  to have the global borrowing base redetermined 
a revision to forest s reserves may prompt such a request on the part of the lenders  which could possibly result in a reduction in the global borrowing base and availability under the credit facilities 
if outstanding borrowings under either of the credit facilities exceed the applicable portion of the global borrowing base  forest would be required to repay the excess amount within a prescribed period 
if we are unable to pay the excess amount  it would cause an event of default 
at december   the unused borrowing amount under the global borrowing base was approximately million 
on february   our unused borrowing amount was approximately million 
at december   there were outstanding borrowings of million under the us credit facility at an average interest rate of  and there were no borrowings under the canadian credit facility 
at february   there were outstanding borrowings of million under the us credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of  and there were million of outstanding borrowings under the canadian credit facility at an average interest rate of 
we also had used the us and canadian credit facilities for letters of credit in the amount of million at december  and february  the credit facilities include terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  mergers  and acquisitions 
the credit facilities also include several financial covenants 
availability  interest rates  security requirements  and other terms of borrowing under the credit facilities will vary based on forest s credit ratings and financial condition  as governed by certain financial tests 
in particular  any time that availability is not governed by the global borrowing base  the amount available and forest s ability to borrow under the credit facilities is determined by certain financial covenants 
also  even when availability is governed by the global borrowing base  certain financial covenants can still affect the amount available and forest s ability to borrow amounts under the credit facilities 
the credit facilities are collateralized by a portion of forest s assets 
forest is required to mortgage  and grant a security interest in  of the present value of the proved oil and gas properties of the company and its subsidiaries 
forest has also pledged the stock of several subsidiaries to the lenders to secure the credit facilities 
under certain circumstances  forest could be obligated to pledge additional assets as collateral 
if forest s corporate credit ratings by moody s and s p improve and meet pre established levels  the collateral requirements would not apply and  at forest s request  the banks would release their liens and security interests on forest s properties 
credit ratings our senior notes are separately rated by two ratings agencies moody s and s p 
in addition  moody s and s p have assigned forest a general corporate credit rating 
our bank credit facilities include conditions that are linked to our credit rating 
the fees and interest rates on our commitments and loans  as well as our collateral obligations  are affected by our credit ratings 
if the ratings on our senior notes are changed by either rating agency  the primary effect on us will be a change in the cost of our debt 
our ability to raise funds and the costs of such financing activities may be affected by our credit rating at the time any such activities are conducted 
common stock offerings in june  we issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds from this offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to fund a portion of the wiser acquisition 
in october  forest issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds from this offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share in january net proceeds from this offering before any exercise of the underwriters over allotment option were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated expenses of the offering 
an additional 
million shares of common stock were issued in february pursuant to exercise of the underwriters over allotment option for net proceeds of million 
debt offerings in july  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes  due  at of par for proceeds of million net of related offering costs 
the net proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our us credit facility 
note redemptions in july  we redeemed  at of par value  million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes due that were issued by wiser 
the note redemption was funded using borrowings under our us credit facility 
in january  we redeemed the remaining million outstanding principal amount of our senior subordinated notes at of par value  resulting in a loss of million recorded in the first quarter of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  after total in thousands bank debt   other long term debt    operating leases       unconditional purchase obligations  other liabilities      derivative liabilities    approved capital projects   total contractual obligations     bank debt consists of million related to our united states and canadian credit facilities 
for a more detailed discussion of our long term debt  see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
other long term debt consists of the principal obligations on our senior notes  but does not include anticipated interest payments 
for a more detailed discussion of our long term debt  see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
consists primarily of leases for office space and leases for well equipment rentals 
consists primarily of firm commitments for gathering  processing  and pipeline capacity 
gathering  processing  and pipeline capacity commitments in areas that have secondary markets may be mitigated in the future if firm capacities are no longer required 
other liabilities represent current and noncurrent liabilities that are comprised of benefit obligations and asset retirement obligations  for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance 
see critical accounting estimates and polices below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations 
derivative liabilities represent liabilities for oil and gas commodity derivatives that were valued as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of the our derivative liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in valuing derivative instruments 
consists of our net share of budgeted expenditures under authorizations for expenditure afe that were approved by us and our joint venture partners as of december  includes afes for which forest is the operator as well as those operated by others 
in addition to the above commitments  we are obligated to make approximately million of capital expenditures over the next four years pursuant to the terms of foreign concession arrangements 
forest also makes delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling or production of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease 
our total maximum commitment under these leases  through  totaled approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
other obligations we hold a equity interest in an affiliate that owns a petroleum pipeline system within the cook inlet area of alaska 
in our capacity as a shareholder  we have agreed to fund our proportionate share of the operating costs and expenses of this affiliate 
we may have contingent obligations in the event the affiliate experiences cash deficiencies 
in addition  we may have other contingent obligations if the affiliate is unable to meet its indemnification requirements or its obligations to the operator of the pipeline 
we are unable to predict or quantify the amount of these obligations  although we have obtained insurance to mitigate the impacts of certain possible outcomes 
surety bonds in the ordinary course of our business and operations  we are required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies 
as of february   we had obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain of our operations in the united states and canada in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
see part i  items and business and properties regulation for further information 
critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions critical estimates the following items are estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements that management deems to be critical in nature because either i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates could have reasonably been used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or ii in our judgment changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on the presentation of forest s financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
oil and gas reserve estimates our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production  and property taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
reference should be made to independent audit of reserves included under part i  items and business and properties of this document as well as estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise under part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fair values of derivatives the fair market value of all derivative instruments is recognized as an asset or liability on our balance sheet 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is i a cash flow hedge or ii a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge 
changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for fair value hedges  to the extent the hedge is effective there is no effect on the statement of operations  because changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as other income or expense 
the estimated fair values of the company s derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
these values are based upon  among other things  future prices  volatility  time to maturity  and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions  or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated  because energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  the fair values of our derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations in estimated fair value from period to period 
for example  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the forward oil and natural gas prices used to calculate the fair value of the derivative instruments of per barrel and 
per mmbtu  respectively  would change the fair values of our derivative instruments by approximately million 
it has been our experience that commodity prices are subject to large fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue 
actual gains or losses recognized in conjunction with our commodity derivative contracts will likely differ from those estimated at december  and will depend exclusively on the price indexes of the commodities on the specified settlement dates provided by the derivative contracts 
as the majority of our commodity derivative contracts qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements  while the use of different estimates in the calculation of the fair values of the commodity derivative contracts may materially affect our balance sheet  it would not materially affect our reported earnings or cash flows 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on future income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in operations in the period in which the change is enacted 
the amount of future income tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the value of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward periods are reduced 
asset retirement obligations the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore locations at the end of the oil and gas production operations 
forest s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs  or asset retirement obligations  is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments  because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future  and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
inherent in the calculation of the present value of our asset retirement obligations aro under sfas are numerous assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
in addition  increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
critical policies the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the full cost method and the successful efforts method 
the differences between the two methods can lead to significant variances in the amounts reported in our financial statements 
we have elected to follow the full cost method  which is described below 
full cost method of accounting under the full cost method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement  and abandonment activities is capitalized  with a corresponding asset retirement obligation liability recorded 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
changes in estimates of reserves or future development costs are accounted for prospectively in the depletion calculations 
assuming consistent production year over year  our depletion expense will be significantly higher or lower if we significantly decrease or increase our estimates of remaining proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to assess individually the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool  or reported as impairment expense in the consolidated statements of operations  as applicable 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations and the effect of cash flow hedges 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash writedown is required 
a ceiling test impairment could cause forest to record a significant non cash loss for a particular period  however  future dd a expense would be reduced 
at december   the spot price that forest used for its canadian low gravity oil in computing its cost center ceiling was temporarily depressed to a level at which forest s capitalized costs in its canadian cost center would have exceeded the cost center ceiling  as described above  by approximately million 
subsequent to december  and before the release of these annual financial statements  the spot price of canadian low gravity oil increased to levels such that forest s canadian cost center ceiling exceeded its capitalized costs 
as such  no impairment adjustment to the canadian cost center was necessary as of december  in countries or areas where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs  and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion  and amortization  and the application of the ceiling limitation 
if exploration efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves and exploration activities cease  the amounts accumulated as unproved costs are charged against earnings as impairments 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned  and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis under the successful efforts method 
impairments are assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
in general  the application of the full cost method of accounting results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to the successful efforts method 
the full cost method is used to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities  because we believe it appropriately reports the costs of our exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides guidance under fasb statement of accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
we continue to evaluate the impact of the repatriation provisions 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  we have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june   supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r also requires the tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may serve to reduce forest s future cash provided by operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities  to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future 
we are required to adopt sfas r in our third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost  and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r  and we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas forest has an employee stock purchase plan the espp that allows eligible employees to annually purchase the company s common stock at a discount 
the provisions of sfas r will cause the espp to be a compensatory plan 
however  the change in accounting for the espp is not expected to have a material impact on forest s financial position  future results of operations  or liquidity 
historically  the espp compensatory amounts have been nominal 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the espp 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect it to have a material impact 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
regarding the application of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  by oil and gas producing entities that follow the full cost accounting method 
sab no 
 effective in the fourth quarter of  states that after adoption of sfas no 
 the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet should be excluded from the present value of estimated future net cash flows used for the full cost ceiling test calculation 
forest has accounted for its asset retirement obligations in this manner since the adoption of sfas no 
and  therefore  sab no 
will have no effect on the company s financial statements or its ceiling test computation 
forward looking statements the information in this form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements  other than statements of historical facts or present facts  that address activities  events  outcomes  and other matters that forest plans  expects  intends  assumes  believes  budgets  predicts  forecasts  projects  estimates  or anticipates and other similar expressions will  should  or may occur in the future are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on management s current belief  based on currently available information  as to the outcome and timing of future events 
when considering forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described below  under the heading risk factors 
these forward looking statements appear in a number of places and include statements with respect to  among other things estimates of our oil and gas reserves  estimates of our future natural gas and liquids production  including estimates of any increases in oil and gas production  planned capital expenditures and availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures  our outlook on oil and gas prices  the impact of political and regulatory developments  our future financial condition or results of operations and our future revenues and expenses  and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
we caution you that these forward looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  incident to the exploration for and development  production  and sale of oil and gas 
these risks include  but are not limited to  commodity price volatility  inflation  lack of availability of goods and services  environmental risks  drilling and other operating risks  regulatory changes  the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  and the other risks described under the caption risk factors 
the financial results of our foreign operations are also subject to currency exchange rate risks 
reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data  the interpretation of such data  and price and cost assumptions made by our reservoir engineers 
in addition  the results of drilling  testing  and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously 
if significant  such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this form k occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements  expressed or implied  included in this form k and attributable to forest are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
this cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward looking statements that forest or persons acting on its behalf may issue 
forest does not undertake to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of filing this form k with the securities and exchange commission  except as required by law 
risk factors oil and gas price declines could adversely affect forest s revenue  cash flows  and profitability 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely 
forest s revenues  profitability  and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
increases and decreases in prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow from banks may be subject to redetermination based on changes in prices 
in addition  we may have ceiling test writedowns when prices decline 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that forest can produce economically 
any substantial or extended decline in the prices of or demand for oil and natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices 
factors that can cause price fluctuations include relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  particularly those in the middle east  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of oil and gas imports  or general economic conditions 
we may not be able to obtain adequate financing to execute our operating strategy 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity needs through the use of bank credit facilities  cash provided by operating activities  and the issuance of debt and equity securities when market conditions permit 
we continue to examine alternative sources of long term capital such as bank borrowings or the issuance of debt securities  the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities  sales of properties  the issuance of non recourse production based financing or net profits interests  sales of prospects and technical information  and joint venture financing 
the availability of these sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include general economic and financial market conditions  oil and natural gas prices  and the value and performance of forest 
we may be unable to execute our operating strategy if we cannot obtain capital from these sources 
availability under our bank credit facility is based on a global borrowing base that is redetermined semi annually  and may be redetermined at other times during a year at the option of the company or the lenders 
the global borrowing base may be reduced if oil and gas prices decline or we have downward revisions in our estimate of proved reserves 
see leverage will materially affect our operations  below 
in addition  if availability under our credit facilities is reduced as a result of a borrowing base limitation or the covenants and financial tests contained in the agreements  our ability to fund our planned capital expenditures could be adversely affected 
after utilizing our available sources of financing  we could be forced to raise additional debt or equity proceeds to fund such expenditures 
we cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet these requirements 
a curtailment of capital spending could adversely affect our ability to replace production and our future cash flow from operations 
estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
estimating our proved reserves involves many uncertainties  including factors beyond our control 
petroleum engineers consider many factors and make assumptions in estimating oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows 
lower oil and gas prices generally cause lower estimates of proved reserves 
ultimately  actual production  revenues  and expenditures relating to our reserves will vary from any estimates  and these variations may be material 
also  we may revise estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
see note  items d and f  to the consolidated financial statements  below  for further discussion of a downward revision of our reserves in we could incur writedowns of our united states and canadian full cost pools under ceiling test limitations pursuant to full cost accounting as a result of lower oil and gas spot prices in the future or downward future reserve revisions 
if we were to record writedowns  shareholders equity could be reduced significantly 
also  you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this form k is the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual current and future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the sec net present value estimate  and as a result  net present value estimates using actual prices and costs may be significantly less than the sec estimate that is provided in this form k 
leverage will materially affect our operations 
as of december   the principal amount of our long term debt was approximately million  including approximately million outstanding under our global bank credit facilities 
our long term debt represented of our total capitalization at december  further  we may incur additional debt in the future  including in connection with acquisitions and refinancings 
the level of our debt could have several important effects on our future operations  including  among others a significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be applied to the payment of principal and interest on the debt and will not be available for other purposes  credit rating agencies have changed  and may continue to change  their ratings of our debt and other obligations as a result of changes in our debt level  financial condition  earnings  and cash flow  such ratings changes would in turn impact the costs  terms  conditions  and availability of financing  covenants contained in our existing and future credit and debt arrangements will require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business  including possible acquisition opportunities  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate  and other purposes may be limited or burdened by increased costs or more restrictive covenants  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to similar companies that have less debt  and our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions may increase 
lower oil and gas prices may cause us to record ceiling limitation writedowns 
we use the full cost method of accounting to report our oil and gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for  and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit  which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling test writedown 
this charge would not impact cash flow from operating activities  but it would reduce our shareholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our undeveloped property values  or if estimated future development costs increase 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience ceiling test writedowns in the future 
our canadian full cost pool  in particular  could be adversely impacted by moderate declines in commodity prices 
we may incur significant abandonment costs or be required to post substantial performance bonds in connection with the plugging and abandonment of wells  platforms  and pipelines 
we are responsible for the costs associated with the plugging of wells  the removal of facilities and equipment  and site restoration on our oil and gas properties  pro rata to our working interest 
future liabilities for projected abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values  are included as a reduction in the future cash flows from our reserves in our reserve reporting 
as of december   our estimated discounted asset retirement obligation liability recorded in the balance sheet was approximately million  primarily for properties in offshore gulf of mexico and the cook inlet of alaska 
approximately million of abandonment costs were settled in and million of abandonment costs are anticipated to be settled in  all of which are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 
estimates of abandonment costs and their timing may change due to many factors  including actual drilling and production results  inflation rates  changes in abandonment techniques and technology  and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
many gulf of mexico reservoirs experience high decline rates  while the decline rates in long lived fields in other regions are lower 
production from the offshore gulf coast reservoirs represented approximately of our total production in our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
forest s future natural gas and oil production is highly dependent upon its level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing  or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development  and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and gas drilling and production activities 
oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain 
oil and gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed  or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  geological irregularities or pressure in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions  shortages in labor  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment  and failure to secure necessary regulatory approvals and permits 
the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment  and related services 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
we may not be insured against all of the operating risk to which our business is exposed 
the exploration  development  and production of oil and natural gas involves risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pipe failure  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  gas leaks  pipeline ruptures  or discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources  and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  and suspension of operations 
for example  a substantial portion of our oil and gas operations is located offshore in the gulf of mexico 
the gulf of mexico area experiences tropical weather disturbances  some of which can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be fully adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
our international operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations and economic and political developments 
we have significant oil and gas operations in canada 
the expenses and revenues of such operations  which represented approximately of consolidated costs of oil and gas operations  and of our consolidated oil and gas revenues in  are denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result  the profitability of our canadian operations is subject to the risk of fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian and united states dollars 
we have also acquired additional oil and gas assets in other countries 
although there are no material operations in these countries  our foreign operations may also be adversely affected by political and economic developments  royalty and tax increases  and other laws or policies in these countries  as well as united states policies affecting trade  taxation  and investment in other countries 
in south africa we have an interest in offshore properties with the potential for gas production 
no proved reserves have been assigned to these properties as commercial sales contracts have not been established 
if we are unable to arrange for commercial use of these properties  we may not be able to recoup our investment and will not realize our anticipated financial and operating results from these properties 
hedging transactions may limit our potential gains 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas  we enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
our hedges are limited in duration  usually for periods of one year or less 
however  in connection with acquisitions  sometimes our hedges are for longer periods 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains if oil and gas prices rise over the price established by the arrangements 
in trying to maintain an appropriate balance  we may end up hedging too much or too little  depending upon how oil or natural gas prices fluctuate in the future 
in addition  hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our future contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
we cannot assure you that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices 
for further information concerning prices  market conditions  and energy swap and collar agreements  see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk of this form k  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition within our industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
forest competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in acquiring desirable oil and gas properties and in obtaining the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
forest also competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
our growth may partially depend on our ability to acquire oil and gas properties on a profitable basis 
acquisition of producing oil and gas properties is a key element of maintaining and growing reserves and production 
competition for these assets has been and will continue to be intense 
the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors  including the purchase price  future oil and gas prices  the ability to reasonably estimate or assess the recoverable volumes of reserves  rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves  future operating and capital costs  results of future exploration  exploitation and development activities on the acquired properties  and future abandonment and possible future environmental liabilities 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves  actual future production rates  and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets 
actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
our oil and gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and gas operations are subject to various united states federal  state  and local and canadian federal and provincial governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and gas production 
in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas  these agencies may restrict the rates of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity 
in addition  the federal oil pollution act opa  as amended  requires operators of offshore facilities to prove that they have the financial capability to respond to costs that may be incurred in connection with potential oil spills 
under the opa and other federal and state environmental statutes  owners and operators of certain defined facilities are strictly liable for such spills of oil and other regulated substances  subject to certain limitations 
a substantial spill from one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  competitive position  or financial condition 
united states and non united states laws regulate production  handling  storage  transportation  and disposal of oil and gas  by products from oil and gas  and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
although we operate the properties from which most of our production is derived  other companies operate some of our other properties 
we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund for their operation 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could have a material adverse effect on the realization of our targeted returns or lead to unexpected future costs 
our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws have provisions that discourage corporate takeovers 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of the new york business corporation law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
our directors are elected to staggered terms 
also  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval and to set the rights  preferences  and other designations  including voting rights of those shares as the board may determine 
additional provisions include restrictions on business combinations  the availability of authorized but unissued common stock  and notice requirements for shareholder proposals and director nominations 
these provisions  alone or in combination with each other and with the rights plan described below  may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan 
if activated  the plan would cause extreme dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire a significant interest in forest without advance approval of our board of directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil  and natural gas liquids for our own account in the united states and canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
hedging program in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in prices  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we make use of an oil and gas hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  we enter into commodity swaps  collars  and other financial instruments with counterparties who  in general  are participants in our credit facilities 
these arrangements  which are based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
hedging arrangements covered   and of our consolidated production  on an equivalent basis  during the years ended december    and  respectively 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
swaps in a typical commodity swap agreement  forest receives the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower than the fixed price 
if the index price is higher  forest pays the difference 
by entering into swap agreements  we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis 
as of december   forest had entered into the following swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges natural gas nymex hh oil nymex wti bbtu per day weighted average hedged price per mmbtu barrels per day weighted average hedged price per bbl first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  collars forest also enters into collar agreements with third parties 
a collar agreement is similar to a swap agreement  except that we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price only if the index price is below the floor price  and we pay the difference between the ceiling price and the index price only if the index price is above the ceiling price 
collars are also settled in cash  either on a monthly basis or at the end of their terms 
by entering into collars  we effectively provide a floor for the price that we will receive for the hedged production  however  the collar also establishes a maximum price that we will receive for the hedged production if prices increase above the ceiling price 
we enter into collars during periods of volatile commodity prices in order to protect against a significant decline in prices in exchange for foregoing the benefit of price increases in excess of the ceiling price on the hedged production 
as of december   forest had entered into the following gas and oil collars accounted for as cash flow hedges natural gas nymex hh bbtu per day weighted average hedged floor price per mmbtu weighted average hedged ceiling price per mmbtu first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter oil nymex wti barrels per day weighted average hedged floor price per bbl weighted average hedged ceiling price per bbl first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  in addition  forest has entered into three way collars with third parties 
these instruments establish two floors and one ceiling 
upon settlement  if the index price is below the lowest floor  we receive the difference between the two floors 
if the index price is between the two floors  we receive the difference between the higher of the two floors and the index price 
if the index price is between the higher floor and the ceiling  we do not receive or pay any additional amounts 
if the index price is above the ceiling  we pay the excess over the ceiling price

long term sales contracts a portion of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold in a joint venture with other producers the canadian netback pool 
the canadian netback pool s resale markets are comprised of market based and fixed price contracts 
canadian forest s average daily production sold through the canadian netback pool represented approximately of forest s total average daily production in canadian forest supplied of the canadian netback pool sales quantity in  and it is estimated that canadian forest will supply of the canadian netback pool quantity in the contract year 
we expect that canadian forest s pro rata obligations as a gas producer will increase in and future years 
at december   the weighted average price paid under the resale contracts was approximately of market value based on the closing aeco prices on that date 
to the extent the canadian netback pool s supply is insufficient to meet the delivery obligations under the resale contracts  as is currently the case  the canadian netback pool must make up the shortfall by purchasing spot market gas at prices that currently exceed the prices paid under the resale contracts 
this shortfall could increase if individual producers were to default on their supply obligations owed to the canadian netback pool 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in several foreign currencies and thus are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing  and investing transactions 
in the past  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
expenditures incurred relative to the foreign concessions held by forest outside of north america have been primarily united states dollar denominated  as have cash proceeds related to property sales and farmout arrangements 
substantially all of our canadian revenues and costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to the us dollar  we believe that any currency risk associated with our canadian operations would not have a material impact on our results of operations
