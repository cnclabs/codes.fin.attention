as a result of the settlement volume  the company recorded additional pension expense of million during the year ended january  critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
issued by the securities and exchange commission requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by the company 
the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere herein  should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the critical accounting policies and most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  insurance reserves  recoverability of accounts receivable  income tax valuation allowances and pension and post retirement medical and life insurance benefits expense 
actual amounts could differ significantly from the estimates 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are derived primarily from the operation of full service restaurants  the distribution and sale of premium ice cream desserts through retail and institutional locations and franchising 
the company recognizes restaurant revenue upon receipt of payment from the customer and retail revenue  net of discounts and allowances  upon delivery of product 
reserves for discounts and allowances from retail sales trade promotions are estimated and accrued when revenue is recorded based on promotional planners prepared by the company s retail sales force 
due to the high volume of trade promotion activity and the difficulty of coordinating trade promotion pricing with its customers  differences between the company s accrual and the subsequent settlement amount occur frequently 
usually these differences are individually insignificant 
to address the financial impact of these differences  the company s estimating methodology takes these smaller differences into account 
the company believes its methodology has been reasonably reliable in recording trade promotion accruals 
the accrual for future trade promotion settlements as of january  and december  was million and million  respectively 
a variation of five percent in the accrual would change retail sales by approximately  franchise royalty income  generally calculated as of net sales of franchisees  is recorded monthly based upon the actual sales reported by each franchisee for the month just completed 
franchise fees are recorded as revenue upon completion of all significant services  generally upon opening of the restaurant 
insurance reserves the company is self insured through retentions or deductibles for the majority of its workers compensation  automobile  general liability  employer s liability  product liability and group health insurance programs 
self insurance amounts vary up to million per occurrence 
insurance with third parties  some of which is then reinsured through restaurant insurance corporation ric  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  is in place for claims in excess of these self insured amounts 
ric reinsures of the risk from million to million per occurrence through september  for ficc s workers compensation  general liability  employer s liability and product liability insurance 
subsequent to september   the company discontinued its use of ric as a captive insurer for new claims 
the company s liabilities for estimated ultimate losses for workers compensation  automobile  general liability  employer s liability and product liability coverages are actuarially determined and recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis 
the projections of estimated ultimate losses are based on commonly used actuarial procedures 
these procedures take into consideration certain actuarial assumptions or management judgments regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim settlement practices 
while the estimated ultimate losses are reasonable  any actuarial estimate is subject to uncertainty due to the volatility inherent in casualty exposures and changes in the assumptions 
the company s provision for insurance expense reflects estimated amounts for the current year as well as revisions in estimates to prior years 
actual losses could vary significantly from the estimated losses and would have a material affect on the company s insurance expense 
the company records a liability for its group health insurance programs for all estimated unpaid claims based primarily upon loss development analyses derived from actual claim payment experience provided by the company s third party administrators 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially expose the company to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of accounts receivable 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally requires no collateral to secure accounts receivable 
the credit review is based on both financial and non financial factors 
the company maintains a reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on its assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company s reserves have historically been within the range of management s expectations 
pension and post retirement medical and life insurance benefits certain of the company s employees are covered under a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension and post retirement medical and life insurance benefits is dependent upon the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in health care costs 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect the future pension and post retirement medical and life insurance obligations and expense 
the company used a discount rate assumption of  and in the calculation of net periodic pension benefit cost for  and  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic pension cost by million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic pension cost by million 
the company reduced its discount rate assumption to for valuing obligations as of january  from at december   due to the declining interest rate environment 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption from would have increased the january  pension benefit obligation by million and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption from would have decreased the january  pension benefit obligation by million 
for  and  an asset return assumption of  and  respectively  was used in the calculation of net periodic pension cost and the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit cost was based on the market related value of pension plan assets 
a one percentage point decrease in the long term asset return assumption would have increased net periodic pension cost by million and a one percentage point increase in the long term asset return assumption would have decreased net periodic pension cost by million 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company reviews its non friendly marks  which were assigned to the company by hershey in september  for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company recognizes impairment has occurred when the carrying value of the non friendly marks exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the trademarked products 
additionally  the company reviews long lived assets related to each restaurant to be held and used in the business quarterly for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates restaurants using a two year history of cash flow as the primary indicator of potential impairment 
based on the best information available  the company writes down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value  which becomes its new cost basis 
estimated fair market value is based on the company s experience selling similar properties and local market conditions  less costs to sell for properties to be disposed of 
in addition  restaurants scheduled for closing are reviewed for impairment and depreciable lives are adjusted 
the impairment evaluation is based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected terminal value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from these estimates 
during the year ended january   the company determined that the carrying value of a vacant restaurant land parcel and the carrying value of one restaurant property exceeded their estimated fair values less costs to sell 
the carrying values were reduced by an aggregate of  during the year ended december   the company determined that the carrying value of one land parcel exceeded its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
the carrying value was reduced by  leases and deferred straight line rent payable the company leases many of its restaurant properties 
leases are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended  which requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
the lease term used for lease evaluation includes option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
for leases that contain rent escalations  the company records the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and records the difference between the rents paid and the straight line rent as a deferred straight line rent payable 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred utilizing prorated periodic sales targets 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
management records deferred tax assets to the extent it believes there will be sufficient future taxable income to utilize those assets prior to their expiration 
to the extent deferred tax assets may be unable to be utilized  the company records a valuation allowance against the potentially unrealizable amount and records a charge against earnings 
the company records income taxes based on the effective rate expected for the year with any changes in the valuation allowance reflected in the period of change 
as of january  and december   a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  existed related to state nol carryforwards due to restrictions on the usage of state nol carryforwards and short carryforward periods for certain states 
the reduction of the valuation allowance is due to the expiration of many of the carryforwards 
due to ever changing tax laws and income tax rates  significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 
management must also make estimates about the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to offset any deductions related to deferred tax assets currently recorded 
accordingly  management believes estimates related to income taxes are critical 
derivative instruments and hedging agreements the company purchases butter option contracts to minimize the impact of increases in the cost of cream 
when available  options on butter futures are purchased to cover up to of the cream needs of the manufacturing plant 
option contracts are offered in the months of march  may  july  september  october and december  however  there is often not enough open interest in them to allow the company to buy even very limited coverage without paying high premiums 
in addition to hedging  the company pursues fixed price cream contracts to manage dairy cost pressures 
the company was unable to find a supplier interested in an agreement for a fixed price load of cream for part of the year or the full year of and the situation surrounding the supply of cream which depends on milk production  milk per cow  number of cows  butter inventories  etc 
is very uncertain in the wake of the national milk producers federation s cooperatives working together program 
the company s commodity option contracts do not meet hedge accounting criteria as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related amendment  sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and  accordingly  are marked to market each period with the resulting gains or losses recognized in cost of sales 
during  gains of approximately million were included in cost of sales related to these option contracts as compared to losses of approximately million for both and contingencies from time to time the company is named as a defendant in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business 
the company does not believe that the resolutions of these claims will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation for employees under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and elected the disclosure only alternative under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost of approximately million and million related to modified option awards was included in net loss income in and  respectively  for the company s stock option plan and the company s incentive plan 
no stock based compensation cost was recorded in in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  the company will continue to disclose the required pro forma information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than the first interim or annual period beginning after june  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
r on july  using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date 
as of january   there were no awards granted to employees that remain unvested 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the overall financial position 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be determined at this time because it will depend upon levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss income and loss earnings per share pursuant to sfas no 
in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and in  and  respectively 
on december   the company s board of directors approved the vesting of all outstanding and unvested options for the company s stock option plan and the company s incentive plan 
this action was taken to reduce  or eliminate to the extent permitted  the transition expense related to outstanding stock option awards under sfas no 
r 
the  options that were vested included  options with exercise prices greater than the company s closing stock price on the modification date 
under the accounting guidance of apb opinion no 
 the accelerated vesting resulted in stock based compensation cost of approximately  net of related income tax benefit of  which was included in net loss for the year ended january  additionally  the effect of the accelerated vesting in the company s pro forma disclosure note of notes to consolidated financial statements was incremental stock based compensation of approximately million net of related income tax benefit of million 
this stock based compensation expense would otherwise have been recognized in accordance with sfas no 
r in the company s consolidated statements of operations over the next three fiscal years 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter 
the amendments made by sfas no 
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board toward development of a single set of high quality accounting standards 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company has market risk exposure to interest rates on its fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
the company does not enter into contracts for trading purposes 
the information below summarizes the company s market risk associated with its debt obligations as of january  the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by expected year of maturity 
for variable rate debt obligations  the average variable rates are based on implied forward rates as derived from appropriate monthly spot rate observations as of year end 
because the mortgage loans are privately held  the company believes that the carrying value of the mortgage loans as of january  approximated the fair value 
expected year of maturity dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate senior notes   fixed interest rate mortgage loans fixed interest rate variable rate mortgage loans   average interest rates revolving credit loans   average interest rate the company is subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
the company s ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which it operates 
the company manages exposure to this risk primarily through contractual commitments to purchase raw materials  food products and supplies used in the normal course of business 
the majority of the commitments cover periods of one to months 
additionally  on a limited basis  the company occasionally purchases butter option contracts to minimize the impact of increases in the cost of cream 
option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended january  and december  did not significantly impact the company s cost of sales
