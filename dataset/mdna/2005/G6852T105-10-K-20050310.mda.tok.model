item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation cautionary note concerning forward looking statements certain statements contained in this document  including management s discussion and analysis  may be considered forward looking statements as defined in section a of the united states securities act of and section e of the united states securities exchange act of forward looking statements are made based upon management s assumptions and expectations concerning the potential effect on the company of future events and financial performance and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to significant business  economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward looking statements 
partnerre s forward looking statements could be affected by numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events and developments such as the following risks related to our company the following review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that are included herein or elsewhere 
the words believe  anticipate  estimate  project  plan  expect  intend  hope  forecast  evaluate  will likely result or will continue or words of similar impact generally involve forward looking statements 
we caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of their dates 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the volatility of the business that we underwrite may result in volatility of our earnings and limit our ability to write future business 
catastrophe reinsurance comprises approximately of our net premiums written 
catastrophe losses result from events such as windstorms  hurricanes  earthquakes  floods  hail  tornadoes  severe winter weather  fires  explosions and other man made or natural disasters  the incidence and severity of which are inherently unpredictable 
because catastrophe reinsurance accumulates large aggregate exposures to man made and natural disasters  our loss experience in this line of business could be characterized as low frequency and high severity  particularly since we usually provide reinsurance that pays only after the primary insurer has experienced a specified level of loss  which tends to reduce our exposure to higher frequency  lower severity losses 
this is likely to result in substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and may create downward pressure on the market price of our common shares and limit our ability to make dividend payments and payments on our debt securities 
we write other lines of business that can be affected by large losses  including property  agriculture  motor  casualty  marine  aviation space  credit surety  other lines  life annuity and health 
the company also provides derivative and insurance reinsurance solutions for complex financial risks that can also result in large losses 
major loss events we have experienced in the last three years include losses of million resulting from the september terrorist attack  million from the european floods that occurred during the third quarter of  and million from the atlantic hurricanes in the third quarter of we endeavor to manage our exposure to catastrophe and other large losses by attempting to limit our aggregate exposure on catastrophe reinsurance in any particular geographic zone defined by us and attempting to limit our exposure to per risk reinsurance  selective underwriting practices  diversification of risks by geographic area and by lines and classes of business  and to a certain extent by purchasing retrocessional reinsurance 

table of contents notwithstanding the foregoing  the effect of a single catastrophic event or series of events affecting one or more geographic zones  or changes in the relative frequency or severity of catastrophic or other large loss events  could reduce our earnings and limit the funds available to make payments on future claims 
the effect of an increase in frequency of mid size losses in any one reporting period affecting one or more geographic zones  such as an unusual level of hurricane activity  could also reduce our earnings 
should we incur a substantial catastrophe loss  our ability to write future business may be adversely impacted 
if actual losses exceed our estimated loss reserves our net income will be reduced 
our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we reinsure 
we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the contracts that we write 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
loss reserves are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time to reflect our expectations of the costs of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims 
losses for short tailed business  which include most types of property catastrophe losses property  motor  physical damage  aviation hull  marine  etc  tend to be reported promptly and settled within a short period of time 
however  losses for casualty and liability lines  which business we are currently growing  often take longer to discover  and frequently can be impacted by lengthy  unpredictable litigation and by the inflation of loss costs generally over time 
we expect our casualty business to produce claims that frequently will be resolved only through lengthy and unpredictable litigation 
the measures required to resolve such claims  including the adjudication process  present more reserve challenges than property related losses which tend to be reported more promptly than casualty claims and to be settled more often within a relatively shorter period of time 
as a consequence of litigation in all of our lines of business  actual claims and claim expenses paid may substantially deviate from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
as a result  even when losses are identified and reserves are established for any line of business  ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses that is  the administrative costs of managing and settling claims paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from estimates reflected in loss reserves in our financial statements 
if our loss reserves for business written are inadequate  we will be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which we identify the deficiency 
this could cause a material increase in our liabilities  a reduction in our profitability and a reduction of capital 
under us gaap  we are not permitted to establish loss reserves with respect to our catastrophe reinsurance until an event that may give rise to a claim occurs 
although we did not operate prior to  we assumed certain asbestos and environmental exposures through our acquisitions 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses include an estimate of our ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims for which we cannot estimate the ultimate value using traditional reserving techniques  and for which there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of our potential losses 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have received and continue to receive notices of potential reinsurance claims from ceding insurance companies which have in turn received claims asserting asbestos and environmental losses under primary insurance policies  in part reinsured by us 
such claims notices are often precautionary in nature and generally are unspecific  and the primary insurers often do not attempt to quantify the amount  timing or nature of the exposure 
given the lack of specificity in some of these notices  and the legal and tort environment that affects the development of claims reserves  the uncertainties inherent in valuing asbestos and environmental claims are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
in addition  the reserves that we have established may be inadequate 
if ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses exceed the reserves currently established  we will be required to increase loss reserves in the period in which the deficiency is identified to cover any such claims 
this could cause a material increase in our liabilities  a reduction in our profitability and a reduction of capital 

table of contents we could face unanticipated losses from man made catastrophic events and these or other unanticipated losses could impair our financial condition  reduce our profitability and decrease the market price of our shares 
we may have substantial exposure to unexpected  large losses resulting from future man made catastrophic events  such as acts of terrorism  acts of war and political instability  or from other perils 
although we may exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverage written by us  we may continue to have exposure to such unforeseen or unpredictable events 
it is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate 
under us gaap  we are not permitted to establish reserves for potential losses associated with man made or other catastrophic events until an event that may give rise to such losses occurs 
if such an event were to occur  our reported income would decrease in the affected period 
in particular  unforeseen large losses could reduce our profitability or impair our financial condition 
over time  if the severity and frequency of these events remains higher than in the past  it may impact our ability to write future business 
emerging claim and coverage issues could adversely affect our business 
unanticipated developments in the law as well as changes in social and environmental conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance  reinsurance and other contracts 
these developments and changes may materially adversely affect us 
for example  we could be subject to developments that impose additional coverage obligations on us beyond our underwriting intent  or to increases in the number or size of claims to which we are subject 
with respect to our casualty businesses  these legal  social and environmental changes may not become apparent until some time after their occurrence 
our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by an increase in insurance and reinsurance contract disputes  arbitration  and litigation 
the full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under our coverages  and in particular our casualty reinsurance contracts  may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
in addition  we could be adversely affected by the growing trend of plaintiffs targeting participants in the property liability insurance industry in purported class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices 
changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results 
unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require considerable additional expense to comply  including if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively 
the impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income  which would impact overall earnings 
since we rely on a few reinsurance brokers for a large percentage of our business  loss of business provided by these brokers could reduce our premium volume and net income 
we produce our business both through brokers and through direct relationships with insurance company clients 
for the year ended december   approximately of gross premiums were produced through brokers 
in  we had one broker that accounted for or more of our gross premiums written 
this broker accounted for of gross premiums written 
because broker produced business is concentrated with a small number of brokers  we are exposed to concentration risk 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business produced by significant brokers could significantly reduce our premium volume and net income 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to our reinsurance brokers and cedants and other counterparties 
in accordance with industry practice  we may pay amounts owed under our policies to brokers  and they in turn pay these amounts to the ceding insurer 
in some jurisdictions  if the broker fails to make such an onward 
table of contents payment  we might remain liable to the ceding insurer for the deficiency 
conversely  the ceding insurer will pay premiums to the broker  for onward payment to us in respect of reinsurance policies issued by us 
in certain jurisdictions  these premiums are considered to have been paid to us at the time that payment is made to the broker  and the ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
we may not be able to collect all premiums receivable due from any particular broker at any given time 
we also assume credit risk by writing business on a funds withheld basis 
under such arrangements the cedant retains the premium they would otherwise pay to the reinsurer to cover future loss payments 
in addition  we may be exposed to credit risk from transactions involving derivative counterparties and the credit risk of reinsurers from whom we may purchase retrocessional reinsurance 
if we are downgraded by rating agencies  our standing with brokers and customers could be negatively impacted and our premiums and earnings could decrease 
third party rating agencies assess and rate the claims paying ability and financial strength of insurers and reinsurers  such as the company s subsidiaries  partner reinsurance company ltd 
partner reinsurance  partner reinsurance company of the us partnerre us and partnerre sa 
these ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies  and the rating agencies will periodically evaluate our reinsurance operations to confirm that we continue to meet the criteria of the ratings that have been assigned to us 
the claims paying ability ratings assigned by rating agencies to reinsurance or insurance companies are based upon factors and criteria established independently by each rating agency  and are not an evaluation directed to investors in our common shares  preferred shares or debt securities and are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold our common shares  preferred shares or debt securities 
rating agencies may downgrade or withdraw their ratings in the future if we do not continue to meet the then current criteria of the ratings previously assigned to us 
if these ratings are significantly downgraded by one or more categories  our competitive position in the reinsurance industry may suffer  and it may be more difficult for us to market our products 
certain business that we write contains terms that give the ceding company or derivative counterparties the right to terminate cover and or require collateral if our ratings are downgraded 
a downgrade could result in a significant reduction in the number of reinsurance insurance and derivative contracts we write and in a substantial loss of business as client companies  and brokers that place our business  move to other competitors with higher ratings 
the exposure of our investments to interest rate  credit and market risks may limit our net investment income and net income 
we invest the net premiums we receive until such time as we pay out losses 
investment results comprise a substantial portion of our income 
for the year ended december   we had net investment income of million  which represented approximately of total revenues 
while our management has implemented what it believes to be prudent risk management and investment asset allocation practices  we are exposed to interest rate risks  credit and default risk  liquidity risks and market volatility 
changes in interest rates can negatively affect us in two ways 
in a declining interest rate environment  we will be required to invest our funds at lower rates  which would have a negative impact on investment income 
in a rising interest rate environment  the market value of our fixed income portfolio may decline  thereby reducing our capital and potentially affecting our ability to write business 
our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in high quality  investment grade securities 
however  we invest a smaller portion of the portfolio in below investment grade securities  including high yield bonds  bank loans  and convertible bonds 
these securities  which pay a higher rate of interest  also have a higher degree of credit or default risk 
these securities may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions 
while we have put in place procedures to monitor the credit risk and liquidity of our invested assets  it is possible that  in periods of economic weakness  we may experience default losses in our portfolio 
this may result in a reduction of net income and capital 

table of contents we invest a portion of our portfolio in common stock or equity related securities 
the value of these assets fluctuates with equity markets 
in times of economic weakness  the market value and liquidity of these assets may decline  and may impact net income and capital 
convertible bonds have both a debt and an equity component due to the option to convert the fixed income security to an equity form 
therefore  convertible bonds have both credit and interest rate risk as described above as well as equity volatility risk 
we also invest in alternative investments  which have different risk characteristics than traditional equity and fixed maturity securities 
these alternative investments include hedge fund investments  a european high yield credit fund and private equity partnerships 
our percentage allocation to these alternative investments  which at december   was approximately one percent of our total investment portfolio  will likely increase 
fluctuations in interest rates and exposure to losses in the fixed income and equity portfolios or in our alternative investments may reduce our income in any period or year or cause a significant reduction in our capital 
foreign currency fluctuations may reduce our operating results and our capital levels 
through our multinational reinsurance operations  we conduct business in a variety of foreign non us currencies  the principal exposures being the euro  the british pound  the swiss franc  the canadian dollar and the japanese yen 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates 
our reporting currency is the us dollar  and exchange rate fluctuations relative to the us dollar may materially impact our results and financial position 
we employ various strategies including hedging to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
to the extent that these exposures are not fully hedged or the hedges are ineffective  our results and level of capital may be reduced by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our credit and international swap dealers association isda agreements may limit our financial and operational flexibility which may affect our ability to conduct our business 
we have incurred indebtedness  and may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
additionally  we have entered into credit facilities and isda agreements with various institutions 
under these credit facilities the institutions provide revolving lines of credit to us and our major operating subsidiaries and issue letters of credit to our clients in the ordinary course of business 
the agreements relating to our debt  credit facilities and isda agreements contain various covenants that may limit our ability  among other things  to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
some of these agreements also require us to maintain specified ratings and financial ratios  including a minimum net worth covenant 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet required financial ratios  the lenders or counterparties under these agreements could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them 
if we are in default under the terms of these agreements  then we would also be restricted in our ability to declare or pay any dividends  redeem  purchase or acquire any shares and make a liquidation payment with respect thereto 
if our non us operations become subject to non us taxation  our net income and cash flow will decrease 
we believe that we  partner reinsurance and partnerre sa have operated  and will continue to operate  our respective businesses in a manner that will not cause us to be viewed as engaged in a trade or business in the united states and  on this basis  do not expect that we  partner reinsurance or partnerre sa will be required to pay us corporate income taxes other than potential withholding taxes on certain types of us source passive income 
because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states  the internal revenue service irs may contend that we  partner 
table of contents reinsurance or partnerre sa are engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if we  partner reinsurance or partnerre sa are subject to us income tax  our shareholders equity and earnings will be reduced by the amount of such taxes  which could be material 
partner reinsurance company of the us  partnerre insurance company of new york  partnerre asset management and partnerre new solutions inc are wholly owned subsidiaries of partnerre us corporation  conduct business in the united states and are subject to us corporate income taxes 
we are a holding company and  if our subsidiaries do not make dividend and other payments to us  we may not be able to pay dividends or make payments on our debt securities and other obligations 
we are a holding company with no operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
we rely primarily on cash dividends and payments from partner reinsurance  partnerre sa and partnerre us to pay the operating expenses  shareholder dividends and other obligations of the holding company that may arise from time to time 
we expect future dividends and other permitted payments from these subsidiaries to be our principal source of funds to pay expenses and dividends 
the payment of dividends by our reinsurance subsidiaries to us is limited under bermuda and french law and certain insurance statutes of various us states in which partnerre us is licensed to transact business 
our reinsurance subsidiaries may not always be able to  or may not  pay dividends to us sufficient to pay our operating expenses  shareholder dividends or our other obligations 
the payment of dividends by partner reinsurance to us is limited under bermuda law and regulations 
under the insurance act and amendments thereto  including the insurance amendment act  and related regulations  partner reinsurance is prohibited from paying dividends in any one calendar year of more than of its statutory capital and surplus as of the beginning of such year  unless it files an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio requirements  and from declaring or paying any dividends without the approval of the bermuda monetary authority if it failed to meet its required margins in the previous fiscal year 
the insurance act requires partner reinsurance to maintain a minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio and prohibits dividends that would result in a breach of these requirements 
in addition  partner reinsurance is prohibited under the insurance act from reducing its statutory capital as of the beginning of any year by more than in any one year without the approval of the bermuda monetary authority 
partnerre sa s ability to pay dividends is subject to french laws and regulations governing french companies generally 
although partnerre sa s ability to pay dividends to us is not restricted under current french laws and regulations specifically applicable to reinsurers  the amount of cash dividends that may be paid in any twelve month period is generally limited to the net after tax profits determined under french accounting and tax rules generated in that twelve month period 
partnerre us may generally pay cash dividends only out of earned statutory surplus 
currently  partnerre us has negative earned surplus and therefore cannot pay dividends without prior regulatory approval 
because we are a holding company  our right  and hence the right of our creditors and shareholders  to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary of ours  upon our liquidation or reorganization or otherwise  is subject to the prior claims of policyholders and creditors of these subsidiaries 
if we cannot obtain work permits or extensions of work permits  we may lose the services of some of our executive committee members 
under bermuda law  non bermudians  other than spouses of bermudians and long term residents  are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a work permit issued by the bermuda government 
a work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that  after proper public advertisement  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian is available who meets the minimum standards for the position 
the bermuda government places a six year term limit on individuals with work permits  subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees 

table of contents as of march  two members of our executive committee require a work permit and are designated key employees by the department of immigration  subject to maintaining our status as a good corporate citizen 
if we lose our status as a good corporate citizen  these members of the executive committee may lose their designation as key employees and may consequently be restricted to the six year term limit 
if these work permits are not renewed  we could lose the services of these members of our executive committee in our bermuda office 
we have imposed various limitations on voting and ownership of our shares  which will limit the ability of investors to acquire more than a certain percentage of our voting shares 
the anti takeover provisions in our bye laws may discourage takeover attempts 
under our bye laws  subject to waiver by our board of directors  no transfer of our common shares or preferred shares is permitted if such transfer would result in a shareholder controlling more than of the voting power of our outstanding shares 
any person controlling more than the specified number of shares will be permitted to dispose of any shares purchased which violate the restriction 
if we become aware of such ownership  our bye laws provide that the voting rights with respect to shares directly or indirectly beneficially or constructively owned by any person so owning more than of the voting power of the outstanding shares  including our common shares and preferred shares  will be limited to of the voting power 
the voting rights with respect to all shares held by such person in excess of the limitation will be allocated to the other holders of shares  pro rata based on the number of shares held by all such other holders of shares  subject only to the further limitation that no shareholder allocated any such voting rights may exceed the limitation as a result of such allocation 
our bye laws also contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  meaning that the members of only one of three classes of our directors are elected each year  and could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
for example  these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging change in management and takeover attempts in the future 
investors may encounter difficulties in service of process and enforcement of judgments against us in the united states 
we are a bermuda company and certain of our officers and directors are residents of various jurisdictions outside the united states 
all  or a substantial portion  of the assets of our officers and directors and of our assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
although we have appointed an agent and irrevocably agreed that it may be served with process in new york with respect to actions against us arising out of violations of the united states federal securities law in any federal or state court in the united states  it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states  or to enforce against us or our directors and officers judgments of a united states court predicated upon civil liability provisions of united states federal securities laws 
there is no treaty in force between the united states and bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
as a result  whether a united states judgment would be enforceable in bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the united states court that entered the judgment is recognized by the bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers  as determined by reference to bermuda conflict of law rules 
a judgment debt from a united states court that is final and for a sum certain based on united states federal securities laws will not be enforceable in bermuda unless the judgment debtor had submitted to the jurisdiction of the united states court  and the issue of submission and jurisdiction is a matter of bermuda not united states law 

table of contents in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues  bermuda courts will not enforce a united states federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to public policy 
an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law  the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction  power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity  will not be entered by a bermuda court 
certain remedies available under the laws of united states jurisdictions  including certain remedies under united states federal securities laws  would not be available under bermuda law or enforceable in a bermuda court  as they would be contrary to bermuda public policy 
further  no claim can be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of united states federal securities laws because these laws have no extra jurisdictional effect under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
risks related to our industry our profitability is affected by the cyclical nature of the reinsurance industry 
historically  the reinsurance industry has experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition  levels of available capacity  trends in cash flows and losses  general economic conditions and other factors 
demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results of primary insurers  including catastrophe losses  and prevailing general economic conditions 
the supply of reinsurance is related directly to prevailing prices and levels of capacity that  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being realized in the reinsurance industry 
if any of these factors were to result in a decline in the demand for reinsurance or an overall increase in reinsurance capacity  our profitability could decrease 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete with a number of worldwide reinsurance companies  including  but not limited to  swiss re  munich re  everest re group ltd  transatlantic reinsurance company  berkshire hathaway s general re  the erc group s employers re  lloyds  axa group  hannover re and platinum underwriters and reinsurance operations of certain primary insurance companies  such as ace limited  xl capital and axis capital 
competition in the types of reinsurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors  including the perceived financial strength of the reinsurer  premium charges  other terms and conditions offered  services provided  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines of reinsurance to be written 
some competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources and higher credit ratings than ours 
political  regulatory and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business 
increasingly  governmental authorities in both the us and worldwide are examining the potential risks posed by the reinsurance industry as a whole  and to commercial and financial systems in general 
while we do not believe these inquiries have identified meaningful new risks posed by the reinsurance industry to the financial system or to policyholders  and we cannot predict the exact nature  timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives  we believe it is likely there will be increased regulation in our industry in the future 
for example  in response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets resulting from  among other things  the september th tragedy  the terrorism risk insurance act of tria was enacted to ensure the availability of commercial insurance coverage for terrorist acts in the us this law established a federal assistance program through the end of to help the commercial property and casualty 
table of contents insurance industry cover claims related to future terrorism related losses and required that coverage for terrorist acts be offered by insurers 
it is possible that tria will not be renewed at the end of we are currently unable to determine with certainty the impact that tria s non renewal could have on us 
current legal and regulatory activities relating to the insurance industry  including investigations into contingent commission arrangements and certain finite risk or non traditional insurance products could affect our business and our industry 
recently  the insurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of current litigation  investigations and regulatory activity by various insurance  governmental and enforcement authorities concerning certain practices within the insurance industry 
these practices include the payment of contingent commissions by insurance companies to insurance brokers and agents and the extent to which such compensation has been disclosed  the solicitation and provision of fictitious or inflated quotes and the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or other non traditional or loss mitigation insurance and reinsurance products 
at this time  we are unable to predict the potential effects  if any  that these investigations may have upon the insurance and reinsurance markets and industry business practices or what  if any  changes may be made to laws and regulations regarding the industry and financial reporting 
any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business 
operational risks  including human or systems failures  are inherent in our business 
operational risk and losses can result from fraud  errors by employees  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements  information technology failures  or external events 
we believe our modeling  underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our business 
moreover  our technology and applications have been an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our technology or applications will continue to operate as intended 
a major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in management distraction  harm to our reputation  or increased expense 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation actions are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls  information technology and application systems  but if such controls and actions are not effective  the adverse effect on our business could be significant 
regulatory constraints may restrict our ability to operate our business 
our reinsurance operations are carried out through three main subsidiaries  partner reinsurance in bermuda which also operates branches in switzerland  singapore  labuan and hong kong and representative offices in mexico and chile  partnerre us in greenwich  connecticut and partnerre sa in paris 
partnerre sa also operates a branch in canada and representative offices in tokyo and south korea 
thus  our reinsurance operations are subject to certain insurance laws in each of these jurisdictions 
our bermuda based reinsurance subsidiary  partner reinsurance  is not admitted to do business in the united states 
the insurance laws of each state of the united states regulate the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdiction by foreign insurers  such as partner reinsurance  which are not admitted to do business within such jurisdiction 
partner reinsurance does not intend to maintain an office or to solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other insurance or reinsurance activities in any state of the united states where the conduct of such activities would require that partner reinsurance be so admitted 
accordingly  partner reinsurance does not believe that it is  or will be  in violation of insurance laws of any state in the united states 
however  inquiries or challenges relating to the activities of partner reinsurance or other of our subsidiaries may be raised in the 
table of contents future 
in addition  partner reinsurance s location  regulatory status or restriction on its activities resulting from its regulatory status may limit its ability to conduct business 
in general  the statutes and regulations applicable to partner reinsurance are less restrictive than those that would be applicable if it were subject to the insurance laws of any state in the united states 
the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework has been subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including europe and the united states and various states within the united states 
it is not possible to predict the future impact of changing laws or regulations on our operations  and any such changes may limit the way we conduct our business 
our main subsidiaries regulatory environments are described as follows bermuda 
partner reinsurance is a registered class bermuda insurance and reinsurance company 
among other matters  bermuda statutes  regulations and policies of the bermuda monetary authority require partner reinsurance to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital  surplus and liquidity  to meet solvency standards  to obtain prior approval of ownership and transfer of shares and to submit to certain periodic examinations of its financial condition 
these statutes and regulations may in effect restrict partner reinsurance s ability to write insurance and reinsurance policies  to make certain investments and to distribute funds 
partner reinsurance does not maintain a principal office  and intends to conduct its business such that its personnel do not solicit  advertise  settle claims or conduct other activities to the extent that these activities would constitute the transaction of the business of insurance or reinsurance  in any jurisdiction in which it is not licensed or otherwise not authorized to engage in such activities 
although partner reinsurance does not believe it is or will be in violation of insurance laws or regulations of any jurisdiction outside bermuda  inquiries or challenges to partner reinsurance s insurance or reinsurance activities may still be raised in the future 
united states of america 
partnerre us is organized and domiciled in the state of new york and  as a result  is subject to new york law and regulation under the supervision of the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york 
the purpose of the state insurance regulatory statutes is to protect us insureds and us ceding insurance companies  not our shareholders 
among other matters  state insurance regulations require partnerre us to maintain minimum levels of capital  surplus and liquidity  require partnerre us to comply with applicable risk based capital requirements and impose restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions 
these statutes and regulations may  in effect  restrict the ability of partnerre us to write new business or distribute assets to partnerre ltd 
in recent years  the us insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies and holding companies 
moreover  the national association of insurance commissioners  which is an association of the insurance commissioners of all states and the district of columbia  and state insurance regulators regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations 
changes in these laws and regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
switzerland 
partner reinsurance operates a branch in switzerland and as such  the regulations in bermuda apply to this branch 
this branch is not regulated specifically in switzerland  but global reinsurance regulations could be introduced which could result in a changed regulatory environment and may impact how we do business 
france 
partnerre sa is subject to regulations in france and the eu 
there are regulations about to be made applicable to french reinsurers that dictate investment portfolio contents and solvency ratios 
there are further regulatory moves to reconcile the regulations applicable to insurance companies to reinsurance companies 
we believe these regulations will become more robust over time 
these new regulations and statutes may over time restrict partnerre sa s ability to write reinsurance business 

table of contents executive overview the company operates on a global basis providing multi line reinsurance capacity to insurance companies 
the company writes all lines of business in virtually all markets worldwide  and differentiates itself through its approach to risk  its strategy to manage risk  and its financial strength 
reinsurance is by its nature a risk assumption business 
the company s philosophy is to assume its clients risks  thereby removing the volatility associated with these risks  and then manage the risks and risk related volatility 
the company s ability to succeed in the risk assumption business is dependent on its ability to accurately analyze and quantify risk  to understand volatility and how risks aggregate or correlate  and to establish the appropriate capital requirements and absolute limits for the risks assumed 
the reinsurance markets have historically been highly cyclical in nature 
the cycle is driven by competition  the amount of capital and capacity in the industry  loss events  and investment returns 
the company s long term strategy to generate shareholder value focuses on broad product and geographic diversification of risks  assuming a greater degree of risk than the market average  managing its capital across its risk portfolio and over the duration of the cycle  transactional excellence  and utilizing internal financial capabilities to achieve superior returns on capital 
the company was first established in as a specialty catastrophe reinsurer 
recognizing the limitations and inherent volatility in writing a single line of business  the company made a strategic shift to diversify its risk portfolio 
the company began pursuing acquisition opportunities  and in acquired french reinsurer safr  and then the following year acquired the reinsurance operations of the winterthur group 
through these acquisitions and organic growth  the company has evolved into a leading multi line reinsurer 
the company writes business from four principal locations bermuda  greenwich connecticut  zurich and paris 
risks reinsured include property  casualty  motor  agriculture  aviation space  catastrophe  credit surety  engineering energy  marine  life annuity and health  and alternative risk transfer solutions 
through its broad product and geographic diversification  its excellent execution capabilities  and its local presence in most major markets  the company is able to respond quickly to market needs  and capitalize on business opportunities virtually anywhere in the world 
today  the company has more than employees and does business in more than countries around the world 
the company writes business through its wholly owned subsidiaries partner reinsurance company ltd  partnerre sa  and partner reinsurance company of the us the parent company  partnerre ltd 
reports on three operating segments non life  which comprises its traditional property and casualty business in the us u 
s property and casualty sub segment and the rest of the world global property and casualty sub segment and its significant specialty lines business worldwide specialty sub segment  life  and alternative risk transfer art 
each segment has its own business units  which are aligned either by market  line of business  or client buying patterns 
the company generates its revenue primarily from premiums 
premium rates and terms and conditions vary by line of business depending on market conditions 
pricing cycles are driven by supply and demand  and the amount of capital in the industry 
the reinsurance business is also influenced by several other factors including variations in interest rates and financial markets  changes in legal  regulatory and judicial environments  loss trends  inflation and general economic conditions 
throughout the late s  the industry s operating profitability and cash flows declined as a result of declining prices  a deterioration in terms and conditions and increasing loss costs 
these negative trends were  however  offset by high investment returns that led to continued growth in capital 
premium rates began to increase in  when the large loss events of that year  including the september tragedy and the enron bankruptcy  in addition to steep declines in interest rates and equity values  added to the pressure for improvements in pricing and underwriting conditions 
in january through the middle of  the company experienced the strongest renewal seasons in over five years 
in the second half of  the company began to see a flattening in the rate of improvements in the terms and conditions of the most profitable lines and a slower rate of improvement in those lines that had not yet reached their peak in terms of profitability 
from the middle of to the end of  this resulted in a slower growth 
table of contents rate in pricing although there was good pricing discipline in the industry 
during the january  renewals the company saw increased competition in the industry  which led to a modest deterioration in prices 
although certain lines  primarily the life business and the us casualty business saw modest rate increases or at least price stability  the majority of lines  including property and short tail specialty lines of business saw rate decreases 
in addition  there were more net retentions by primary insurance companies  and companies discontinuing lines of business altogether 
the deterioration in market conditions that the company has seen  however  has been generally orderly and gradual 
the company expects premium volume will be stable to down approximately during  with a continuation of this trend into the company believes that the industry has reached the peak of the current underwriting profitability cycle 
a key challenge facing the company in the coming years will be to manage through the less profitable portion of the reinsurance industry cycle 
the company is confident in its long term strategy  and believes that by closely monitoring the progression of each line of business  being selective in the business that it writes  and maintaining the diversification of its portfolio  it will continue to optimize returns 
individual lines of business and markets have their own unique characteristics and are at different stages of the reinsurance pricing cycle at any given point in time 
management believes it has achieved appropriate portfolio diversification by product  geography  line and type of business  length of tail  and distribution channel  and that this diversification  in addition to the financial strength of the company  and its strong global franchise  will help to mitigate the decline in underwriting profitability over the next few years 
the company also generates revenue from its substantial and high quality investment portfolio 
the company follows conservative investment guidelines through a strategy that seeks to maximize returns while managing investment risk in line with the company s overall objectives of earnings stability and long term book value growth 
liability funds are used to support the company s net reinsurance liabilities  defined as the company s reinsurance liabilities net of the reinsurance assets  and are matched in size  currency and duration with existing liabilities in the company s underwriting portfolio 
the company invests the liability funds in high quality fixed income securities with the primary objective of preserving liquidity and protecting capital 
capital funds are used to generate shareholder returns and are invested in investment grade and less than investment grade fixed income securities and equity instruments 
in addition to revenues generated from its underwriting operations and investment activities  the company s profitability is also based upon the level of its losses and loss expenses 
the company recognizes losses and loss expenses on the basis of actual and expected claims on business written 
the company s non life net reserve position at december  was billion 
management believes that it follows conservative investing and reserving policies in pursuit of a strong financial position 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to its consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgment 
these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the company s notes to consolidated financial statements for a full understanding of the company s accounting policies 
losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits because a significant amount of time can lapse between the assumption of risk  occurrence of a loss event  the reporting of the event to an insurance company the primary company or the cedant  the subsequent 
table of contents reporting to the reinsurance company the reinsurer and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event by the reinsurer  the company s liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses is based largely upon estimates 
the company categorizes unpaid losses and loss expenses into three types of reserves reported outstanding loss reserves case reserves  additional case reserves acr and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
case reserves represent unpaid losses reported by the company s cedants and recorded by the company 
acr are established for particular circumstances where  on the basis of individual loss reports  the company estimates that the particular loss or collection of losses covered by a treaty may be greater than those advised by the cedant 
ibnr reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company  as well as future loss development on losses already reported  in excess of the case reserves and acr 
unlike case reserves and acr  ibnr reserves are generally calculated in the aggregate for each line of business and they cannot usually be identified as reserves for a particular loss or treaty 
the company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants 
the company also estimates the future unallocated loss expenses associated with the loss reserves ulae and these form part of the company s loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company s non life loss reserves for each category and sub segment are reported in the table later in this section 
the amount of time that elapses before a claim is reported to the cedant and then subsequently reported to the reinsurer is commonly referred to in the industry as the reporting tail 
lines of business for which claims are reported quickly are commonly referred to as short tailed lines  and lines of business for which a longer period of time elapses before claims are reported to the reinsurer are commonly referred to as long tailed lines 
in general  for reinsurance  the time lags are longer than for primary business due to the delay that occurs between the cedant becoming aware of a loss and reporting the information to its reinsurer s 
the delay varies by reinsurance market country of cedant  type of treaty  whether losses are paid by the cedant and the size of the loss 
the delay could vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer 
for both short and long tailed lines  the company s objective is to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses 
total loss reserves are then calculated by subtracting losses paid 
similarly  ibnr reserves are calculated by subtraction of case reserves and acr from total reserves 
the company analyzes its ultimate losses and loss expenses after consideration of the loss experience of various reserving cells 
the losses on each treaty for every underwriting year are assigned to a reserving cell 
an underwriting year is the year during which the reinsurance treaty was entered into as opposed to the year in which the loss occurred accident year  or the calendar year for which financial results are reported 
the reserving cells are selected in order to ensure that the underlying treaties have homogeneous loss development characteristics eg reporting tail but are large enough to make estimation of trends credible 
the selection of reserving cells is reviewed annually and changes over time as the business of the company evolves 
for each reserving cell  the company s estimates of losses and loss expense liabilities are reached after a review of the results of several commonly accepted actuarial projection methodologies 
in selecting its best estimate  the company considers the appropriateness of each methodology to the individual circumstances of the cell and underwriting year for which the projection is made 
the methodologies that the company employs include  but may not be limited to  paid loss development methods  incurred loss development methods  paid borhuetter ferguson methods b f  incurred b f methods  loss ratio methods and bektander methods 
in addition  the company uses other methodologies to estimate liabilities for specific types of claims 
for example  internal and vendor catastrophe models are typically used in the estimation of loss and loss expenses at the early stages of catastrophe losses before loss information is reported to the reinsurer 
in the case of asbestos and environmental claims  the company has established reserves for future loss and allocated loss expenses based on the results of an actuarial study  which considered the underlying exposures of the company s cedants 
the reserve methodologies employed by the company are dependent on data that the company collects 
this data consists primarily of loss amounts reported by the company s cedants  loss payments made by the company s cedants  and premiums written and earned by the company 
the actuarial methods used by the company to project its liabilities recorded today but that will be paid in the future future liabilities do not generally include methodologies that are dependent on claim counts reported  claim counts settled or claim 
table of contents counts open because  due to the nature of the company s business  this information is not routinely provided by the cedants for every treaty 
consequently  actuarial methods relying on this information cannot be used by the company to estimate loss reserves 
the company examines loss development trends by underwriting year to determine various assumptions that are required as inputs in the actuarial methodologies it employs 
these typically involve the analysis of historical loss development trends by reserving cell and by underwriting year  and the calculation of long term averages 
in addition  the company utilizes external or internal benchmark sources of information for the reserving cells for which the company does not have sufficient loss development data to calculate credible trends 
several underlying assumptions are used in the construction of average trends and their subsequent use in the actuarial methodologies we employ 
the validity of these underlying assumptions is reviewed periodically and if appropriate  modifications are made in the selection of average trends or other reserving inputs to reflect deviations from the underlying assumptions 
critical underlying assumptions are i the cedant s business practices will proceed as in the past with no material changes either in submission of accounts or cash flows  ii any internal delays in processing accounts received by the cedant are not materially different from that experienced historically  and hence the implicit reserving allowance made in loss reserves through our methods continues to be appropriate  iii case reserve reporting practices  particularly the methodologies used to establish and report case reserves  are unchanged from historical practices  iv the company s internal claim practices  particularly the level and extent of use of acrs are unchanged  v historical levels of claim inflation can be projected into the future and will have no material effect on either the acceleration or deceleration of claim reporting and payment patterns  vi the selection of reserving cells results in homogeneous and credible future expectations for all business in the cell and any changes in underlying treaty terms are either reflected in cell selection or explicitly allowed in the selection of trends  vii in cases where benchmarks are used  they are derived from the experience of similar business  and viii the company can form a credible initial expectation of the ultimate loss ratio of recent underwriting years through a review of pricing information supplemented by qualitative information on market events 
in general  the estimates of unpaid losses and loss expense reserves loss reserves recorded for short tailed business are subject to less volatility than those for long tailed lines 
carried loss reserves for the us property and casualty sub segment are considered to be predominantly long tailed due to the significant volume of us casualty business written in this sub segment 
the casualty line comprised of the net premiums written for this sub segment  or of the company s total net premiums written in the remaining business within this sub segment  motor and property  is considered to be short tailed 
within the global non us property and casualty sub segment  the company considers both its casualty business as well as its non proportional motor business to be long tailed 
these two lines represented of the net premiums written in the global non us property and casualty sub segment  or of the company s total net premiums written in management considers the short tailed lines within the global non us property and casualty sub segment to be property and proportional motor 
the worldwide specialty sub segment is primarily comprised of lines of business that are thought to be either short or medium tailed 
the short tailed lines consist of agriculture  catastrophe  energy  credit surety and specialty property and account for of the net premiums written in this sub segment  or of the company s total net premiums written in aviation space  engineering and marine are considered by the company to have a medium tail and represent of this sub segment s net 
table of contents premiums written  or of the company s total net premiums written in specialty casualty business is considered to be long tailed and represents of net premiums written in this sub segment  or of the company s total net premiums written in within the company s us property and casualty sub segment  losses reported during and were higher than the loss reserves that the company established at the end of and  respectively 
this primarily affected the motor line during and the casualty line during since  the company has observed an industry wide deterioration of loss development for prior accident years in the motor line  particularly on the non proportional treaties 
for the motor and casualty lines of business  the company received loss information from cedants for prior accident years that included no significant losses but a series of attritional losses 
attritional losses or reductions are losses or reductions than may not be significant on an individual basis  but are monitored on an aggregated basis by the company to identify trends that may be meaningful from a reserving standpoint 
upon consideration of this new information received during and  the company revised the loss development assumptions it uses in performing its actuarial analysis and increased its loss reserves for prior accident years by million and million  respectively  during and in particular  the company revised the historical loss patterns and expected loss ratios that it uses in its actuarial analysis of loss reserves for the affected losses 
for the global non us property and casualty sub segment  losses reported during were higher than the loss reserves established by the company at the end of during  the company observed a deterioration in the loss experience in the motor and casualty lines in this sub segment 
losses reported by cedants during regarding prior accident years were higher than expected  which led the company to increase its expected ultimate loss ratio  which in turn had the effect of increasing the company s loss reserves by million for this sub segment 
during  the company reported million of favorable reserve development 
losses reported by cedants during regarding prior accident years included no significant loss reductions but a series of loss reductions of attritional losses 
for the worldwide specialty sub segment  losses reported by cedants during and for prior accident years were lower than the company expected 
this led the company to decrease its expected ultimate loss ratio for prior year losses in and  which resulted in a decrease in the company s loss reserves of million and million during and  respectively 
losses reported during were lower than expected in most lines  while losses reported during were lower than expected primarily in the aviation  credit surety and energy lines  partially offset by higher than expected development in marine and agriculture

table of contents case reserves are reported to the company by its cedants  while acr and ibnr are estimated by the company 
the following table shows the gross reserves reported by cedants case reserves and those estimated by the company acr and ibnr for each non life sub segment and the total net loss reserves recorded in millions of us dollars case reserves acr ibnr total gross loss reserves recorded retrocession total net loss reserves recorded us property and casualty global non us property and casualty worldwide specialty total non life the company estimates its net loss reserves using single point estimates for each sub segment 
these loss reserves represent the company s best estimate of future losses and loss expense amounts 
ranges around these point estimates are developed using stochastic simulations and techniques and provide an indication as to the degree of variability of the loss reserves 
the company interprets the ranges produced by these techniques as confidence intervals around the best estimates for each sub segment 
however  due to the inherent volatility in the business written by the company  there can be no guarantee that the final settlement of the loss reserves will fall within these ranges 
the point estimates recorded by the company and the range of estimates around these point estimates at december   were as follows in millions of us dollars recorded point estimate high low net non life loss reserves us property and casualty global non us property and casualty worldwide specialty it is not appropriate to add together the ranges of each segment in an effort to determine a high and low range around the company s total non life carried loss reserves 
estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events 
the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates 
in the event that the business environment and social trends diverge from historical trends  the company may have to adjust its loss reserves to amounts falling significantly outside its current estimate range 
management believes that the recorded loss reserves represent the best estimate of future liabilities based on information available as of december  the estimates are continually reviewed and the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts provided  for which any adjustments will be reflected in the periods in which the need for an adjustment is determined 
liabilities for policy benefits for ordinary life and accident and health policies have been established based upon information reported by cedants supplemented by the company s best actuarial estimates of mortality  morbidity  persistency and future investment income  with appropriate provision for adverse deviation 
future policy benefit reserves for annuity and universal life products are carried at their accumulated values 
reserves for policy claims and benefits include both mortality and morbidity claims in the process of settlement and claims that are assumed to have been incurred but not yet reported 
interest rate assumptions used to estimate liabilities for policy benefits for life and annuity contracts ranged from to 
actual experience in a particular period may vary from assumed experience and  consequently  may affect the company s results in future periods 
included in the business that is considered to have a long reporting tail is the company s exposure to asbestos and environmental claims 
the company s reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses as of december  
table of contents included million that represents an estimate of its net ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims 
the majority of this loss and loss expense reserve relates to us casualty exposures arising from business written by partnerre sa and partnerre us see note to consolidated financial statements 
ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques and there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses for these claims 
in view of the changes in the legal and tort environment that affect the development of such claims  the uncertainties inherent in valuing asbestos and environmental claims are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
there can be no assurance that the loss reserves established by the company will not be adversely affected by the development of other latent exposures  and further  there can be no assurance that the loss reserves established by the company will be adequate 
the company does  however  actively evaluate potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and establishes additional loss reserves as appropriate 
the company believes that it has made a reasonable provision for these exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would materially affect its loss and loss expense estimates 
premiums management must also make judgments about the ultimate premiums written and earned by the company 
reported premiums written and earned are based upon reports received from cedants  supplemented by the company s own estimates of premiums written for which ceding company reports have not been received 
the company derives its own estimates based on discussions and correspondence with its brokers and cedants during the negotiation of the treaty and over the treaty risk period 
the determination of estimates requires a review of the company s experience with cedants  familiarity with each geographic market  a thorough understanding of the individual characteristics of each line of business and the ability to project the impact of current economic indicators on the volume of business written and ceded by the company s cedants 
premium estimates are updated when new information is received 
differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined 
approximately of the company s reported net premiums written for are based upon such estimates 
deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of brokerage  commissions  and excise taxes  which vary directly with  and are primarily related to  the acquisition and renewal of reinsurance treaties  are capitalized and charged to expense as the related premium revenue is recognized 
the company is required under us gaap to evaluate the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs and immediately expense amounts estimated to be unrecoverable 
a number of estimates  such as anticipated losses and loss expenses  other costs and investment income and the related premiums  need to be projected and considered by management in determining the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs 
other than temporary impairment of investments the company regularly evaluates the fair value of its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis original cost basis for equities is other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the amortized cost of the individual security is written down to fair value as its new cost basis  and the amount of the write down is included as a realized investment loss in the consolidated statements of operations  which reduces net income in the period in which the determination of other than temporary impairment is made 
in contrast  temporary losses are recorded as unrealized investment losses  which do not impact net income  but reduce other comprehensive income  except for those related to trading securities  which are recorded immediately as losses in net income 
to determine whether securities with unrealized investment losses are impaired  the company must  for each specific issuer or security  evaluate whether events have occurred that are likely to prevent the company from recovering its initial investment in the security in the near term 
in the company s determination of other than temporary impairment  the company reviews and evaluates the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s 
table of contents credit and financial strength ratings  general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  general economic and financial market conditions  the length of time for which the fair value of an issuer s securities remain below cost and other factors that may raise doubt about the issuer s ability to continue as a going concern 
as of december   the company held investment positions that carried unrealized losses of million  including million on securities that carried unrealized losses for more that continuous months 
in management s judgment  the company had no significant unrealized losses for which an other than temporary impairment charge has not been taken  caused by other factors and circumstances  including an issuer s specific corporate risk or due to industry or geographic risk 
income taxes the company has a net deferred tax asset of million arising primarily from net operating loss carry forwards that it can use to offset future taxable income 
realization of the deferred tax asset depends on generating sufficient taxable income generally within a limited number of future periods 
in establishing the appropriate value of this asset  management has developed income projections based on what it perceives are the trends in reinsurance pricing  loss development and interest rates to evaluate the company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards in each taxable jurisdiction prior to the loss carry forward expiration dates 
in the event that the company is unable to realize a deferred tax asset  for example with the expiration of an unutilized net operating loss carry forward  net income would be adversely affected to the extent a valuation allowance has not been established 
as of december   the company has a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset of million based upon management s assessment that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in some of the applicable jurisdictions 
goodwill on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that the company make an annual assessment as to whether the value of the company s goodwill asset is impaired 
based upon the company s assessment at the reporting unit level  there was no impairment of its goodwill asset of million as of december  in making an assessment of the value of its goodwill  the company uses both market based and non market based valuations 
assumptions underlying these valuations include an analysis of the company s stock price relative to both its book value and its net income in addition to forecasts of future cash flow and future profits 
significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in an impairment of the company s goodwill asset 
in addition  if the current economic environment and or the company s financial performance were to deteriorate significantly  this could lead to an impairment of goodwill  the write off of which would be recorded in net income in the period such deterioration occurred 
valuation of certain derivative financial instruments as a part of its art alternative risk transfer operations  the company utilizes non traded derivatives 
the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and are included in the determination of net income in the period in which they are recorded 
the company uses internal valuation models to estimate the fair value of these derivatives and develops assumptions that require significant judgment  such as the timing of future cash flows of reference securities  credit spreads and general levels of interest rates 
for weather derivatives  the company develops assumptions for weather measurements as of the valuation date of the derivative and for probable future weather observations based on statistical analysis of historical data 
significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in a significantly different valuation of the derivative and significant adjustments to net income in the period in which the company makes the adjustment 

table of contents results of operations overview the company measures its performance in several ways 
among the performance measures accepted under us gaap are diluted net income per share and return on beginning common shareholders equity roe  two measures that focus on the return provided to the company s common shareholders 
diluted net income per share is obtained by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common and common share equivalents outstanding 
net income available to common shareholders is defined as net income less preferred share dividends 
net income available to common shareholders is also used in the calculation of the company s roe  which is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the net book value of the common shareholders equity at the beginning of the year 
the net book value of the common shareholders equity is obtained by subtracting the aggregate liquidation value of the preferred shares from total shareholders equity 
net income  preferred dividends  net income available to common shareholders  diluted net income per share and roe for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions of us dollars  except per share data and roe for the year ended december  change over for the year ended december  change over for the year ended december  net income less preferred dividends net income available to common shareholders diluted net income per share return on beginning common shareholders equity roe over net income  net income available to common shareholders and diluted net income per share increased in compared to as a result of higher net investment income and net realized investment gains  and lower preferred dividends in the significant positive cash flows from operations generated by the company during and is the main contributor to the increase in net investment income 
the increase in net realized investment gains does not change the company s comprehensive income as it merely transfers the gain from other comprehensive income to net income and retained earnings 
preferred dividends for included a non recurring charge of million related to the redemption of the company s series a preferred shares and the overlap of preferred dividends on series a and c preferred shares prior to the redemption of the series a preferred shares in the second quarter of the company s roe declined during compared to despite the increase in the company s net income in compared to this results because roe is a ratio of the current year net income available to common shareholders to beginning january book value of the common shareholders equity 
net income available to common shareholders grew by in  while the beginning book value of the common shareholders equity was higher than  and when growth in the current year net income available to common shareholders is slower than growth in the prior year book value of the common shareholders equity  roe decreases compared to the prior year 
over net income  preferred dividends  net income available to common shareholders  diluted net income per share and roe increased for compared to  principally as a result of improved underwriting results defined as net premiums earned plus other income less losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and other operating 
table of contents expenses  and increased net realized investment gains 
contributing to the improvement in underwriting results were the improved market conditions as well as the lack of catastrophic losses in while was free of large catastrophic losses and other large losses  included a loss on the european floods of million 
preferred dividends for included a non recurring charge of million related to the redemption of the company s series a preferred shares and the overlap of preferred dividends as discussed above 
the increase in the company s roe during compared to is due to the faster growth in net income available to common shareholders compared to the growth in book value of the common shareholders equity 
when growth in the current year net income available to common shareholders is faster than growth in the prior year book value of the common shareholders equity  roe increases compared to the prior year 
review of net income management analyzes the company s net income in three parts underwriting result  investment income and other components of net income 
investment income includes interest and dividends  net of investment expenses  generated by the company s investment portfolio  as well as interest income generated on funds held and certain art transactions 
other components of net income include net realized investment gains and losses  interest expense  net foreign exchange gains and losses  income tax expense or benefit and distributions related to trust preferred and mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 
the components of net income for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions of us dollars for the year ended december  change over for the year ended december  change over for the year ended december  underwriting result non life art nm life corporate expenses net investment income net realized investment gains losses nm interest expense net foreign exchange gains losses nm income tax expense distributions related to trust preferred and mandatorily redeemable preferred securities nm net income nm not meaningful underwriting result is a key measurement that the company uses to manage and evaluate its segments and sub segments  as it is a primary measure of underlying profitability for our core reinsurance operations  separate from our investment results 
the company believes that in order to enhance the understanding of its profitability  it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate 
underwriting result should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business  which is also impacted by investment results and other items 

table of contents over underwriting result for the non life segment decreased  from million in to million in the decrease in the non life underwriting result was principally attributable to an increase of million in other operating expenses to support the company s growth and a modestly higher technical ratio that translated into a decrease of million in the underwriting result of this segment 
included in the underwriting result for the non life segment were million of net losses related to the atlantic hurricanes  partially offset by the strong market conditions as well as favorable development on prior accident year losses of million  as the company reduced its estimate of losses for certain lines as the at risk period for older years expired and updated information was received from cedants 
the components of the favorable loss development on prior accident year losses are described in more detail in the discussion of individual sub segments in the next section 
underwriting result for the life segment decreased  from a loss of million in to a loss of million in while the life segment experienced growth during  the underwriting loss for was stable as it included a million charge recognized in the first quarter of to reduce deferred acquisition costs on annuity treaties retained in the sale of partnerre life insurance company of the us  as well as a million loss in the fourth quarter of related to the indian ocean tsunami 
the increase in corporate expenses results from management s effort to enhance the company s infrastructure to support the growth of the company s business and is primarily attributable to an increase in staff in corporate departments  such as the actuarial  internal audit and tax departments  as well as higher compliance expenses 
the company reported net investment income of million in compared to million in the increase in investment income is primarily attributable to investment of the company s significant cash flows from operations  which amounted to  million in and  million in  as well as the effect of the decline of the us dollar against the euro and other currencies  which contributed approximately to the growth in net realized investment gains increased from million in to million in realized investment gains and losses are generally a function of multiple factors with the most significant being the prevailing interest rates and the timing of disposition of available for sale fixed maturities and equity securities  and charges for the recognition of other than temporary impairments in the company s investment portfolio 
as the company repositions its investment portfolio to take advantage of market conditions  it generates sales of securities that result in the realization of the unrealized market value appreciation or depreciation on the securities 
the realization of the unrealized market value appreciation or depreciation does not change the company s comprehensive income and shareholders equity  as it merely transfers the gain or loss from the accumulated other comprehensive income section of the consolidated balance sheet to net income on the consolidated statement of operations and retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet 
interest expense increased in compared to as a result of the change in classification of the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in the third quarter of  following the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and requires that certain financial instruments  such as the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred securities  be classified prospectively as a liability on the balance sheet and the related distributions be classified as interest expense on the income statement 
the company has classified distributions related to its mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as interest expense since july   which distorts the comparison of interest expense and distributions related to mandatorily redeemable preferred securities between and  but does not affect its net income or equity for these years 
the company hedges a significant portion of its currency risk exposure as discussed in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this report 
the increase in net foreign exchange gains in compared to results primarily from a lower revaluation loss related to the company s net liabilities denominated in certain currencies that are not hedged and that have appreciated against the us dollar 

table of contents the income tax expense increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of a change in the geography or tax jurisdiction of pre tax income 
the company s income tax expense or benefit is dependent on the distribution of the company s pre tax results in each tax jurisdiction 
the tax expense is net of a tax recovery in the amount of million related to the settlement of a tax arbitration in france and a favorable adjustment of million  net of valuation allowance  resulting from adjustments to prior year income tax returns in switzerland 
over underwriting result for the non life segment increased significantly from million in to million in contributing to the improvement of underwriting results were the lack of catastrophic losses in as well as improved market conditions 
while the period was free of large catastrophic losses and other large losses  the period included a loss on the european floods of million 
the improvement in pricing  terms and conditions observed during the and renewals had positive effects on both and periods  but more predominantly on the period since premiums written during the latter half of were earned during the period included a net adverse development of million for the and prior accident years in its non life segment 
the components making up the net adverse development for are described in more detail in the discussion of the individual sub segments in the next section 
the increase in corporate expenses results from management s effort to enhance the company s infrastructure to support the growth of the company s business and is primarily attributable to an increase in staff in corporate departments  such as the actuarial  internal audit and tax departments 
in addition to higher underwriting result  the company reported net realized investment gains on investments of million in compared to losses of million in realized investment gains and losses are generally a function of multiple factors including the prevailing interest rates  with the most significant being the timing of disposition of available for sale fixed maturities and equity securities and charges for the recognition of other than temporary impairments in the company s investment portfolio 
as the company positions its investment portfolio to take advantage of market conditions  it generates sales of securities  which result in the realization of the unrealized market value appreciation or depreciation on the securities 
the realization of the unrealized market value appreciation or depreciation does not change the company s comprehensive income and shareholders equity as it merely transfers the gain or loss from the accumulated other comprehensive income section of the consolidated balance sheet to net income on the consolidated statement of operations and retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company reported net investment income of million in compared to million in the increase in investment income is primarily attributable to investment of the company s significant cash flows from operations  which amounted to  million in  as well as the effect of the decline of the us dollar against the euro and other currencies 
the increase in interest expense relates to the adoption of sfas on july   as discussed above 
the company reported net foreign exchange gains of million in compared to a loss of million in the company hedges a significant portion of its currency risk exposure as discussed in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this report 
although the company uses derivatives to hedge the opening consolidated balance sheet at the beginning of each quarter  the hedges do not cover transactions recorded in that given quarter in the consolidated statement of operations 
these transactions are subsequently hedged as part of the following quarter opening consolidated balance sheet 
the main factor contributing to the improvement in foreign exchange gains during is the difference in foreign exchange rates used to revalue the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated balance sheets 
income statement transactions denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the weighted average exchange rates for the year in the consolidated statement of operations  while the equivalent movements on the balance sheet are 
table of contents revalued at the year end rates 
this gives rise to a net foreign exchange gain or loss  depending on whether individual currencies are stronger on average during the year or at the end of the year 
the income tax expense was comparable in and the company s income tax expense or benefit is dependent on the distribution of the company s pre tax result in each tax jurisdiction 
the next section provides a detailed discussion and analysis of the company s underwriting result by segment and sub segment  investment income and net realized investment gains or losses for the years ended december   and results by segment the company monitors the performance of its underwriting operations in three segments  non life  art and life 
the non life segment is further divided into three sub segments  us property and casualty  global us property and casualty and worldwide specialty 
segments and sub segments represent markets that are reasonably homogeneous in terms of geography  client types  buying patterns  underlying risk patterns and approach to risk management 
see the description of the company s segments and sub segments as well as a discussion of how the company s measures its segment results in note to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii below 
segment results are shown net of intercompany transactions 
the company has treated its art operations as a reportable segment beginning in the first quarter of segment information for prior periods has been reclassified to conform to this new presentation 
business reported in the global non us property and casualty and worldwide specialty sub segments and the life segment is to a significant extent denominated in foreign currencies and is reported in us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for each year 
the us dollar has declined in value during each of the three years presented and this should be considered when making year to year comparisons 

table of contents non life segment us property and casualty the technical result  defined as net premiums earned less losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs  and the technical ratio  defined as the sum of the loss and loss expenses and acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned  have been stable for the last three years for this sub segment 
the company believes the business currently being written in this sub segment is profitable  notwithstanding the negative technical result  once investment income is added to the technical result 
the us specialty casualty line is included in this sub segment and represents approximately of net premiums written for in this sub segment 
this line typically tends to have a higher loss ratio and lower technical result  due to the long tailed nature of the risks involved 
specialty casualty treaties also typically provide for investment income on premiums invested over a longer period as losses are typically paid later than for other lines 
investment income  however  is not considered in technical result 
the following table provides the components of the technical result and the corresponding ratios for this sub segment in millions of us dollars change over change over gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned losses and loss expenses acquisition costs technical result loss ratio acquisition ratio technical ratio technical result is defined as net premiums earned less losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs 
loss ratio is obtained by dividing losses and loss expenses by net premiums earned 
acquisition ratio is obtained by dividing acquisition costs by net premiums earned 
technical ratio is defined as the sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition ratio 
premiums the us property and casualty sub segment represented of total net premiums written in the growth in gross and net premiums written over resulted from the casualty line  where terms and conditions remained strong 
premiums in property and motor decreased principally due to the softening of terms and conditions and increased risk retention by cedants 
growth in this sub segment was impacted by the company s selectivity in pursuing business that met its profitability objectives 
based on the january  pricing indications and renewal information received from cedants and brokers  gross and net premiums written are expected to decline modestly in for this sub segment 
as net premiums written have grown in and are earned over the risk period  which is generally one to two years  net premiums earned are expected to increase modestly in despite the expected modest reduction in net premiums written 
gross and net premiums written grew in compared to as the company took advantage of a combination of rate increases and improved terms and conditions observed in the reinsurance markets throughout and while the company experienced growth in every line in this sub segment  growth was most pronounced in the specialty casualty line  as the company perceived this line to provide very good terms and conditions

the net adverse loss development of million included adverse loss development for prior accident years in the motor and casualty lines of million  partially offset by favorable loss development in the shorter tailed property line of million 
the adverse loss development for motor reflects primarily actual loss experience during being worse than expected 
the adverse loss development in the casualty line was primarily due to a revaluation of the loss development assumptions used by the company to estimate future liabilities due to what it believes are adverse industry wide trends in that line of business 
loss information provided by cedants in for all lines in this sub segment for prior years included no individually significant losses or reductions of losses but a series of attritional losses or reductions 
based on the company s assessment of this loss information  the company has increased its expected ultimate loss ratios for the motor and casualty lines decreased for the property line  which had the net effect of increasing the level of loss reserves for this sub segment 
included in the favorable development in the property line was a million reduction in the company s loss estimate related to the september tragedy  as the company received information from cedants indicating that certain outstanding loss reserves were no longer necessary

the increase in losses and loss expenses and loss ratio from to is explained by growth in the book of business and the increasing proportion of specialty casualty business written in this sub segment  as the sum of the atlantic hurricane losses and prior year development for is comparable to the adverse prior year development recorded in while and were free of large loss events  the increase in losses and loss expenses and loss ratio from to is explained by the growth in the book of business and the increased proportion of specialty casualty business in this sub segment 
acquisition costs the decrease in acquisition costs and acquisition ratio from to results from reductions in acquisition costs on treaties with experience credits in the form of sliding scale and profit commission adjustments 
the increase in acquisition costs from to resulted from growth in the book of business as evidenced by the increase in net premiums earned 
the acquisition ratio was comparable for and global non us property and casualty the technical result for the global non us property and casualty sub segment has fluctuated in the last three years  reflecting varying levels of large loss events and development on prior years reserves 
the company believes the business currently being written in this sub segment is profitable notwithstanding the negative technical result  once investment income is added to the technical result 
the global non us property and 
table of contents casualty sub segment is composed of long tail business  in the form of casualty and non proportional motor business  that represents approximately of net premiums written for in this sub segment  and short tail business  in the form of property and proportional motor business 
the technical result for long tailed and short tailed business reflected different trends  and accordingly results for this sub segment are mixed

the remainder of the growth in this sub segment was attributable to the casualty line and was partially offset by decreases in the motor and property lines 
notwithstanding the increased competition prevailing in this sub segment  and higher risk retention from cedants  the terms and conditions remained strong in and the company was able to pursue business that met its profitability objectives 
based on the january  pricing indications and renewal information received from cedants and brokers  and assuming constant foreign exchange rates  gross and net premiums written are expected to decline modestly in for this sub segment 
as net premiums written have grown in and are earned over the risk period  which is generally one to two years  net premiums earned are expected to increase modestly in despite the expected modest reduction in net premiums written 
throughout and the company took advantage of a combination of rate increases and improved terms and conditions in the property and casualty markets in most countries 
the turmoil in financial markets and the downgrading of major reinsurers during provided opportunities for the company 
as a result  the company was able to increase its shares on existing treaties and grew its book of business during the renewals 
foreign exchange contributed approximately points to the growth in net premiums written in this sub segment in  as premiums denominated in currencies that have appreciated against the us dollar were converted into us dollars at higher exchange rates

table of contents nature of the risks involved 
the adverse loss development of million included adverse loss development for prior accident years in the motor and casualty lines of million  partially offset by favorable loss development in the shorter tailed property line of million 
the adverse loss development in the motor and casualty lines is primarily due to a revaluation of the loss development assumptions  particularly in the non proportional lines  used by the company to estimate future liabilities due to what it believes are adverse industry wide trends in these lines of business 
loss information provided by cedants in for all lines in this sub segment for prior years included no individually significant losses or reductions but a series of attritional losses or reductions

the net favorable loss development of million included adverse loss development for prior accident years of million on the motor line offset by million of favorable development on the property and casualty lines 
the losses and loss expenses and loss ratio reported in reflected losses related to the european floods in the amount of million 
the increase in losses and loss expenses and loss ratio from to is explained by adverse prior year development for  growth in the book of business  losses related to the atlantic hurricanes and the increasing proportion of casualty business written in this sub segment 
the increase in losses from to is explained by the growth in the book of business and the increased proportion of specialty casualty business in this sub segment 
the year was free of large or catastrophic losses  and this is the main factor contributing to the decrease in the loss ratio from to acquisition costs the increase in acquisition costs in and is the result of the increase in the volume of premiums earned for each year 
the acquisition ratio is comparable for all three years 
worldwide specialty the worldwide specialty sub segment continues to be the most profitable sub segment within the company  however  it is important to note that this sub segment is exposed to significant catastrophe and other large losses  and thus  profitability in any one year is not necessarily predictive of future profitability 
the following table provides the components of the technical result and their corresponding ratios for this sub segment in millions of us dollars change over change over gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned losses and loss expenses acquisition costs technical result loss ratio acquisition ratio technical ratio 
table of contents premiums the worldwide specialty sub segment represented of total net premiums written in gross and net premiums written and earned were relatively flat in compared to the weakening of the us dollar in compared to contributed approximately points of growth in net premiums written in this sub segment 
the company has seen no real change in market trends since the second half of  where the pricing for the most profitable lines of business had started to decline and the other lines exhibited a slow but orderly reduction in the rate of price increases as a result of increasing competition 
however  following the exceptional level of natural catastrophes in the third quarter of  the company observed that pricing deterioration has slowed down in the markets and lines directly affected by these loss events 
in  the company has remained selective in pursuing business that met its profitability objectives and has declined treaties where terms and conditions did not meet the company s standards 
based on the january  pricing indications and renewal information received from cedants and brokers  and assuming constant foreign exchange rates  gross and net premiums written and earned are expected to decline modestly in for this sub segment 
the growth observed in gross and net premiums written in compared to is the result of a combination of increased participations  pricing and exposures as well as new business opportunities across most specialty lines 
in  the growth was more pronounced in the credit surety  energy and non us specialty casualty part of special risk lines while in  the aviation  engineering energy and non us specialty casualty lines saw the largest growth 
foreign exchange contributed approximately points to the growth in net premiums written in this sub segment in  as premiums denominated in currencies that appreciated against the us dollar were converted into us dollars at higher exchange rates 
during and  the global reinsurance industry focused on rates  terms and conditions with a lower emphasis on market share in the specialty lines area 
in addition  several reinsurers withdrew from these markets  most notably in the aviation space line 
the company took advantage of the considerable rate increases and improved terms and conditions it saw in the lines of business that comprise this sub segment and allocated capital to those lines where pricing and terms were most attractive 
losses and loss expenses the losses and loss expense and loss ratio reported in reflect a losses related to the atlantic hurricanes in the amount of million or points on the loss ratio of this sub segment  and b net favorable loss development on prior accident years in the amount of million 
the net favorable loss development of million included favorable loss development of million for prior accident years in all lines  except for the specialty casualty line that was affected by adverse loss development of million 
the net favorable loss development is primarily due to a revaluation of the loss development assumptions used by the company to estimate future liabilities due to what it believes are favorable experience trends in these lines of business as losses reported by cedants during for prior accident years  and for treaties where the risk period expired  were lower higher for specialty casualty than the company expected 
included in the net favorable development was a million reduction of the company s loss estimate related to the september tragedy  as the company received information from cedants indicating that certain outstanding loss reserves were no longer necessary 
the losses and loss expenses and loss ratio reported in reflected a no significant or catastrophic loss and an exceptionally low amount of mid size losses  b favorable loss development on prior accident years in the amount of million  and c growth in the book of business and exposure for this sub segment as evidenced by the increase in net premiums earned 
the net favorable loss development of million included favorable loss development for prior accident years of million on the aviation  credit surety  engineering energy  catastrophe and other lines  which was partially offset by adverse loss development of million on the agriculture  marine and specialty casualty lines 
losses reported by cedants during for the prior accident years were lower than the company expected  which led the company to decrease its expected ultimate loss ratio for this sub segment for prior accident years 
the main factors influencing the company s lower than expected reported losses were a series of reductions in attritional losses and a lower number of newly reported losses by cedants 
this net positive loss development included a decrease in loss reserves of million related to the september tragedy 

table of contents the losses and loss expenses and loss ratio reported in reflect losses related to the european floods in the amount of million or points on the loss ratio of this sub segment 
the decrease in losses and loss expenses and loss ratio from to in this sub segment is explained by favorable prior year development in  which was partially offset by losses related to the atlantic hurricanes 
the increase in losses and loss expenses from to was explained by the growth in the book of business in this sub segment 
the year was free of large or catastrophic losses and this is the main factor contributing to the decrease in the loss ratio from to acquisition costs the increase in acquisition costs and acquisition ratio in compared to results primarily from a shift from treaties previously written on a net basis  where premiums are ceded to the company net of acquisition costs  to treaties written on a gross basis  where acquisition costs are reported separately from premiums 
this change in the form of the treaty does not affect the technical result under the treaty but distorts the period over period comparison for acquisition costs 
other factors contributing to the increase included intensifying competition in this sub segment  which tends to increase the acquisition ratio  and a shift between lines of business where certain lines carry higher acquisition ratios 
the increase in acquisition costs in compared to was the result of the increase in the volume of premiums earned in the acquisition ratio was comparable for and art alternative risk transfer segment the art segment  the company s newest segment  was reported for the first time as a separate segment in the following table provides the components of the underwriting result for this segment for the years ended december   and in millions of us dollars gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned losses and loss expenses acquisition costs technical result other income other operating expenses underwriting result as reinsurance accounting does not apply for much of the business in this segment  premiums alone are not a representative measure of activity in art 
this segment is very transaction driven  and revenues and profit trends will be uneven  especially given the still small size of this segment 
the company expects the art segment and results to grow during as this segment continues to expand 
the art segment had good growth in business during compared to despite low interest rates  which reduced the attractiveness of structured risks business for clients  and low credit spreads  which reduced the opportunities in the structured finance business 
the art segment had positive results due to the commutation of two large treaties  which accelerated the recognition of the margin on the treaties 
this was partially offset by a loss in the third quarter of as one treaty incurred a loss related to the atlantic hurricanes 
results for the structured finance business included gains arising due to the increase in the fair value of derivative positions related to certain securities whose market value had increased due to narrower spreads on underlying securities  while results in the weather line included losses resulting from higher than normal temperatures in japan 
the 
table of contents company s share of the results of channel re was included in its art results for amounting to million 
this amount represents results for the period from february  the date of the company s acquisition of an ownership interest  to september   as the company records income on its investment in channel re on a one quarter lag 
channel re is a non publicly traded financial guarantee reinsurer based in bermuda 
the growth in business for this segment during compared to resulted from the expansion of the structured finance and weather business 
the increase in other operating expenses resulted from the addition of underwriters and staff in the art team to support the growth of the art business 
life segment the following table summarizes the underwriting result for this segment in millions of us dollars change over change over gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned life policy benefits acquisition costs technical result other operating expenses net investment income allocated underwriting result nm nm nm not meaningful allocated underwriting result is defined as net premiums earned and allocated net investment income less life policy benefits  acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
premiums the life segment represented of total net premiums written in the increases in gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned during and resulted primarily from two factors 
first  the company took advantage of the disruption observed in the european life insurance and reinsurance market as the poor performance of equity markets in the last three years reduced the capital available in the industry 
secondly  the us dollar weakened during and and premiums denominated in currencies that have appreciated against the us dollar were converted into us dollars at higher exchange rates 
foreign exchange accounted for points of growth in net premiums written during based on the january  pricing indications and renewal information received from cedants and brokers  and assuming constant foreign exchange rates  gross and net premiums written and earned are expected to increase modestly in for this segment 
life policy benefits and acquisition costs the increase in life policy benefits and acquisition costs in compared to results primarily from the growth in the company s book of business and exposure  as evidenced by the increase in net premiums earned for this segment 
this was partially offset by reclassifications made by a cedant in for one large treaty where the cedant reported a reduction in life policy benefits and an increase in acquisition costs 
these reclassifications affect the comparison of life policy benefits and acquisition costs between and the increase in acquisition costs in compared to is attributable to three factors including this reclassification  a change in the mix of business where certain lines typically carry higher acquisition costs and a 
table of contents million charge recognized in the first quarter of to reduce deferred acquisition costs on annuity treaties retained in the sale of partnerre life insurance company of the us the prolonged period of low interest rates has had a negative effect on these treaties resulting in a charge reflecting the actual experience to date as well as a revised projection of future results given updated assumptions 
the increase in life policy benefits for the and periods resulted primarily from the growth in exposure due to a growing book of business 
the period included a million charge related to the amortization of acquisition costs on business that was retained in the sale of the us life reinsurance business 
in  the company reduced its estimate of the anticipated gross profit for this treaty and accordingly accelerated the amortization of the related deferred acquisition costs 
this explained the lack of growth in acquisition costs from to compared the growth in net premiums earned for the same periods 
net investment income the decrease in net investment income for this segment for compared to is attributable to a life annuity treaty for which the cedant has reported lower net investment income during the increase in net investment income for this segment for compared to was primarily attributable to the growth in the book of business as well as a life annuity treaty for which the cedant has reported higher net investment income during premium distribution by line of business the distribution of net premiums written by line of business for the years ended december   and  was as follows in millions of us dollars change over change over non life property and casualty property casualty motor worldwide specialty agriculture aviation space catastrophe credit surety engineering energy marine special risk other art life total over a number of factors affected the amount and distribution of net premiums written during as follows i as prices were declining in short tail lines  such as property  agriculture  aviation space  catastrophe  energy  the company determined to non renew certain treaties that did not meet its profitability standard  ii a number of treaties were non renewed as a result of the cedant retaining the risk as opposed to ceding it to a reinsurer  iii as 
table of contents prices and terms and conditions were still strong in the casualty  motor  credit surety  special risk and life  the company took advantage of market conditions  and iv the us dollar weakened during and premiums denominated in foreign currencies that had appreciated against the us dollar were converted in us dollars at higher foreign exchange rates 
the impact of foreign exchange amounted to points of growth on total net premiums written 
over except for the agriculture line  the dollar value of gross premiums written increased for all lines in and  which reflected the company s growth in a favorable underwriting environment as well as the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on premiums 
the property  casualty  credit surety  engineering energy and life lines of business reflected a faster growth as a result of the company s taking advantage of better pricing  terms and conditions in these lines during the renewals 
the slower growth in the catastrophe line of business in resulted from the limits set by management on the company s overall catastrophe exposure 
the relatively slower growth in the motor and aviation space lines of business in was attributable to flat or softening terms and conditions or profitability in these lines 
the flattening of premiums in the agriculture line of business in reflected the non renewal of treaties whose pricing  terms and conditions did not meet the company s profitability objectives and the selective acceptance of new treaties  which the company believed would meet its objectives 
based on january  pricing indications and renewal information from cedants and brokers  and assuming constant foreign exchange rates  the company expects total net premiums written to be equal to or down approximately compared to the company found the global markets to be somewhat more competitive than expected  while the us markets remained at reasonable profitability levels in the majority of lines 
based on this market information  the company expects net premiums written for the non life segment  more particularly in the short and medium tailed lines where the competition is the most intense  will decrease in and net premiums written for the life and art segments will increase modestly 
premium distribution by treaty type the company typically writes business on either a proportional or non proportional basis 
on proportional business  the company shares proportionally in both the premiums and losses of the cedant 
in non proportional business  the company is typically exposed to loss events in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or loss ratio 
in both proportional and non proportional business  the company typically reinsures a large group of primary insurance contracts written by the ceding company 
in addition  the company writes a small percentage of its business on a facultative basis 
facultative arrangements are generally specific to an individual risk and can be written on either a proportional or non proportional basis 
generally  the company has more influence over pricing  as well as terms and conditions  in non proportional and facultative arrangements 

table of contents the distribution of gross premiums written by type of treaty for the years ended december   and  was as follows in millions of us dollars change over change over non life segment proportional non proportional facultative life segment proportional non proportional art segment proportional nm non proportional total nm not meaningful a number of factors affected the amount and distribution of net premiums written during as follows i as prices were declining in a number of short tail lines  the company determined to non renew certain treaties  ii a number of treaties were non renewed as a result of the cedant retaining the risk as opposed to ceding it to a reinsurer  and iii the us dollar was weaker in the period than it was in the period 
as a result  changes in foreign exchange contributed approximately points to the growth in gross premiums written in the period and affect the year to year comparison for all lines and treaty types 
based on january  pricing indications and renewal information from cedants and brokers  and assuming constant foreign exchange rates  the company expects no significant changes in the distribution of gross premiums written by treaty type in premium distribution by geographic region the geographic distribution of gross premiums written for the years ended december   and  was as follows in millions of us dollars change over change over north america europe asia  australia  new zealand latin america and the caribbean africa total growth in the european market was influenced by the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and other currencies in compared to and in compared to and this contributed to the increase in the european market for the and periods and distorts the year to year comparisons

the distribution of gross premiums written by production source for the years ended december   and  was as follows broker direct the company s us property and casualty sub segment generates business predominantly through brokers  and other non life sub segments generate business predominantly through direct relationships with cedants 
the distribution of gross premiums by production source was comparable for all periods presented

the decrease in investment income on funds held and other is primarily attributable to one life annuity treaty  which reported lower investment income and losses during compared to the increase in investment expense in over is primarily a result of the company s larger asset base upon which expenses are incurred as well as the internalization of the equity portfolio management 
current economic indicators continue to suggest moderate global economic growth led by the us economy

the general decline in interest rates in the last two years has resulted in a significant increase in the fair value of the company s fixed income portfolio  as the prevailing market interest rates were lower than the average coupon rate of the company s fixed income portfolio 
during the normal course of its operations the company bought and sold securities to take advantage of market conditions 
since most of the securities in the fixed income portfolio carried unrealized gains during  the sale of securities generated realized investment gains and reduced the unrealized investment gains recorded in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
there was no impact on total comprehensive income and no change in the total value of shareholders equity as a result of the realization of these gains 
the realized investment gains for the year ended december  increased over as the company had a higher volume of purchases and sales during the period  which resulted in the realization of more unrealized gains

the company employs a conservative investment philosophy 
it maintains a high quality  well balanced and liquid portfolio having the dual objectives of optimizing current income and achieving capital appreciation 
the company s investment strategy allows the use of derivative securities  subject to strict limitations 
derivative instruments may be used to replicate investment positions or to manage market exposures that would be allowed under the company s investment policy if implemented in other ways 
from a risk management perspective  the company divides its invested assets into two categories  liability funds and capital funds  which are comprised of total investments and cash and accrued investment income 
liability funds represent invested assets supporting the net reinsurance liabilities  defined as the company s reinsurance liabilities net of the reinsurance assets  and are invested entirely in high quality fixed income securities 
the preservation of liquidity and protection of capital are the primary investment objectives for these assets 
the portfolio managers are required to follow strict investment guidelines as to minimum ratings  and issuer and sector concentrations 
capital fund assets represent the capital of the company and are invested to maximize total return  subject to strict risk assumption and portfolio diversification guidelines  including issuer and sector 
table of contents concentration limitations 
capital funds may be invested in investment grade fixed income securities  less than investment grade bonds  convertible securities  preferred stocks and common stocks 
the company believes that an allocation of a portion of its investments to equities is both prudent and desirable as it helps to achieve broader asset diversification and maximizes the portfolio s total return over time 
since the company s allocation to equities is predicated on a long term strategic investment in this asset class  the company has the ability and fully expects to withstand the effects of cyclical market value swings of the broader equity markets on its portfolio 
at december   the liability funds totaled billion and were comprised of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  aaa  aa and a rated fixed income securities 
the capital funds  which totaled billion  were comprised of investment grade fixed income securities  less than investment grade bonds  convertible securities and equity securities 
approximately of the invested assets currently held by the company are publicly traded and  accordingly  market valuations for such securities are readily available 
for those securities not publicly traded of the company s invested assets or approximately million  consisting primarily of non publicly traded companies  non publicly traded real estate funds  private placement equity investments and other specialty asset classes  valuation techniques depend on the nature of the individual asset 
the valuation techniques used by the company s investment managers are reviewed by the company and are generally commensurate with standard valuation techniques for each asset class 
at december  and  fixed maturities  short term investments and cash and cash equivalents had an average yield to maturity at market of

for accounting purposes  the company s investment portfolio is categorized according to two distinct accounting classifications available for sale and trading securities 
for a description of the different accounting treatments afforded to these separate accounting classifications  see note f to consolidated financial statements 
at december   investments classified as available for sale comprised of the company s total portfolio excluding cash and cash equivalents and other invested assets with being classified as trading securities 
included in the available for sale category is the company s portfolio of fixed maturity investments  comprised primarily of investment grade securities issued by the us government or us government sponsored agencies  state and foreign governments  corporate debt securities and equity securities 
in addition  as part of its investment strategy  the company invests a small percentage of its portfolio in less than investment grade bonds  which are also classified as available for sale 
the company also has an allocation to convertible securities in its investment portfolio that are classified as trading securities

the following table provides a breakdown of the credit quality of the company s fixed income securities at december  of total fixed income securities rating category aaa aa a bbb below investment grade unrated at december   the company had gross unrealized losses on its fixed maturities of million  of which million was attributable to investment grade securities and million was attributable to securities rated less than investment grade 

table of contents the company s investment security with the largest net unrealized loss at december   for which an other than temporary impairment charge has not been taken was a net unrealized loss of million  representing of the amortized cost of the security  which is rated aaa 
this unrealized loss  as well as a majority of the company s total unrealized losses on fixed maturities securities  are due to changes in interest rates 
typically  as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall  and vice versa 
the company believes that these decreases in value are temporary under current accounting guidance  and additional analysis of individual securities for potential other than temporary impairments was carried out by the company to validate its belief 
as of december   the company had no significant unrealized losses  for which an other than temporary impairment charge has not been taken  caused by other factors and circumstances  including an issuer s specific corporate risk or due to industry or geographic risk 
additionally  the company has the intent and ability to retain such investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any recovery in fair value

the company recorded charges for other than temporary impairments relating to its investment portfolio in the aggregate amount of million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
typically  the company considers impairment to have occurred when events specific to a particular issuer have occurred that are likely to prevent the company from recovering its initial investment in the security 
in the determination of other than temporary impairments  the company considers several factors and circumstances  including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  general economic and financial market conditions  the length of time for which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below cost or amortized cost on a continuous basis  and factors that may raise doubt about the issuer s ability to continue as a going concern 
other than temporary impairments are recorded as realized investment losses in the consolidated statements of operations  which reduces net income and net income per share 
temporary losses are recorded as unrealized investment losses  which do not impact net income and net income per share but reduce accumulated other comprehensive income  except for those related to trading securities  which are recorded immediately in net income 
see note p to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of eitf issue no 

as mentioned above  the company s asset managers have the dual investment objectives of optimizing current income and achieving capital appreciation 
to meet these objectives  it is often desirable to sell securities when opportunities for superior expected returns are identified 
accordingly  recognition of realized gains and losses is considered by the company to be a typical consequence of the ongoing investment management activities 

table of contents funds held by reinsured companies the company writes certain business on a funds held basis 
as of december  and  the company recorded  million and  million  respectively  of funds held assets on its consolidated balance sheets  representing and  respectively  of the company s total assets 
under such contractual arrangements  the reinsured retains the net funds that would have otherwise been remitted to the company and credits the net fund balance with investment income 
in general  the purpose of the funds held balances is to provide the reinsured with additional security that the company will honor its obligations 
the company is subject to the credit risk of the reinsured in the event of insolvency or the reinsured s failure to honor the value of the funds held balances for any other reason 
however  the company s credit risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company has the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the company to the reinsured for losses payable and other amounts contractually due 
approximately of the funds held assets at december  earns investment income based upon a predetermined interest rate  either fixed contractually at the inception of the contract or based upon a recognized market index eg  libor 
interest rates at december   ranged from to 
under these contractual arrangements  there are no specific assets linked to the funds held balances and the company is exposed only to the credit risk of the reinsured 
with respect to the remainder of the funds held assets at december   the company receives an investment return based upon either the results of a pool of assets held by the reinsured generally used as collateral for the funds held assets  or the investment return earned by the reinsured on its entire investment portfolio 
the company does not legally own or directly control the investments underlying its funds held assets and only has recourse to the reinsured for the receivable balances and no claim to the underlying securities that support the balances 
decisions as to purchases and sales of assets underlying the funds held balances are made by the reinsured  in some circumstances  investment guidelines regarding the minimum credit quality of the underlying assets may be agreed upon between the reinsured and the company as part of the reinsurance agreement or the company may participate in an investment oversight committee regarding the investment of the net funds  but investment decisions are not otherwise influenced by the company 
within this portion of the funds held assets  the company has several annuity treaties  which are structured so that the return on the funds held balances is tied to the performance of an underlying group of assets held by the reinsured  including fluctuations in the market value of the underlying assets one such treaty is a retrocessional agreement under which the company receives less data than is generally received under a direct reinsurance agreement 
in these arrangements  the objective of the reinsurance agreement is to provide for the covered longevity risk and to earn a net investment return on an underlying pool of assets greater than is contractually due to the annuity holders 
while the company is also exposed to the creditworthiness of the reinsured  the risk of loss to the company is somewhat mitigated  as the company has the ability to offset a shortfall in the funds held assets with amounts owed to the reinsured 
the company also has several property and casualty treaties in which the investment performance of the net funds held corresponds to the interest income on the assets held by the reinsured  however  the company is not directly exposed to the underlying credit risk of these investments  as they serve only as collateral for the company s receivables 
that is  the amount owed to the company is unaffected by changes in the market value of the investments underlying the funds 
in those cases where the company is exposed to the credit or interest rate risk of an underlying pool of assets  the company has applied the guidance of derivative implementation issue no 
b embedded derivatives modified coinsurance arrangements and debt instruments that incorporate credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the obligor under those instruments 
accordingly  the company has recognized as a realized gain or loss the value of the credit and or interest rate derivative embedded within the funds held balance 
in the case of the company s annuity contracts  there is also a resulting offsetting adjustment to deferred acquisition costs related to this business 
at december   the cumulative value of such embedded derivatives was determined to be approximately million  which is offset by an equivalent adjustment to deferred acquisition costs 

table of contents unpaid losses and loss expenses the company s unpaid losses and loss expenses for its non life operations are composed of the reserves for its non life and art segments 
at december  and  the company recorded gross non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses of  million and  million  respectively  and net non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses of  million and  million  respectively 
during  the company incurred net non life losses and loss expenses of  million and paid net non life losses and loss expenses of  million 
additionally  the weakening of the us dollar against most european currencies during resulted in an increase of the non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses of million 
the non life ratio of paid losses to net premiums earned was while the non life ratio of paid losses to incurred losses was for the year ended december   respectively 
policy benefits for life and annuity contracts were  million and  million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the value of reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses relates primarily to the overall growth in business 
the company establishes loss reserves to cover the estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the contracts that the company writes 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability 
loss reserves are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time to reflect the company s expectations of the costs of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims 
estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events 
the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates 
management believes that the recorded unpaid losses and loss expenses represent the best estimate of the cost to settle the ultimate liabilities based on information available at december  the company s reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses include an estimate for its net ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims of million and million at december  and  respectively 
ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques 
there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses for these claims and these uncertainties are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
the company actively evaluates potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and establishes additional reserves as appropriate 
the company believes that it has made a reasonable provision for these exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would materially affect its estimates 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of its business the company is a party to a variety of contractual obligations as summarized below 
these contractual obligations are considered by the company when assessing its liquidity requirements and the company is confident in its ability to meet all of its obligations

included in the total credit facilities available to the company at december   is a million three year syndicated  unsecured credit facility 
this facility was executed in june on substantially the same terms and 
table of contents conditions as the maturing facility  except for the term of the facility  which was extended from days to three years  and an increase in the minimum consolidated tangible net worth that the company must maintain  to reflect the growth in the company s capital since the inception of the facility 
some of the credit facilities contain customary default and cross default provisions and require that the company maintain certain covenants 
the company s breach of any of the covenants would result in an event of default  upon which the company would likely be required to repay any outstanding borrowings and replace or cash collateralize letters of credit issued under these facilities 
at december   the company was not in breach of any of the covenants under its facilities 
additionally  the syndicated unsecured credit facility allows for an adjustment to the level of pricing should the company experience a change in its senior unsecured credit rating 
the pricing grid provides the company greater flexibility and simultaneously provides participants under the facility some price protection 
as long as the company maintains a minimum rating of a or better  the pricing on the facility will not change significantly

the company participated in the remarketing of the series b preferred shares and as a result purchased of the outstanding series b preferred shares 
the series b preferred shares were subsequently cancelled and are no longer outstanding

liquidity cash flows from operations for increased to  million from  million in this increase in cash flows is primarily attributable to the significant increase in business written by the company and an increase in net investment income 
the company is a holding company with no operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries 
the company relies primarily on cash dividends and payments from partner reinsurance  partnerre sa and partnerre us to pay the operating expenses  shareholder dividends and other obligations of the holding company that may arise from time to time 
the company expects future dividends and other permitted payments from these subsidiaries to be the principal source of its funds to pay expenses and dividends 
although the payment of dividends by the reinsurance subsidiaries to the company is limited under bermuda and french laws and certain insurance statutes of various us states in which partnerre us is

cash outflows are in the form of claims payments  operating expenses as well as dividend payments to the holding company  and additionally  in the case of partnerre us holdings  interest payments on the long term debt and the trust preferred securities 
historically  the operating subsidiaries of the company have generated sufficient cash flows to meet all of their obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of the business written by the company  cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly between periods 
some of the company s reinsurance treaties contain special funding and termination clauses that are triggered in the event the company or one of its subsidiaries is downgraded by one of the major rating agencies to levels specified in the treaties  or the company s capital is significantly reduced

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview management believes that the company is principally exposed to four types of market related risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
how these risks relate to the company  and the process used to manage them  is discussed below 
as discussed previously  the company s investment philosophy distinguishes between assets that are generally matched against the estimated net reinsurance assets and liabilities liability funds and those assets that represent shareholder capital capital funds 
at december   liability funds represented or billion of the company s total invested assets 
liability funds are invested in a way that matches them to the corresponding liabilities in both duration and currency composition 
this procedure seeks to immunize the company against changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
as the focus of this discussion is to identify risk exposures that impact the market value of assets alone  it is important for the reader to recognize that the risks discussed herein are significantly mitigated to the extent that the company s investment strategy allows market forces to influence the economic valuation of both assets and liabilities in generally the same way 
at december   capital funds represented or billion of the company s total invested assets 
these assets represent shareholders capital and they are invested in a diversified portfolio that has the objective of maximizing investment return  subject to prudent risk constraints 
capital funds contain most of the asset classes typically viewed as offering a higher risk  higher return profile primarily common stock  convertible and high yield bonds  private equity investments and real estate  in addition to high quality investment grade securities 
the company s investment philosophy is to reduce foreign currency risk on capital funds by investing primarily in us dollar investments 
in considering the market risk of capital funds  it is important to recognize the benefits of portfolio diversification 
although these asset classes in isolation may introduce more risk into the portfolio  market forces have a tendency to influence each class in different ways and at different times 
consequently  the aggregate risk introduced by a portfolio of these assets should be less than might be estimated by summing the individual risks 
the company s investment strategy allows the use of derivative securities  subject to strict limitations 
derivative instruments may be used to hedge market risk  or to replicate investment positions or market exposures that would be allowed under the company s investment policy if implemented in other ways 
the use of financial leverage  whether achieved through derivatives or margin borrowing  is prohibited without the express approval of the board of directors 
the company also imposes a high standard for the credit quality of counterparties in all investment derivative transactions 
see note k to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures concerning derivatives 
the following comments address those areas where the company believes it has exposure to material market risk in its operations 
interest rate risk the company s fixed income portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall  and vice versa 
the company manages interest rate risk on liability funds by constructing bond portfolios in which the economic impact of a general interest rate shift is comparable to the impact on the related liabilities 
this process involves matching the duration of the investment portfolio to the estimated duration of the liabilities 
for loss reserves and policy benefits related to non life and traditional life business  the estimated duration of the company s liabilities is based on projected claims payout patterns 
for policy benefits related to life and annuity business  the company estimates duration based on its commitment to annuitants 
the company believes that this matching process mitigates the overall interest rate risk on an economic basis 

table of contents while this matching of duration insulates the company from the economic impact of interest rate changes  it does impact the net reported us gaap equity of the company 
the company s liabilities are carried at their nominal value  which is not adjusted for changes in interest rates  however  the company s invested assets are carried at fair market value  which is adjusted for such changes 
as a result  a decrease in interest rates will result in an increase in the fair value of the company s investments and a corresponding increase  net of applicable taxes  to the company s equity 
an increase in interest rates would have the opposite effect 
as discussed above  a portion of the fixed income portfolio is designated as capital funds 
the company manages the exposure to interest rate volatility on capital funds by choosing a duration profile that it believes will optimize the risk reward relationship 
at december   the company held approximately  million of its total invested assets in mortgage asset backed securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  the adverse impact of which is more evident in a declining interest rate environment 
in such an environment  holders of individual mortgages increase the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and refinance at lower interest cost 
this can cause an acceleration of cash payments from the securities and a diminution of future investment income relative to an equivalent fixed income security without prepayment risk 
at december   the company estimates that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates across all currencies would result in a million decrease or increase  respectively  in the market value of its fixed income portfolio including mortgage related securities 
this change does not take into account taxes or the corresponding decrease or increase  respectively  in the economic value of its reinsurance liabilities  which  as noted above  would substantially offset the negative effect on invested assets as an economic matter  although the offset would not be reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
as noted above  the company strives to match the foreign currency exposure in its fixed income portfolio to its multicurrency liabilities 
the company believes that this matching process creates a diversification benefit 
consequently  the exact market value effect of a change in interest rates will depend on which countries experience interest rate changes and the foreign currency mix of the company s fixed income portfolio at the time of the interest rate changes 
see foreign currency risk 
interest rate movements also affect the economic value of the company s outstanding fixed rate debt obligation and preferred securities in the same way that they affect the company s fixed income investments  and this can result in a liability whose economic value is different from the value reported on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company believes that the economic fair values and carrying values of its outstanding fixed rate debt and preferred securities at december   were as follows in millions of us dollars carrying value fair value long term debt trust preferred securities series c cumulative preferred shares series d cumulative preferred shares neither the trust that issued the securities nor partnerre finance  which owns the trust  meets the consolidation requirements of fin r 
accordingly  the company shows the related intercompany debt of million on its consolidated balance sheets 
fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt has been calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate reflective of market interest rates  which is lower than the original interest rate on the debt of 
for the company s trust preferred securities  series c cumulative preferred shares and series d cumulative preferred shares  fair value is based on quoted market prices  while carrying value is based on the liquidation value of the securities 

table of contents foreign currency risk through its multinational reinsurance operations  the company conducts business in a variety of non us currencies  with the principal exposures being the euro  the british pound  the swiss franc  the canadian dollar and the japanese yen 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
as the company s reporting currency is the us dollar  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may materially impact the company s consolidated statements of operations and financial position 
however  the company employs several strategies to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
even though the company is able to match its liability funds against its insurance related liabilities both by currency and duration  resulting in a natural hedge  it does enter into designated hedges to protect the value of its investment portfolio 
additionally  the company does not maintain invested assets in currencies for which its liability exposures are not material or in countries where it is unable or impractical to maintain investments 
in such cases  the company does not have such a natural hedge and is exposed to foreign currency risk 
however  the company does not believe that the foreign currency risks corresponding to these unhedged positions are material 
for the main non us dollar currencies identified above in which the company transacts business  the company employs a hedging strategy utilizing derivative financial instruments  as appropriate  to ensure that its liability funds are matched by currency 
to the extent that the company has net asset positions invested in non us dollar currencies  forward currency contracts and other derivatives may be used to hedge these non us dollar currency exposures 
see note k to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company s currency hedging activities 
as a second strategy  the company maintains capital funds primarily in us dollar investments 
an additional factor mitigating the company s foreign currency risk is the ongoing nature of its reinsurance operations 
cash receipts in foreign currencies from premiums can be used to pay claims and expenses incurred in the same currency 
at december   of the company s total investments were in us dollar denominated instruments and were non us dollar investments 
the table below summarizes the company s gross and net exposure on its december  consolidated balance sheet to foreign currency as well as the associated foreign currency derivatives the company has put in place to manage this exposure in millions of us dollars euro gbp cad chf jpy other total invested assets other net liabilities total foreign currency risk total derivative amount net foreign currency exposure as the us dollar is the company s reporting currency  there is no currency risk attached to the us dollar and it is excluded from this table 
the us dollar accounted for the difference between the company s total foreign currency risk in this table and the invested assets and other net liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s investment in partnerre sa  whose functional currency is the euro  and its canadian branch  whose functional currency is the canadian dollar  accounted for million or of the total foreign currency exposure noted above  which the company does not hedge 
assuming all other variables are held constant and disregarding any tax effects  a change in the us dollar relative to the other currencies held by the company would result in a million change in the net assets held by the company  inclusive of the effect of the derivative hedges 

table of contents credit risk the company has exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
the company controls this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities it purchases 
at december   approximately of the company s fixed income portfolio was rated aaa or equivalent rating and was rated a or better 
at december   of the company s fixed income portfolio was rated below investment grade 
these percentages were comparable to december  the company believes this high quality concentration significantly reduces its exposure to credit risk on these fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
to a lesser extent  the company also has credit risk exposure as a party to foreign currency forward contracts and other derivative contracts 
these contracts are generally of short duration approximately days and settle on a net basis  which means that the company is exposed to the movement of one currency against the other as opposed to the nominal amount of the contracts 
at december   the company s absolute nominal value of foreign exchange forward contracts was  million while the net value of those contracts was million 
to mitigate this risk  the company monitors its exposure by counterparty and ensures that counterparties to these contracts are high credit quality international banks or counterparties 
the company is also exposed to credit risk in its underwriting operations  most notably in the credit surety line and in the business written by the company s art operations 
loss experience in these lines of business is cyclical and is affected by the state of the general economic environment 
the company provides its clients in these lines of business with reinsurance protection against credit deterioration  defaults or other types of financial non performance of or by the underlying credits that are the subject of the reinsurance provided and  accordingly  the company is exposed to the credit risk of those credits 
as with all of the company s business  these risks are subject to rigorous underwriting and pricing standards 
in addition  the company strives to mitigate the risks associated with these credit sensitive lines of business through the use of risk management techniques such as risk diversification  careful monitoring of risk aggregations and accumulations and  at times  through the use of retrocessional reinsurance protection and the purchase of credit default swaps 
the company is subject to the credit risk of the reinsured in the event of insolvency or the reinsured s failure to honor the value of the funds held balances for any other reason 
however  the company s credit risk is mitigated by the fact that the company has the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the company to the reinsured for losses payable and other amounts contractually due 
funds held balances for which the company receives an investment return based upon either the results of a pool of assets held by the reinsured or the investment return earned by the reinsured on its investment portfolio are also exposed to credit risk 
the company is exposed to a limited extent to the underlying financial market risk of the pool of assets  inasmuch as the underlying policies may have guaranteed minimum returns 
while the company is also exposed to the creditworthiness of the reinsured  the risk of loss to the company is somewhat mitigated  as the company has the ability to offset a shortfall in the funds held assets with amounts owed to the reinsured 
the company has exposure to credit risk as it relates to its trade balances receivable  namely reinsurance balances receivable and reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses 
reinsurance balances receivable from the company s clients at december   were  million 
the company believes that credit risk exposure related to these balances is mitigated by several factors  including but not limited to credit checks performed as part of the underwriting process and monitoring of aged receivable balances 
in addition  as the vast majority of the reinsurance agreements permit the company the right to offset premiums receivable from the clients against losses payable to them  the company believes that the credit risk in this area is substantially reduced 
the company does not rely heavily on retrocessional reinsurance  but does require its reinsurers to have very high financial strength ratings 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors its concentration of credit risk on an ongoing basis 
provisions are made  as necessary  for amounts considered 
table of contents potentially uncollectible 
the balance of reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses at december   was million 
the amount of the allowance provided for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable was million at december  equity price risk the company invests a portion of its capital funds in marketable equity securities  million at december  
these assets include equity investments as well as bank loans 
these assets are exposed to equity price risk  defined as the potential for loss in market value due to a decline in equity prices 
the company reviews this class of assets on a regular basis to ensure that diversification strategies to manage this risk continue to be in place 
the company believes that the effects of diversification and the relatively small size of the existing investment in equities relative to the total investments mitigate its exposure to equity price risk 
the company estimates that its equity investment portfolio has a beta versus the s p index of approximately 
beta measures the response of an individual s stock performance relative to a market return  where a beta of would be an equivalent return to the index 
given the estimated beta for the company s portfolio  a movement in the s p would result in an approximately increase or decrease in the market value of the company s equity portfolio
