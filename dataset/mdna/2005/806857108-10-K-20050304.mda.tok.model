item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of results should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
summary schlumberger consists of two business segments oilfield services and westerngeco 
the year marked the transformation of schlumberger into a pure oilfield services company with a clear record for growth and technology leadership 
income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest was billion in compared to million in the and results include pretax charges of million and million  respectively  which are described in detail on pages to the growth in earnings from continuing operations far exceeded the growth in revenue 
oilfield services reached new revenue and pretax operating income records of billion and billion  respectively 
strong growth was experienced in all areas  but most notably in north america  middle east and asia 
pretax return on sales for the full year was  considerably higher than the objective set in march of westerngeco returned to profitability with pretax operating income of million versus a loss of million in our approach has been threefold to bring capacity and cost down to appropriate levels  to take a cautious approach to new investment in the data library  and to continue aggressive introduction of q technology 
the keys to success are industry discipline in managing capacity but above all clear demonstration of the differentiation in q technology 
q revenue more than doubled from million in to million in our divestiture program of non oilfield businesses is now complete 
during  we finalized the sale of schlumbergersema  completed the initial public offering of axalto  and divested of substantially all remaining non oilfield businesses 
as a result net debt fell below billion at december  and is at a level consistent with the longer term capital structure of schlumberger 
in may  schlumberger completed the acquisition of a equity stake in petroalliance  russia s largest independent oilfield service company 
a further stake is expected to be acquired in the first half of we also finalized the acquisition of sgk  a joint venture with which we have been associated with for the past four years in russia 
the market potential in russia is substantial  and this type of investment will benefit schlumberger and the russian oil industry by facilitating growth through access to technology 
in june  we outlined our growth strategy with a particular focus on the production oriented environment 
new and increased investment in additional production capacity  largely in the international and deepwater markets where schlumberger is strongest  coupled with the requirement to prolong production from existing reservoirs  will be reflected in higher levels of oilfield service activity for many years to come 
seventy percent of today s oil production comes from fields that have been in production for more than thirty years 
as these fields continue to age  their performance declines and remedial actions are required to maintain their output 
the significance of this can be seen from the fact that as much as three quarters of today s investment in the upstream industry is directed at such activity with the remaining quarter being spent on developing new sources of oil for the future 
there are three key avenues that schlumberger intends to exploit in addition to maintaining our leading position in exploration and development technology for harsh and complex environments 
first  schlumberger already has broad geographical spread 
however  our strong positions in the strategically important areas for new production in the middle east  the caspian and in deepwater regions provide a unique growth opportunity 
schlumberger sees the largest opportunity to be in russia as well as to some extent in china 
the second avenue for growth is through technology  both developed internally and acquired externally 
a wide range of internally developed products and services has created a portfolio targeted at growth in the production oriented market 
schlumberger s research and engineering expenditures have been relatively constant while the rate of introduction of new products and services is accelerating 
we consider complementary technology acquisition with subsequent enhancement and integration into our portfolio to be an on going feature of our future growth 
the third avenue of growth for schlumberger will be our ability to perform reservoir oriented project management 
conceived largely as a well construction business  and confirmed by successful execution of projects such as burgos in mexico  integrated project management ipm is now developing more and more expertise in the execution of projects designed to boost production in mature areas 
early in  we set a number of new financial goals for the company 
these included the anticipation that the compound annual growth rate in revenue would be in double digits throughout the remainder of the decade although such growth may not be linear as the industry will remain to some extent cyclical  an after tax return on sales target  before minority interests  of including westerngeco  and a target return on capital employed consistently in the upper teens 
the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
stated in millions change oilfield services operating revenue pretax segment income westerngeco operating revenue pretax segment income pretax segment income represents income before taxes and minority interest  excluding interest income  interest expense  amortization of intangibles and pretax charges of million in and million in see pages to for description of charges 
oilfield services as the year progressed  oil prices continued to climb  rising from per barrel on january st to per barrel at the end of june to a record of over per barrel in late october 
despite oil trading on average some per barrel higher in than in  robust world demand growth of over million barrels per day continued throughout the second half of consumption  especially in the us and china  pushed demand to an average million barrels per day in  a year on year growth of and the sharpest growth rate since supply growth in was restrained by a number of factors that  when added together resulted in an extremely tight supply demand balance that pushed prices higher than prior year forecasts 
the factors that created this tight environment are expected to remain in  including strong oil demand  geopolitical tension  a stretched refining system  relatively low crude and product inventories  limited spare production capacity and a weak us dollar 
accordingly  most forecasts call for some early softening in prices after a relatively mild winter followed by average oil prices at or slightly above levels 
the main risks to this scenario remain a dramatic slowing of world economic growth and supply side disruption 
upstream exploration and production e p spending trended higher in  up an estimated over international spending  accounting for over of the total  saw the largest gain of  while north america was up 
exploration spending remained flat in while development and production saw the majority of the increase as operators focused on maintaining production in aging fields 
worldwide rig counts were up over the outlook for remains robust with the industry now clearly focused on the need to build additional supply capacity for both oil and gas 
this is evidenced by increased new field development plans  as well as unprecedented efforts to increase production and recovery from existing reservoirs 
exploration  especially in challenging environments such as deep water  should see a substantial increase in strong market fundamentals  our extensive technology portfolio and unique global workforce make us ideally placed to grow in this environment 
results revenue of billion increased in versus north america increased  middle east asia increased  and latin america increased 
europe cis west africa was up by 
pretax operating income of billion in was higher than in activity increased in almost all regions with the largest growth recorded in the geomarkets in india  mexico  russia  east africa and the eastern mediterranean  and the caspian 
russia continued to make impressive progress with growth exceeding our expectations despite the absence of any activity for yuganskneftegas at the end of the year 
demand for all technology services increased  but particularly for drilling measurements technologies including the powerdrive and newly introduced powerv rotary steerable systems as well as wireline analysis behind casing and pressurexpress services 
increased demand for well services production technologies also contributed significantly to the growth 
these technologies included the successful launch of the powerclean system  an integrated solution for optimizing production through wellbore fill removal using coiled tubing 
the well completions productivity technology service also showed strong growth for production based technologies while ipm activity continued its expansion 
the rate of new technology introductions is expected to accelerate over the coming two year period 
offshore and deepwater activity in india utilizing wireline  drilling measurements and well completions productivity technologies continued to drive significant year on year growth 
growth in india was supported by the award of a completion sales tender for subsurface safety valves and a three year contract for wireline logging on onshore fields for ongc valued at more than million 
during the year schlumberger opened a technology hub on the campus of the gubkin russian state university of oil and gas  russia s leading oil and gas educational facility 
the hub complements other schlumberger research and engineering activities in russia 
shell international exploration and production bv and schlumberger information solutions established an alliance for research and development of next generation smart fields hydrocarbon development solutions 
north america revenue of billion increased over led principally by canada and us land  which benefited from the strong performance of most technology services  coupled with pricing improvements particularly for well services 
growth in canada was due to increased activity and substantially higher pricing 
us land delivered robust revenue growth primarily due to continued favorable oil and gas industry dynamics  the expansion of the unconventional gas market  an improved pricing environment as a result of tighter resource availability  and strong overall market demand combined with increasing demand for abc analysis behind casing technologies  and drilling measurements powerdrive rotary steerable systems 
these technology advances are demonstrating value and are helping drive activity while enabling price increases and efficiency gains 
pretax operating income of million was higher than in due mainly to increased operating leverage in us land  with double digit price improvements in wireline and well services over averages 
in canada  increased activity coupled with sustained pricing improvements  and the favorable exchange rate effect led to a notable improvement in operating income 
at the end of the year  the technology component of turnkey service revenue in the gulf of mexico was evaluated against our objectives but proved insufficient to outweigh the risk associated with the turnkey drilling business model 
as a result  the decision was made to exit the activity 
latin america revenue of billion grew over as all the geomarkets  except venezuela  posted revenue increases 
record revenue in mexico was mainly due to pemex drilling activity coupled with higher levels of ipm activity 
increasing demand for integrated project management in argentina  an increase in wireline activity associated with the peruvian jungle operations  and growing demand for rotary steerable systems in brazil also contributed to the revenue growth 
in venezuela  revenue decreased slightly on lower activity with pdvsa due to ongoing contract negotiation on certain integrated projects 
pretax operating income of million was flat over the substantial revenue growth did not materialize into higher operating income mainly because of a larger contribution of schlumberger managed third party services on ipm projects in mexico as well as an unfavorable revenue mix in mexico 
additionally  throughout the year  certain barges in west venezuela were partially idled while contractual negotiations continued with pdvsa 
a key contract award during the fourth quarter of included a new well ipm contract in the burgos basin for pemex in mexico 
the multi year contract value is estimated at million and will include drilling and completion work for development and appraisal gas wells 
europe cis west africa revenue of billion increased over mainly due to russia  the caspian and west africa with gains recorded in all technology services led by drilling measurements and well services 
cis reached a new revenue record at million  a increase over activity was particularly sustained in russia mainly due to the continued expansion of the customer base and the deployment of new production related technologies 
the revenue growth was tempered by the halt of activities for yuganskneftegas in russia in the fourth quarter 
however  successful redeployment of the equipment previously working for yuganskneftegas was completed by the end of the year 
west africa continued to deliver robust performance achieving record activity levels mainly due to the development of deepwater projects combined with price increases through the introduction of new services and increasing demand for well services and well completions productivity technology services 
pretax operating income of million declined over mainly due to persistent union strikes in norway  redeployment costs and associated decreased operating efficiency in russia  weak results in north africa  and the appreciation of local currencies against the us dollar 
these were partially offset by the continued strengthening of activity in continental europe and the caspian 
in russia  sibneft awarded schlumberger a contract for more than million to provide well construction and stimulation services in western siberia 
middle east asia revenue in reached a record of billion  increasing over the geomarkets in the middle east  malaysia and india primarily drove the growth 
activity in saudi arabia was focused on increasing production capacity  which resulted in higher levels of drilling activity throughout the year 
this trend is expected to continue in india reached record revenue with the ramp up in deepwater activity for ongc and deepwater exploration activity for reliance industries ltd 
activity in qatar continued to increase due to ongoing gas development projects in the north field 
also contributing to the record revenue level was the start of a new fracturing campaign in oman 
demand for well completions productivity technologies was particularly strong  mainly in the gulf from projects with rasgas  in saudi arabia from the commissioning of the abu safah project  and in malaysia from higher testing activities and artificial lift sales 
pretax operating income of million increased over primarily driven by india  due to a substantial increase in deepwater activity combined with strong technology deployment  the ramp up of favorable projects in the gulf  improved pricing on contract renewals  and new technology introductions 
key technology solutions that were deployed included the chdt cased hole dynamic tester tool  part of the suite of abc analysis behind casing technology services  was used to identify a high pressured zone in a depleted reservoir in china  to acquire pressures and fluid samples in saudi arabia and abu dhabi  and to acquire samples and pressure readings in malaysia 
in the gulf  demonstrated service quality and the introduction of new technology services led to the award of major contracts in qatar and oman 
these included a million  multi year wireline and tubing conveyed perforating contract by petroleum development oman pdo for their north and south operations 
results revenue of billion increased in versus led by north america with an increase of  followed by latin america and middle east asia  which both increased  and europe cis west africa  which was up 
pretax operating income of billion in was higher than in  primarily due to strong customer demand resulting from increased e p expenditures and customer acceptance of new technologies 
overhead cost savings of million generated from restructuring and downsizing efforts  principally in europe cis west africa and north south america  also contributed to the increased profitability during the year 
oilfield services began the year with relatively flat revenue in the first quarter  then achieved modest  but continuous growth over the following three quarters due to new contracts  the introduction of new technologies  and increased demand for integrated project management 
the results were positively impacted by an upturn in natural gas drilling in north america  and increased activity in mexico  russia and the middle east  partially offset by a nationwide strike in venezuela and unrest in nigeria 
all technology product lines helped drive revenue growth 
well services and drilling measurements record levels of revenue contributed to more than half of the increase in oilfield services revenue 
data consulting services drew the award of several contracts for reservoir modeling  field development planning  and production optimization 
integrated project management experienced high activity levels principally fueled by latin america 
north america north america revenue of billion increased versus the growth in revenue was mainly due to increased activity in us land  as well as canada 
both markets were driven by strong commodity prices  which  in turn  were caused by the record low gas storage levels at the end of the drawdown season 
this growth was not mirrored in the gulf of mexico where activity was essentially flat year on year 
pretax operating income of million increased over primarily due to a beneficial fall through resulting from improved equipment utilization in us land following asset rationalization and cost containment 
increased demand for drilling measurements  cased hole wireline and hydraulic fracturing solutions  related to increased complexity in developing new gas reserves in us land  also contributed to profitability improvement 
latin america latin america revenue of billion increased versus primarily due to substantial increases in mexico  brazil and argentina  partially offset by a significant decline in venezuela 
large scale project management contracts substantially accounted for the growth in activity in mexico 
growth in brazil was driven by a strong increase in petrobras exploration activity  and argentina benefited from the high oil price 
the political turmoil in the early part of the year substantially impacted results in venezuela  however the focus on restoring production favorably drove the revenue in the latter half of the year 
the increase in e p spending in mexico was driven by the compelling need to satisfy the domestic demand for natural gas  increase the light oil production and ramp up the oil production potential 
key contracts that contributed to revenue growth included project management of a four year  million integrated oilfield services project which represents the most significant oil development project in mexico in the last years 
pretax operating income of million was up year on year with all areas excluding venezuela contributing to improved profitability 
there were record levels of integrated project management contracts in mexico and positive fall through on incremental revenue in argentina and brazil 
europe cis west africa revenue of billion increased over  primarily in russia due to growth in e p spending and continued expansion of the addressable market  which drove increased fracturing activity  high sales of artificial lift pumps  and the adoption of more advanced drilling technologies 
cis reached a record revenue level of million  higher than an increase in the number of e p companies entering the development phase of deepwater projects in west africa during the second half of also contributed to overall activity improvement in the area  principally in well completions productivity and well services technologies 
these results were partially offset by lower exploration activity by the major oil companies in the north sea and by production shutdowns in the western niger delta in nigeria due to socio political unrest 
pretax operating income of million increased over primarily due to cost savings generated at the beginning of the year  as well as increased activities in west africa due to deepwater activities moving into a more lucrative development phase 
middle east asia revenue of billion increased over with more than half the growth coming from saudi arabia kuwait  egypt and indonesia 
despite geopolitical uncertainty in the period leading up to the war in iraq and relative softness in asia principally caused by the sars outbreak  revenue showed marked improvement primarily due to higher demand for drilling measurements  wireline and well completion productivity technologies in egypt  saudi arabia kuwait and indonesia partially offset by reduced activity in malaysia brunei philippines due to the suspension of planned deepwater development work resulting from the deepwater acreage dispute between malaysia and brunei 
pretax operating income of million increased  primarily due to the operating leverage on increased revenue across most geomarkets  principally caused by increased activity in indonesia and stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in east africa 
results revenue for was billion versus billion in reflecting reduced activity in north america and latin america  which was partially mitigated by higher activity in europe cis w 
africa and the middle east asia 
pretax operating income of billion decreased primarily from reduced margins in wireline and well services as activity declined in north america 
a sharp fall in revenue at the beginning of reflected declining activity levels in north america  which remained depressed for the remainder of the year  together with political and economic uncertainty in latin america 
in the second and third quarters  robust activity in europe cis w 
africa  and signs of a possible recovery in asia  mitigated the effects of low north american drilling levels resulting in increased revenue 
however  this trend was short lived as slower activity outside north america  due mainly to seasonal influences  coupled with budget cuts  resulted in lower fourth quarter revenue 
from a technology standpoint  the strongest performer was well completions productivity where acquisitions  testing  advanced completions systems and artificial lift technology showed market share gains 
during  schlumberger acquired a 
comeau associates limited  a leading provider of electrical engineering products and services for artificially lifted wells 
this addition  combined with the successful integration of sensa and phoenix technologies into the schlumberger artificial lift services portfolio  contributed to higher sales in  particularly in the eastern hemisphere 
the drilling measurements technology service also recorded solid revenue growth fuelled largely by the continued penetration of the powerdrive rotary steerable system into new geomarkets 
schlumberger made two further acquisitions during to bolster its real time reservoir management suite of services 
in january  schlumberger acquired norwegian based inside reality as  providing new d virtual reality systems that create a unique and powerful environment for interactive well planning and real time geosteering analysis 
schlumberger also acquired the software and services business of technoguide as  a leader in the reservoir modeling domain 
north america revenue of billion decreased versus a steep revenue decline at the outset of the year reflected a continued lackluster drilling environment and unseasonably mild weather conditions 
throughout the remainder of the year activity levels remained depressed resulting in essentially flat revenue for other factors contributing to reduced revenue included lower non rig related activity resulting in lower wireline  well services  and well completions productivity revenue  the effects of the tropical storms in the third quarter of and a slow pick up in canadian activity post spring break up in pretax operating income of million decreased from million in due to pricing pressures across all services  particularly in well services and well completions productivity 
latin america revenue of billion decreased versus ongoing political and economic uncertainty in the region continued to affect business conditions  particularly in venezuela and argentina 
this particularly impacted results in the first half of the year 
in sharp contrast  the second half of saw solid growth partly as a result of higher demand for drilling measurements and well completions technologies connected to contracts in the burgos basin 
pretax operating income of million declined as a result of decreased activity in venezuela and argentina 
europe cis west africa revenue of billion increased versus strong revenue growth was recorded in the first three quarters of reflecting increased activity levels and market share gains particularly in the caspian and russia geomarkets in respect to artificial lift and drilling technologies 
the well completions productivity and drilling measurements technologies recorded the strongest growth 
this growth was partially mitigated by a steep revenue drop in the fourth quarter of due to exceptionally severe winter weather conditions in the north sea and russia that affected all services 
in addition  operator budget cuts in the nigeria geomarket and refocused investment decisions in the uk contributed to lower fourth quarter revenue 
pretax operating income was million compared to million in  with the very slight decrease due to softening in pricing towards the end of the year and restructuring in the region to reduce support infrastructure to match slowing activity levels 
middle east asia revenue of billion increased versus after a decline at the beginning of resulting from exceptional artificial lift sales at the end of  the asian market showed signs of recovery highlighted by strong revenue growth in the second quarter 
over the year  the india and malaysia brunei philippines geomarkets recorded the strongest growth due to increased activity in these countries 
in addition  the wireline and well services technologies posted the highest growth 
this was partly offset by a slowdown in activity in the second half of due to a number of major projects nearing completion and lower equipment sales 
pretax operating income of million was up versus westerngeco results the revenue increase of to billion in from billion in was mainly attributable to the successful expansion of q technology together with strong multiclient sales 
q revenue grew from million in to million in  with a similar growth rate expected in multiclient sales increased  to million  mainly in the gulf of mexico driven by the renewed interest in the library resulting from a higher oil price environment and an increasing number of blocks in the gulf of mexico coming up for renewal 
approximately of the multiclient surveys sold in had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs and only of the surveys sold were impaired in and land activity decreased reflecting the completion of some projects in malaysia and the middle east  and the shutdown of several crews active in the previous year in alaska  mexico and west africa 
marine activity declined mainly as a result of the decision to reduce the number of vessels in the westerngeco fleet coupled with adverse weather in latin america  lower activity in the caspian and a high number of vessel transits at the end of the year 
marine activity in the first half of is expected to recover with higher vessel utilization and improved pricing 
data processing increased reflecting higher acquisition volumes  higher levels of q processing  and robust third party work coupled with improved operational efficiencies 
pretax operating income reached million in compared to a loss of million in due to lower amortization cost following the impairments of the multiclient library in and coupled with savings related to restructuring measures taken in  accelerating demand for reservoir focused q marine activity together with strong multiclient sales 
data processing also contributed to this improvement due to better operating efficiency 
the westerngeco backlog at the end of the year reached million  increasing over  of which are committed over the next year 
driven by q marine vessel utilization  westerngeco decided to convert the western regent vessel to q technology 
the vessel is scheduled for deployment in the first half of results revenue in was billion versus billion in  a decrease which was primarily due to lower land crew activity following the exiting of the north american land market combined with the completion of some contracts in the middle east 
the decrease in revenue was also due to declines in multiclient sales principally in north south america  partially offset by increased marine activity in europe  caspian and the middle east 
q marine continued to gain customer acceptance 
the end of saw a return to traditional seasonal multiclient revenue levels partially helped by the signing of a long term business agreement with a major energy company that included the licensing of part of the westerngeco data library  as well as joint r d and training on new technology for seismic data processing 
q marine continued to command significant pricing premiums as a result of the added value obtained from the delivered product  but pricing across other business segments was flat to down for conventional marine  land and data processing activity due to continued overcapacity in the industry 
q marine penetration continued strong  reflected by the doubling of q revenue year on year 
pretax operating loss was million versus a profit of million in excluding multiclient impairment and other charges in both years described on page mainly due to significantly higher multiclient amortization charges as a result of lower estimated future revenues 
the lower multiclient sales were primarily due to an overall lessening in interest in the gulf of mexico from the major oil companies coupled with an average price reduction of approximately during the year 
the westerngeco backlog at the end of the year reached million 
results westerngeco revenue of billion decreased compared to  primarily due to decreased activity in north america and europe cis w 
africa  which were partially offset by increases in latin america and the middle east asia 
the seismic downturn continued throughout resulting in significantly lower activity levels  a reduction in multiclient sales  and extreme pricing pressures on all services due to large overcapacity in the seismic industry 
significant workforce reductions were made in the fourth quarter of as a result of the decision to stop land acquisition activities in the us lower states and canada 
pretax operating income of million fell in  primarily due to significantly lower multiclient sales and decreased activities in north america coupled with land seismic contract losses in mexico and marine seismic contract losses in india  both of which were related to production delays 
research engineering expenditures by business segment were as follows stated in millions oilfield services westerngeco other interest expense interest expense in of million included a pretax charge of million and a pretax credit of million related to us interest rate swaps see charges continuing operations 
excluding these items  interest expense decreased million in due to a billion decrease in average debt balances and a decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from to 
the decrease in of million  to million  was due to a decrease in average debt balances of million and a decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from to 
the decrease in of million  to million  was due to a decrease in the weighted average borrowing rates from to  which more than offset a billion increase in average debt balances 
interest income interest income of million in was million higher than the average return on investment in was  a reduction of compared to  due to lower interest rates 
the average investment balance in was billion  an increase of million over due to cash flow from operations and business divestiture proceeds 
the interest income of million was million lower than the average return on investment in decreased by to compared to due to lower interest rates 
the average investment balance in was billion an increase of million over due mainly to cash flow generated by operations and the sale of hanover note

as a percentage of revenue  marketing  research and engineering and general and administrative expenses are as follows marketing research and engineering general and administrative the reported effective tax rate including charges was in  in and in the charges and credits described in detail on pages to increased the effective tax rate by in  in and in the decrease in the reported effective tax rate between and was primarily due to lower non tax effective charges  including charges related to the extinguishment of european debt in  and the country mix of earnings in westerngeco 
the rate for was higher than mainly due to the non tax effective charges related to the extinguishment of european debt in hanover compressor company in august  schlumberger sold its oilfield services worldwide gas compression activity to hanover compressor company 
the proceeds included million shares of hanover compressor common stock  with a value at closing of million  which was restricted from sale until august   and a million long term subordinated note maturing december  schlumberger s investment in hanover compressor is classified as an available for sale security and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
in the fourth quarter of  schlumberger sold the subordinated note for million and realized a pretax gain of million 
at december  the carrying value of schlumberger s investment in hanover compressor common stock exceeded the market value 
as the decline in the market value of the stock was deemed to be other than temporary  schlumberger wrote down the cost basis of its investment to the fair market value of million at december  and recorded a pretax and after tax charge of million in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
at december  the market value of schlumberger s investment in hanover compressor was million

the following table summarizes the results of these discontinued operations stated in millions revenues income loss before taxes tax expense gains losses on disposal  net of tax income loss from discontinued operations schlumbergersema goodwill and other charges discontinued operations on december   schlumberger announced that the board of directors had approved an updated strategy for its schlumbergersema business segment 
the new strategic plan outlook  current business values and the reorganization of schlumbergersema constituted significant events that required an impairment analysis to be performed in accordance with sfas no 
schlumbergersema was valued on a stand alone basis  each reporting unit within schlumbergersema was valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on a long term forecast prepared by schlumbergersema management with the assistance of a third party valuation expert 
the implied multiples yielded by the discounted cash flow analysis were compared to observed trading multiples of comparable companies and recent transactions in the it services industry to assess the fair value of the reporting units 
the fair value was below the book value 
as a result  a billion pretax and after tax goodwill impairment charge was recorded 
this impairment reflected the difficulties of the telecommunications industry and the severely depressed market values of the it companies serving schlumbergersema s sector at the time of the charge 
certain intangible assets were also identified and written down as part of this process  resulting in a million pretax charge million after tax 
additional charges recorded included million million after tax of severance  facility and other costs in an effort to reduce costs at schlumbergersema and a million valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset in europe 
the following is a summary of the above charges included in loss from discontinued operations stated in millions pretax tax min int net charges credits goodwill impairment intangibles impairment schlumbergersema severance and other valuation allowance critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a summary of all of schlumberger s significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
multiclient seismic data the westerngeco segment capitalizes the cost associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data 
such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
however  under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight lined amortized value 
the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
adjustments to the value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues  which involves significant judgment on the part of schlumberger  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys 
significant adverse changes in schlumberger s estimated future revenues could result in impairment charges in a future period 
for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library  future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys us and non us 
the us and non us pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 
schlumberger recorded impairment charges relating to the multiclient library of million in and million in the carrying value of the library at december  and was million and million  respectively 
following the impairment charge  schlumberger will generally not commence a multiclient project unless the project is significantly pre funded by one or more customers 
the reduction in the carrying value of the library from to is primarily attributable to a cautious approach to new investment combined with the significant pre funding requirement 
allowance for doubtful accounts schlumberger maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of schlumberger s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves schlumberger writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step tests for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas schlumberger s reporting units are the four geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment and the westerngeco segment 
schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and or applying various market multiples 
from time to time a third party valuation expert may be utilized to assist in the determination of fair value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
schlumberger s estimates of the fair value of each of its previously mentioned reporting units was significantly in excess of their carrying value during  and long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s recorded value  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management 
in order to estimate the fair value of a long lived asset  schlumberger may engage a third part to assist with the valuation 
if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value  schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 
investments schlumberger and smith international inc operate a drilling fluids joint venture of which schlumberger owns a interest and records income using the equity method of accounting 
schlumberger s investment at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the carrying value of this joint venture is evaluated for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates that a decline in the fair value of this investment that is other than temporary has occurred 
fair value is generally estimated by comparing the significance of this joint venture to smith international inc  a publicly traded company  and then referencing the market capitalization of smith international inc to date  schlumberger has not recorded any impairment charges relating to this investment as this analysis has indicated that the fair value of this investment is significantly in excess of its carrying value 
losses on contracts losses on contracts are provided for when such losses become known and can be reasonably estimated 
historically  losses on contracts that have had a material impact on schlumberger s consolidated results of operations have been rare 
income taxes schlumberger s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or  potentially  through the courts 
tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits 
estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances 
however  due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates 
in such an event  schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the year in which such resolution occurs 
schlumberger had net deferred tax assets of million at december   which excluded million relating to net operating losses in certain countries for which there is a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for valuation allowances  schlumberger considers the probable likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
contingencies the consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for the estimated future costs associated with certain environmental remediation activities related to the past use or disposal of hazardous material where it is probable that schlumberger has incurred a liability and such amount can be reasonably estimated 
substantially all such costs relate to divested operations and to facilities or locations that are no longer in operation 
due to a number of uncertainties  including uncertainty of timing  the scope of remediation  future technology  regulatory changes  the risk of personal injury  natural resource or property damage claims and other factors  it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated 
however  in the opinion of management  such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity  financial position or future results of operations 
the consolidated balance sheet included accruals for estimated future expenditures associated with business divestitures which have been completed 
it is possible that the ultimate expenditures may differ from the amounts recorded 
in the opinion of management  such differences are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity  financial position or future results of operations 
in december  westerngeco and schlumberger received grand jury subpoenas from the us attorney s office in the southern district of texas seeking documents relating to possible fraud in obtaining visas for non us citizens working as crewmembers on vessels operating in the gulf of mexico 
we are in the process of responding to the investigation  including providing information sought by the subpoenas 
schlumberger is currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter and the related impact it might have on schlumberger s financial position and results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates 
these assumptions are important elements of expense and or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 
the discount rate we use reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations 
the discount rate utilized to determine the projected benefit obligation for schlumberger s us pension plan was reduced from at december  to at december  the discount rate utilized to determine the projected benefit obligation for schlumberger s uk pension was reduced from at december  to at december  these changes were made to reflect market interest rate conditions 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a change of basis points in the discount rate assumption would have an estimated million impact on annual pension expense 
the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation  are expected to be paid 
schlumberger s expected rate of return has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio  with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class 
the expected rate of return on plan assets was in both and a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 
a change of basis points in the expected rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately million 
schlumberger s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in was graded to over the next five years and thereafter 
if the assumed medical cost trend rate was increased by one percentage point  health care cost in would have increased by million  and the accumulated postretirement obligation would have increased by million on december  if the assumed medical cost trend rate was decreased by one percentage point  health care cost in would have decreased by million  and the accumulated postretirement obligation would have decreased by million on december  cash flow in  cash provided by operations was billion as net income plus depreciation amortization and net charges  including the extinguishment of us and european debt  were only partially offset by increases in customer receivables and inventories  due to higher operating revenues 
cash provided by investing activities was billion as the proceeds from non oilfield business divestitures billion and the proceeds from the sale schlumberger s investment of million shares in of atos origin billion was partially offset by investments in fixed assets billion and multiclient seismic data million 
cash used in financing activities was billion with the proceeds from employee stock plans million offset by the payment of dividends to shareholders million  the costs related to the extinguishment of certain us and european debt million  the repurchase of million shares of schlumberger stock million and an overall reduction in debt of billion 
net debt is gross debt less cash  short term investments and fixed income investments held to maturity 
management believes that net debt provides useful information regarding the level of schlumberger s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt  and that the level of net debt provides useful information as to the results of schlumberger s deleveraging efforts

new accounting standard in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas r share based payment 
the standard amends sfas accounting for stock based compensation and concludes that services received from employees in exchange for stock based compensation results in a cost to the employer that must be recognized in the financial statements 
the cost of such awards should be measured at fair value at the date of grant 
sfas r provides public companies with a choice of transition methods to implement the standard 
schlumberger anticipates applying the modified prospective method whereby companies would recognize compensation cost for the unamortized portion of vested awards outstanding at the effective date of sfas r july  for schlumberger and granted after january  such cost will be recognized in schlumberger s financial statements over the remaining vesting period 
as described in note  in schlumberger adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas nos 
and on a prospective basis for grants after january  therefore  effective july   schlumberger will have to apply the provisions of sfas r to the unvested portion of awards granted during the period of january  to december  the adoption of this standard is currently expected to reduce schlumberger s diluted earnings per share by approximately

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk schlumberger is subject to market risk primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity prices 
as a multinational company  schlumberger conducts its business in over countries 
schlumberger s functional currency is primarily the us dollar  which is consistent with the oil and gas industry 
approximately of schlumberger s operating revenue in was denominated in us dollars 
however  outside the us  a significant portion of schlumberger s expenses are incurred in foreign currencies 
therefore  when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business  the us dollar reported expenses will decrease 
a change in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in would have changed operating revenue by approximately 
if the average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had increased by  schlumberger s income from continuing operations would have increased by 
conversely  a weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by schlumberger maintains a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates 
forward currency contracts provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on assets liabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 
option contracts are usually entered into as a hedge against currency variations on firm commitments generally involving the construction of long lived assets 
on december   contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of billion in various foreign currencies 
these contracts mature on various dates in schlumberger does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate derivatives for speculative purposes 
schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt
