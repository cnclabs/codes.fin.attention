ratings ratings with respect to claims paying ability and financial strength have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in the company and its ability to market its annuity and life insurance products 
rating agencies continually review the financial performance and condition of insurers  including the company 
any lowering of the company s ratings could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to market its products and could increase the rate of surrender of the company s products 
both of these consequences could  depending upon the extent thereof  have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and  under certain circumstances  net income 
nlic and its insurance company subsidiary and nlica and its main insurance company subsidiary each have financial strength ratings of a superior from am best company  inc am best 
both nlic and nlica s claims paying ability financial strength are rated aa excellent by moody s investors service  inc moody s and aa very strong by standard poor s ratings services s p 
the foregoing ratings reflect each rating agency s opinion of nlic and nlica s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet their obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors 
such factors are of concern to policyholders  agents and intermediaries 
furthermore  rating agencies utilize proprietary capital adequacy models to establish ratings for the company and certain subsidiaries 
the company is at risk to changes in these models and the impact that changes in the underlying business in which it is engaged can have on such models 
to mitigate this risk  the company maintains regular communications with the rating agencies  performs evaluations using such capital adequacy models  and considers such models in the design of its products and transactions to minimize the adverse impact of this risk 
the company s financial strength is also reflected in the ratings of its senior notes  subordinated debentures  capital and preferred securities issued by subsidiary trusts and commercial paper 
the senior notes are rated a by am best  a by moody s and a by s p 
the subordinated debentures are rated bbb by am best  baa by moody s and bbb by s p

competition in the company s lines of business primarily is based on price  product features  commission structure  perceived financial strength  claims paying ratings  customer and producer service  and name recognition 
on november   the gramm leach bliley act the act was signed 
the act modernizes the regulatory framework for financial services in the u 
s  allowing banks  securities firms and insurance 
table of contents companies to affiliate more directly than previously permitted 
while the act facilitates these affiliations  the company does not believe that it has experienced a competitive disadvantage from any competitors that have acquired  or been acquired by  a banking entity under authority of the act 
nevertheless  it is not possible to anticipate whether such affiliations might occur in a manner that negatively impacts the company s competitive position in the future 
regulation general regulation at state level as an insurance holding company  the company is subject to regulation by the states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and or transact business 
most states have enacted legislation that requires each insurance holding company and each insurance company in an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of the insurance company s state of domicile and annually furnish financial and other information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within such system 
in many cases  under such laws  a state insurance authority must approve in advance the direct or indirect acquisition of or more of the voting securities of an insurance company domiciled in its state 
the company is subject to the insurance holding company laws in the state of ohio 
under such laws  all transactions within an insurance holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable  and each insurer s policyholder surplus following any such transaction must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its needs 
the state of ohio insurance holding company laws also require prior notice or regulatory approval of the change of control of an insurer or its holding company and of material intercorporate transfers of assets within the holding company structure 
in addition  the laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers to approve  among other things  policy forms  grant and revoke licenses to transact business  regulate trade practices  license agents  require statutory financial statements  limit the amount of dividends and other payments that may be paid by insurance companies without prior approval  and impose restrictions on the type and amount of investments permitted 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect policyholders rather than shareholders 
the company cannot predict the effect that any proposed or future legislation may have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
insurance companies are required to file detailed annual and quarterly statutory financial statements with state insurance regulators in each of the states in which they do business  and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time

in recent years  a number of life and annuity insurers have been the subject of regulatory proceedings and litigation relating to alleged improper life insurance pricing and sales practices 
some of these insurers have 
table of contents incurred or paid substantial amounts in connection with the resolution of such matters 
in addition  state insurance regulatory authorities regularly make inquiries  hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to insurers compliance with applicable insurance laws and regulations 
nlic and nlaic are currently undergoing regulatory market conduct examinations in five states 
the company s insurance subsidiaries continuously monitor sales  marketing and advertising practices and related activities of their agents and personnel and provide continuing education and training in an effort to ensure compliance with applicable insurance laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance that any non compliance with such applicable laws and regulations would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the naic adopted model legislation in december  implementing new disclosure requirements with respect to compensation of insurance producers 
the model legislation requires that insurance producers obtain the consent of the insured and disclose to the insured  where such producers receive any compensation from the insured  the amount of compensation from the insurer 
in those cases where the contingent commission is not known  producers would be required to provide a reasonable estimate of the amount and method for calculating such compensation 
producers who represent companies and do not receive compensation from the insured would have a duty to disclose that relationship in certain circumstances 
the naic directed its task force on broker activities to give further consideration to the development of additional requirements for the model legislation  such as recognition of a fiduciary responsibility of producers  disclosure of all quotes received by a broker  and disclosures relating to agent owned reinsurance arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the model legislation will be adopted by any particular states  nor can the company be certain how such legislation or regulation  if adopted  would impact the company s results of operations or financial position

the state of ohio insurance laws require ohio domiciled life insurance companies to seek prior regulatory approval to pay a dividend or distribution of cash or other property if the fair market value thereof  together with that of other dividends or distributions made in the preceding months  exceeds the greater of i of statutory basis policyholders surplus as of the prior december or ii the statutory basis net income of the insurer for the month period ending as of the prior december during the year ended december   nlic paid dividends of million to nfs

additionally  following any dividend  an insurer s policyholder surplus must be reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs 
the payment of dividends by nlic may also be subject to restrictions set forth in the insurance laws of the state of new york that limit the amount of statutory profits on nlic s participating policies measured before dividends to policyholders that can inure to the benefit of the company and its stockholders 
the company currently does not expect such regulatory requirements to impair its ability to pay operating expenses and dividends in the future 
the ability of nlica to pay dividends is subject to regulation under pennsylvania insurance law 
under pennsylvania insurance laws  unless the pid either approves or fails to disapprove payment within days after being notified  nlica may not pay any cash dividends or other non stock distributions to nfs during any month period if the total payments exceed the greater of i of statutory basis policyholders surplus as of the prior december  or ii the statutory basis net income of the insurer for the prior year

risk based capital requirements in order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency  the naic has adopted a model law to implement risk based capital rbc requirements for life insurance companies 
the requirements are designed to monitor capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholders 
the model law measures four major areas of risk facing life insurers i the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuation  ii the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience  iii the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates  and iv business risks 
insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the rbc model formula will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
based on the formula adopted by the naic  all of the company s insurance subsidiaries adjusted capital as of december  exceeded  by a substantial amount  the levels at which the company would be required to take corrective action 
assessments against and refunds to insurers insurance guaranty association laws exist in all states  the district of columbia and the commonwealth of puerto rico

the amount and timing of any future assessment on or refund to the company s insurance subsidiaries under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond the control of the company and its insurance subsidiaries

erisa requires that fiduciaries perform their duties solely in the interest of erisa plan participants and beneficiaries  and with the care  skill  prudence and diligence that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims 
the court imposed erisa fiduciary obligations to the extent that the insurer s general account is not reserved to pay benefits under guaranteed benefit policies ie benefits whose value would not fluctuate in accordance with the insurer s investment experience 
the us secretary of labor issued final regulations on january   providing guidance for the purpose of determining  in cases where an insurer issues one or more policies backed by the insurer s general account to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan  which assets of the insurer constitute plan assets for purposes of erisa and the irc

as a result  demand for certain of nlic s products that offer income tax deferral may be negatively impacted 
the us congress has  from time to time  considered possible legislation that would eliminate many of the tax benefits currently afforded to annuity products 
in fact  the bush administration has made proposals to establish several new types of tax advantaged retirement and life savings accounts  each of which  if enacted as proposed  could materially reduce the tax advantages of purchasing variable annuity and cash value life insurance products as compared to other investment vehicles

nfs is the holding company for nationwide life insurance company nlic and other companies that comprise the domestic life insurance and retirement savings operations of the nationwide group of companies nationwide  including nationwide financial network nfn  which refers to nationwide life insurance company of america nlica and subsidiaries  including the affiliated distribution network  and which was formerly referred to as nationwide provident 
the company is a leading provider of long term savings and retirement products in the united states of america 
the company develops and sells a diverse range of products including individual annuities  private and public group retirement plans  other investment products sold to institutions  life insurance and advisory services 
as a result of its initial public offering in march and subsequent stock related transactions since that date  including the issuance of million shares in connection with the acquisition of nfn  of the economic interest in nfs is publicly owned  with the remainder owned by nationwide corporation nationwide corp  which is a majority owned subsidiary of nationwide mutual insurance company nmic 
critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the audited consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining dac for investment products and universal life insurance products  voba  impairment losses on investments  valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate  federal income taxes  goodwill  and pension and other postretirement employee benefits 
note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report provides a summary of significant accounting policies 
note to the consolidated financial statements included in f pages of this report provides a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
deferred policy acquisition costs for investment products and universal life insurance products the company has deferred the costs of acquiring investment products and universal life insurance products business  principally commissions  certain expenses of the policy issue and underwriting department  and certain variable sales expenses that relate to and vary with the production of new and renewal business 
investment products consist primarily of individual and group variable and fixed deferred annuities 
universal life insurance products include universal life insurance  variable universal life insurance  corporate owned life insurance coli and other interest sensitive life insurance policies 
dac is subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and loss recognition testing at the end of each reporting period 
for investment products principally individual and group annuities and universal life insurance products  dac is being amortized with interest over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from projected interest margins  asset fees  cost of insurance  policy administration and surrender charges  less policy benefits and policy maintenance expenses 
the dac asset related to investment products and universal life insurance products is adjusted to reflect the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities available for sale  as described in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report 

table of contents the most significant assumptions that are involved in the estimation of future gross profits include future net separate account performance  surrender lapse rates  interest margins and mortality 
the company s long term assumption for net separate account performance is currently growth per year 
if actual net separate account performance varies from the assumption  the company assumes different performance levels over the next three years such that the mean return equals the long term assumption 
this process is referred to as a reversion to the mean 
the assumed net separate account return assumptions used in the dac models are intended to reflect what is anticipated 
however  based on historical returns of the standard poor s s p index  the company s policy regarding the reversion to the mean process does not permit such returns to be negative or in excess of during the three year reversion period 
changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the amount of dac reported for investment products and universal life insurance products and their related amortization patterns 
in the event actual experience differs from assumptions or assumptions are revised  the company is required to record an increase or decrease in dac amortization expense dac unlocking  which could be significant 
in general  increases in the estimated general and separate account returns result in increased expected future profitability and may lower the rate of dac amortization  while increases in lapse surrender and mortality assumptions reduce the expected future profitability of the underlying business and may increase the rate of dac amortization 
the company evaluates the appropriateness of the individual variable annuity dac balance within pre set parameters 
these parameters are designed to appropriately reflect the company s long term expectations with respect to individual variable annuity contracts while also evaluating the potential impact of short term experience on the company s recorded individual variable annuity dac balance 
if the recorded balance of individual variable annuity dac falls outside of these parameters for a prescribed period of time  or if the recorded balance falls outside of these parameters and the company determines it is not reasonably possible to get back within this period of time  assumptions are required to be unlocked and dac is recalculated using revised best estimate assumptions 
otherwise  dac is not unlocked to reflect updated assumptions 
if dac assumptions were unlocked and revised  the company would continue to use the reversion to the mean process 
for other investment products and universal life insurance products  dac is adjusted each quarter to reflect revised best estimate assumptions  including the use of a reversion to the mean methodology over the next three years as it relates to net separate account performance 
any resulting dac unlocking adjustments are reflected currently in the consolidated statements of income 
value of business acquired as a result of the acquisition of nfn in and the application of purchase accounting  the company reports an intangible asset representing the estimated fair value of the business in force and the portion of the purchase price that was allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash flows from the life insurance and annuity contracts existing as of the closing date of the nfn acquisition 
the value assigned to voba in the purchase accounting for nfn was supported by an independent valuation study that was commissioned by the company and executed by a team of qualified valuation experts  including actuarial consultants 
the expected future cash flows used in determining such value were based on actuarially determined projections by major line of business of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  changes in reserves  operating expenses  investment income and other factors 
these projections considered all known or expected factors at the valuation date based on the judgment of management 
the actual experience on purchased business  to some extent  has and may continue to vary from projections due to differences in renewal premiums  investment spreads  investment gains and losses  mortality and morbidity costs  or other factors 
amortization of voba occurs with interest over the anticipated lives of the major lines of business to which it relates initially ranging from to years in relation to estimated gross profits  gross margins or premiums  as appropriate 
if estimated gross profits  gross margins or premiums differ from expectations  the amortization of voba is adjusted on a retrospective or prospective basis  as appropriate 
the voba asset 
table of contents related to investment products and universal life insurance products is adjusted annually for the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale had such gains and losses been realized and allocated to the product lines  as described in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report 
the recoverability of voba is evaluated annually 
if the evaluation indicates that the existing insurance liabilities  together with the present value of future net cash flows from the blocks of business acquired  is insufficient to recover voba  the difference  if any  is charged to expense as accelerated amortization of voba 
for those products amortized in relation to estimated gross profits  the most significant assumptions involved in the estimation of future gross profits include future net separate account performance  surrender lapse rates  interest margins and mortality 
the company s long term assumption for net separate account performance is currently 
if actual net separate account performance varies from the assumption  the company assumes different performance levels over the next three years such that the mean return equals the long term assumption 
the assumed net separate account return assumptions used in the voba models are intended to reflect what is anticipated 
however  based on historical returns of the s p index  the company s policy regarding the reversion to the mean process does not permit such returns to be negative or in excess of during the three year reversion period 
changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the amount of voba reported for all products and their related amortization patterns 
in the event actual experience differs from assumptions or assumptions are revised  the company is required to record an increase or decrease in voba amortization expense voba unlocking  which could be significant 
in general  increases in the estimated general and separate account returns result in increased expected future profitability and may lower the rate of voba amortization  while increases in lapse surrender and mortality assumptions reduce the expected future profitability of the underlying business and may increase the rate of voba amortization 
impairment losses on investments management regularly reviews each investment in its fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
under the company s accounting policy for equity securities and debt securities that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in a way that may limit the company s ability to fully recover cost  an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary unless the company has both the ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period until the security s forecasted recovery and evidence exists indicating that recovery will occur in a reasonable period of time 
also  for such debt securities the company estimates cash flows over the life of purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
if the company estimates that the fair value of its beneficial interests is not greater than or equal to its carrying value based on current information and events  and if there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then the company recognizes an other than temporary impairment and writes down the purchased beneficial interest to fair value 
for other debt and equity securities  an other than temporary impairment charge is taken when the company does not have the ability and intent to hold the security until the forecasted recovery or if it is no longer probable that the company will recover all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security 
many criteria are considered during this process including  but not limited to  the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  of the security  the amount and length of time a security s fair value has been below amortized cost or cost  specific credit issues and financial prospects related to the issuer  the company s intent to hold or dispose of the security  and current economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction to the cost basis of the underlying investment 

table of contents impairment losses are recorded on investments in long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
significant changes in the factors the company considers when evaluating investments for impairment losses  including significant deterioration in the credit worthiness of individual issuers  could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate the company provides valuation allowances for impairments of mortgage loans on real estate based on a review by portfolio managers 
mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when the company determines that a loan is impaired  a provision for loss is established equal to the difference between the carrying value and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
in addition to the valuation allowance on specific loans  the company maintains an unallocated allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date  but not yet specifically identified by loan 
changes in the valuation allowance are recorded in net realized gains and losses on investments  hedging instruments and hedged items 
loans in foreclosure are placed on non accrual status 
interest received on non accrual status mortgage loans on real estate is included in net investment income in the period received 
the valuation allowance account for mortgage loans on real estate is maintained at a level believed adequate by the company and reflects the company s best estimate of probable credit losses  including losses incurred at the balance sheet date but not yet identified by specific loan 
the company s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses is based on past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
significant changes in the factors the company considers in determining the valuation allowance for mortgage loans on real estate could result in a significant change in the valuation allowance reported in the consolidated financial statements 
federal income taxes the company provides for federal income taxes based on amounts the company believes it ultimately will owe 
inherent in the provision for federal income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items and the realization of certain tax credits 
in the event the ultimate deductibility of certain items or the realization of certain tax credits differs from estimates  the company may be required to significantly change the provision for federal income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
any such change could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated statements of income 
goodwill in connection with acquisitions of operating entities  the company recognizes the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter 
goodwill of a reporting unit also is tested for impairment on an interim basis in addition to the annual evaluation if an event occurs or circumstances change which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment requires several judgments and assumptions to be made to determine the fair value of the reporting units  including the method used to determine fair value  discount 
table of contents rates  expected levels of cash flows  revenues and earnings  and the selection of comparable companies used to develop market based assumptions 
management believes all judgments and assumptions made in connection with goodwill impairment testing are reasonable based on the underlying facts and circumstances evaluated 
however  variances in actual results from expectations or changes in expectations for future cash flows  revenues and or earnings could result in significant future goodwill impairment charges 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb assumptions are revised annually in conjunction with preparation of the company s annual report on form k 
the pension expense for substantially all of the company s employees and certain agents totaled million  an increase of million over pension expense of million 
the increase primarily was due to decreasing interest rates at the plan level  reflected in a lower discount rate 
for the company s primary pension plan  the discount rate used to value cash flows was lowered to to determine pension expense from used in  and the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was lowered to for from for the and opeb expense for substantially all of the company s employees and certain agents totaled million and million  respectively 
the discount rate used to value cash flows was lowered to to determine opeb expense from used in  and the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was lowered to for from for the company employs a prospective building block approach in establishing the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
this process is integrated with the determination of other economic assumptions such as salary scale 
for a given measurement date  the discount rate is set by reference to the yield on high quality corporate bonds to approximate the rate at which plan benefits could effectively be settled 
for pension benefits  a downward adjustment in the discount rate is included for plan administration and other expenses likely to be charged by an insurer 
since the opeb liability includes both claims and administration expenses  a similar downward adjustment is not appropriate for the opeb discount rate 
the historical real rate of return for the reference bonds is subtracted from the yield on these bonds to generate an assumed inflation rate 
the expected real rates of return on various asset sub classes are developed based on historic risk premiums for those sub classes 
the expected real rates of return  reduced for investment expenses  are applied to the target allocation of each asset sub class to produce an expected real rate of return for the target portfolio 
this expected real rate of return varies by plan and changes when the plan s target investment portfolio changes 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is the assumed inflation rate plus the expected real rate of return 
this process effectively sets the expected return for the plan s portfolio at the yield for the reference bond portfolio  adjusted for expected risk premiums of the target asset portfolio 
given the prospective nature of this calculation  short term fluctuations in the market do not impact the expected risk premiums 
however  as the yield for the reference bonds fluctuates  the assumed inflation rate and the expected long term rate are adjusted in tandem 
the following illustrates the impact of changes in individual assumptions without changing any other assumption on expenses in a basis point increase in the pension discount rate would have decreased pension expense by approximately  and a basis point increase in the pension long term expected rate of return would have decreased pension expense by approximately  and a basis point increase in the opeb discount rate would have decreased opeb expense by approximately  and a basis point increase in the opeb long term expected rate of return would have decreased opeb expense by approximately 

table of contents results of operations revenues total revenues for increased to billion compared to billion in the growth in primarily was driven by higher policy charges  other income and net investment income  partially offset by a decline in life insurance premiums 
asset based policy charges increased due to improved equity market returns 
the increase in other income was primarily driven by increased sales of retirement plans and an increase in securitizations and structured products activity 
net investment income increased due primarily to additional prepayment income on mortgage loans and bond call premiums 
the growth in revenues in from billion in was driven by the addition of nfn  which added million in revenues in policy charges include asset fees  which are earned primarily from separate account values generated from the sale of individual and group variable annuities and investment life insurance products  cost of insurance charges earned on universal life insurance products  administrative fees  which include fees charged per contract on a variety of the company s products and premium loads on universal life insurance products  and surrender fees  which are charged as a percentage of premiums withdrawn or account values during a specified period for annuity and certain life insurance contracts 
the following table summarizes policy charges for the years ended december in millions asset fees cost of insurance charges administrative fees surrender fees total policy charges asset fees totaled million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increases in and were due to changes in the market value of the investment options underlying the account values  which have followed the general upward trends of the equity markets 
asset fees were flat in compared to  reflecting slight fluctuations in average separate account values 
net investment income includes the investment income earned on investments supporting fixed annuities  the medium term note mtn program  certain life insurance products and invested assets not allocated to product segments  net of related investment expenses 
net investment income totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in the increase in primarily was due to higher prepayment income on mortgage loans and higher bond call premium income 
the increase in was primarily due to increased invested assets supporting growth in individual fixed annuities  allocations to the fixed option of variable annuities and the medium term note program  partially offset by lower yields due to declining market interest rates 
the company makes decisions concerning the sale of invested assets based on a variety of market  business  tax and other factors 
all realized gains and losses generated by these sales  charges related to other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities and other investments  and changes in valuation allowances on mortgage loans on real estate are reported in realized gains and losses on investments  hedging instruments and hedged items

other income includes management fees  commissions and other income earned by subsidiaries of the company that provide administration  marketing and distribution services 
other income in increased to million from million and million in and  respectively 
the increases in and reflect an increase in the number of private sector retirement plans sold through nationwide trust company  fsb ntc and increased securitizations and structured products activity 
benefits and expenses interest credited to policyholder account values totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in  and principally relates to fixed annuities  both individual and institutional  funding agreements backing the company s mtn program and certain life insurance products 
the decrease in interest credited reflects lower crediting rates in the individual investments segment and the private sector in the retirement plans segment in response to lower market interest rates  partially offset by increases in account values 
average crediting rates for the individual investments segment were in  compared to a year ago and in average crediting rates for the retirement plans segment were in  compared to a year ago and in the increase in market interest rates in second quarter does not appear immediately in interest credited due to the timing of rate reset dates  which are typically annual or quarterly 
the increase in interest credited in reflects an increase in account values for individual and institutional fixed annuities as a result of strong fixed annuity production during the first three quarters of  and increased allocations of variable annuity deposits to the guaranteed fixed option through may 
the increase was partially offset by lower crediting rates in the individual investments and retirement plans segments on products where crediting rates have not already reached guaranteed floors 
other benefits and claims include policyholder benefits in excess of policyholder account values for universal life and individual deferred annuities and net claims and provisions for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities 
other benefits and claims decreased from million in to million in the decline primarily was due to a decrease in gmdb benefits driven by improved equity market levels and reduced life insurance benefits as a result of favorable mortality 
the significant increase in other benefits and claims for compared to reflect additional life insurance benefits related to nfn  growth in life insurance in force  an increase in the provision for future policy benefits for immediate annuities due to growth in new premium in compared to  and an increase in guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb costs due to a higher level of claims 
policyholder dividends on participating policies decreased by to million in compared to million in the same period a year ago 
the decline was due to a reduction in dividend scale as a result of lower interest rates 
policyholder dividends on participating policies increased to million in compared to million in due to the addition of nfn  which had a significant amount of participating life insurance 
amortization of dac increased to million in compared to million in the increase in dac amortization expense primarily was attributable to the individual investments segment due to higher estimated gross profits on the underlying business 
amortization of dac decreased by million in from million in the substantial decrease in dac amortization in reflects an acceleration of dac amortization recorded in the third quarter of as part of the regular quarterly analysis of dac  at the end of the third quarter of  the company determined that using actual experience to date and assumptions consistent with those used in the second quarter of  its individual variable annuity dac balance would be 
table of contents outside a pre set parameter of acceptable results 
the company also determined that it was not reasonably possible that the dac would return to an amount within the acceptable parameter within a prescribed period of time 
accordingly  the company unlocked its dac assumptions for individual variable annuities and reduced the dac asset to the amount calculated using the revised assumptions 
because the company unlocked the net separate account growth rate assumption for individual variable annuities for the three year reversion period  the company unlocked that assumption for all investment products and variable universal life insurance products to be consistent across product lines 
therefore  in  the company recorded an acceleration of dac amortization totaling million  before tax  or million  net of million of tax benefit  which has been reported in the following segments in the amounts indicated  net of tax individual investments million  retirement plans million and individual protection million 
the acceleration of dac amortization was the result of unlocking certain assumptions underlying the calculation of dac for investment products and variable universal life insurance products 
the most significant assumption changes were the resetting of the company s anchor date for reversion to the mean calculations to september   resetting the assumption for annual net separate account growth to percent during the three year reversion period for all investment products and variable life insurance products  and increasing future lapses and costs related to gmdb on individual variable annuity contracts 
these adjustments were primarily driven by the sustained downturn in the equity markets 
excluding accelerated dac amortization of million in  amortization of dac increased million to million in compared to million in  primarily due to the addition of nfn and growth in the individual investments segment 
the increases in interest expense on debt for and were due to the issuance of million of senior notes in february  an increase in the utilization of commercial paper in and  and interest on short term borrowings related to a consolidated variable interest entity during other operating expenses increased to million in compared to million other operating expenses were million in the increases reflect higher advertising and promotion and employee compensation and benefits expenses 
federal income tax expense in and was million and million  respectively  representing an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
federal income tax benefit in was million  representing an effective rate of 
the effective tax rate for increased because permanent items grew at a lower rate than pre tax earnings 
pre tax earnings increased by while the permanent tax deductions increased by 
the increase in the permanent tax deductions was due to the release of the phase iii tax liability due to changes in the tax law enacted in  partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance for a consolidated subsidiary  while the separate account dividends received deduction remained fairly constant 
the tax benefit of million associated with the million of accelerated dac amortization in third quarter was calculated at the us federal corporate income tax rate of  which substantially impacts what would normally be expected to be reported as effective tax rates

cumulative effect of adoption of accounting principle in july  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop 
sop addresses many topics 
the most significant topic affecting the company was the accounting for contracts with gmdb 
sop requires companies to evaluate the significance of a gmdb to determine whether a contract should be accounted for as an investment or insurance contract 
for contracts determined to be insurance contracts  companies are required to establish a reserve to recognize a portion of the assessment revenue that compensates the insurance company for benefits to be provided in future periods 
sop also provides guidance on separate account presentation  interest in separate accounts  gains and losses on the transfer of assets from the general account to a separate account  liability valuation  return based on a contractually referenced pool of assets or index  annuitization options  and sales inducements to contract holders 
the company adopted sop effective january   which resulted in a million charge  net of tax  as the cumulative effect of adoption of this accounting principle

sales or similar measures are commonly used in the insurance industry as a measure of the volume of new and renewal business generated in a period 
sales are not derived from any specific gaap income statement accounts or line items and should not be viewed as a substitute for any financial measure determined in accordance with gaap  including sales as it relates to non insurance companies 
additionally  the company s definition of sales may differ from that used by other companies

in addition  many life insurance and annuity products involve an initial deposit or a series of deposits from customers 
these deposits are accounted for as such on a gaap basis and therefore are not reflected in the gaap income statement 
on a statutory basis  life insurance premiums collected cash basis and deposits received cash basis are aggregated and reported as revenues in the line item statutory premiums and annuity considerations 
sales  as reported by the company  are stated net of internal replacements  which the company believes provides a more meaningful disclosure of production in a given period 
in addition  the company s definition of sales excludes funding agreements issued under the company s mtn program  large case bank owned life insurance boli  large case retirement plan acquisitions  and deposits into nationwide employee and agent benefit plans 
although these products contribute to asset and earnings growth  they do not produce steady production flow that lends itself to meaningful comparisons and  therefore  are excluded from sales

instead of paying a one time amount at the point of sale  a smaller payment is made each year the business remains in force 
in some cases  a combination of both types of compensation is paid 
the second factor was increased expenses primarily related to advertising and promotion as well as employee compensation 
table of contents and benefits

the higher interest rate environment in relative to a year ago has eased the pressure on margins due to the interest rate floors contained in annuity contracts 
the company has taken actions to address low interest rate environments and the resulting impact on interest spread margins 
in the company lowered commission rates for individual fixed annuities  and the company began invoking contractual provisions during second quarter that limited the amount of variable annuity deposits allocated to the guaranteed fixed option 
in addition  the company re filed its products with lower floor guarantees in  and the majority of new business is now written in these lower floor guarantee products

as a result  at december   the company reported as a component of long term debt the junior subordinated debentures payable by nfs to the trusts 
previously  the junior subordinated debentures were eliminated in consolidation

nfs is a holding company whose principal asset is the common stock of nlic 
the principal sources of funds for nfs to pay interest  dividends and operating expenses are existing cash and investments and dividends from nlic and other subsidiaries 
as an insurance holding company  the ability of nfs to meet debt service obligations and pay operating expenses and dividends depends primarily on the receipt of sufficient funds from its primary operating subsidiary  nlic 
the inability of nlic to pay dividends to nfs in an amount sufficient to meet debt service obligations and pay operating expenses and dividends would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the payment of dividends by nlic is subject to restrictions set forth in the insurance laws and regulations of the state of ohio  its domiciliary state 
the state of ohio insurance laws require ohio domiciled life insurance companies to seek prior regulatory approval to pay a dividend or distribution of cash or other property if the fair market value thereof  together with that of other dividends or distributions made in the preceding months  exceeds the greater of i of statutory basis policyholders surplus as of the prior december  or ii the statutory basis net income of the insurer for the month period ending as of the prior december nlic s statutory capital and surplus as of december  was billion  and statutory net income for was million 
as of january   based on statutory financial results as of and for the year ended december   nlic could pay dividends to nfs totaling million without obtaining prior approval 
on march   nlic paid a million dividend to nfs 
the state of ohio insurance laws also require insurers to seek prior regulatory approval for any dividend paid from other than earned surplus 
the payment of dividends by nlic may also be subject to restrictions set forth in the insurance laws of the state of new york that limit the amount of statutory profits on nlic s participating policies measured before dividends to policyholders that can inure to the benefit of nfs and its stockholders 
the ability of nlica to pay dividends to nfs is subject to regulation under pennsylvania insurance law 
under pennsylvania insurance laws  unless the pennsylvania insurance department pid either approves or fails to disapprove payment within days after being notified  nlica may not pay any cash dividends or other non stock distributions to nfs during any month period if the total payments exceed the greater of i of statutory basis policyholders surplus as of the prior december  or ii the statutory basis net income of the insurer for the prior year 
in connection with the acquisition of nlica  the pid ordered that no dividends could 
table of contents be paid out of nlica before october  without prior approval 
the statutory capital and surplus of nlica as of december  was million  while statutory net income for the year ended december  was million 
nlica sought and received permission from the pid to pay million of dividends to nfs during effective october   based on statutory financial results as of and for the year ended december   and based on dividends paid through march   nlica will be able to pay dividends to nfs totaling million without obtaining prior approval 
nfs currently does not expect such regulatory requirements to impair its ability to pay interest  dividends  operating expenses and principal in the future 
also available as a source of funds to the company is a billion revolving credit facility entered into by nfs  nlic and nmic with a group of national financial institutions 
the facility provides for several and not joint liability with respect to any amount drawn by any party 
the facility provides covenants  including  but not limited to  requirements that the company maintain consolidated tangible net worth  as defined  in excess of billion and nlic maintain statutory surplus in excess of billion 
the company had no amounts outstanding under this agreement as of december  nlic also has an million commercial paper program and is required to maintain an available credit facility equal to of any amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program 
therefore  borrowing capacity under the billion revolving credit facility is reduced by of any amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program 
nlic had million in commercial paper outstanding as of december  the company has an available financing capacity of billion under a shelf registration statement dated february  under the shelf registration statement  the company can issue many security instruments including  but not limited to  unsecured senior or subordinated debt securities  preferred stock  class a common stock  stock purchase contracts or stock purchase units 
the company may also  in conjunction with owned trusts  issue trust preferred securities guaranteed by nfs 
in addition  the company has two majority owned subsidiaries that each have available separate annually renewable  day  million line of credit agreements with a single financial institution 
the lines of credit are guaranteed by nfs and are included in consolidation 
one of the agreements was renewed in september  and the majority owned subsidiary had million outstanding on that line of credit as of december  at a weighted average effective interest rate of in the other agreement was established in august  and the majority owned subsidiary had million outstanding on that line of credit as of december  at a weighted average effective interest rate of in see also note to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report 
also  as a result of consolidating certain variable interest entities where the company was identified as the primary beneficiary  the company reported million of short term debt as of december  related to borrowings under a securities lending agreement 
as of december   the company has not provided any guarantees on such borrowings  either directly or indirectly 
nlic has entered into an agreement with its custodial bank to borrow against the cash collateral that is posted in connection with its securities lending program 
this is an uncommitted facility  which is contingent on the liquidity of the securities lending program 
the borrowing facility was established to fund commercial mortgage loans that were originated with the intent of sale through securitization 
these loans are collateral for the facility 
the maximum amount available under the agreement is million 
the borrowing rate on this program is equal to one month us libor 
nlic had million outstanding under this agreement as of december  in addition to the agreement described above  nmic has entered into an agreement with its custodial bank to borrow against the cash collateral that is posted in connection with its securities lending program 
this is an uncommitted facility  which is contingent on the liquidity of the securities lending program 
the borrowing 
table of contents facility was established to fund commercial mortgage loans that were originated with the intent of sale through securitization 
these loans are collateral for the facility 
because nlic has a variable interest in the profits from the securitization of these loans  nlic consolidates the assets and liabilities associated with these loans and the corresponding borrowings in accordance with fin r 
the maximum amount available under the agreement is million 
the borrowing rate on this program is equal to one month us libor 
nmic had million outstanding under this agreement as of december  a primary liquidity concern with respect to annuity and life insurance products is the risk of early policyholder withdrawal 
the company mitigates this risk by offering variable products where the investment risk is transferred to the policyholder  charging surrender fees at the time of withdrawal for certain products  applying a market value adjustment to withdrawals for certain products in the company s general account  and monitoring and matching anticipated cash inflows and outflows 
for individual annuity products billion of reserves as of december   the surrender charge is generally calculated as a percentage of the deposits made and is assessed at declining rates during the first seven years after a deposit is made 
for group annuity products billion of reserves as of december   the surrender charge amounts and periods can vary significantly  depending on the terms of each contract and the compensation structure for the producer 
generally  surrender charge percentages for group products are less than individual products because the company incurs lower expenses at contract origination for group products 
in addition  over ninety percent of the general account group annuity reserves are subject to a market value adjustment at withdrawal 
life insurance policies  while subject to withdrawal  are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity products because policyholders generally must undergo a new underwriting process and may incur a surrender fee in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
the short term and long term liquidity requirements of the company are monitored regularly to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
the company reviews its short term and long term projected sources and uses of funds and the asset liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections 
the company periodically makes adjustments to its investment policies to reflect changes in short term and long term cash needs and changing business and economic conditions 
given the company s historical cash flow and current financial results  management of the company believes that the cash flow from the operating activities of the company over the next year will provide sufficient liquidity for the operations of the company and will provide sufficient funds to enable the company to make dividend and interest payments 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report  the company acquired nfn effective october  the aggregate purchase price was billion  which was funded through a combination of the issuance of million shares of nfs class a common stock valued at million  the payment of million in cash and the issuance of million of policy credits 
of the total consideration  million was funded by provident mutual insurance company the name of the insurer before it was acquired by the company  and the remainder was funded with existing resources  including funds raised by the company in the form of senior debt issued in june the shares of the class a common stock issued in this transaction were valued using an average stock price covering the period extending two days before and after the date the consideration elections were closed 
the company has sold million of credit enhanced equity interests in low income housing tax credit funds tax credit funds to unrelated third parties 
the company has guaranteed cumulative after tax yields to third party investors ranging from to over periods ending between and and as 
table of contents of december  held guarantee reserves totaling million on these transactions 
these guarantees are in effect for periods of approximately years each 
the tax credit funds provide a stream of tax benefits to the investors that will generate a yield and return of capital 
if the tax benefits are not sufficient to provide these cumulative after tax yields  then the company must fund any shortfall  which is mitigated by stabilization collateral set aside by the company at the inception of the transactions 
the maximum amount of undiscounted future payments that the company could be required to pay the investors under the terms of the guarantees is billion 
the company does not anticipate making any payments related to the guarantees 
at the time of the sales  million of net sale proceeds were set aside as collateral for certain properties owned by the tax credit funds that had not met all of the criteria necessary to generate tax credits 
such criteria include completion of construction and the leasing of each unit to a qualified tenant  among others 
properties meeting the necessary criteria are considered to have stabilized 
the properties are evaluated regularly  and the collateral is released when stabilized 
during and  million and million of stabilization collateral had been released into income  respectively 
to the extent there are cash deficits in any specific property owned by the tax credit funds  property reserves  property operating guarantees and reserves held by the tax credit funds are exhausted before the company is required to perform under its guarantees 
to the extent the company is ever required to perform under its guarantees  it may recover any such funding out of the cash flow distributed from the sale of the underlying properties of the tax credit funds 
this cash flow distribution would be paid to the company prior to any cash flow distributions to unrelated third party investors

however  the impact of any such transactions would not be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
no contractual provisions exist that could create  accelerate or materially increase those obligations presented 
primarily related to investments in low income housing tax credit partnerships 
call dates for the obligations presented are either date or event specific 
the date specific requirement mandates the company fund a specified amount on a stated date provided there are no defaults under the agreement 
the event specific requirement is such that the company is obligated to fund a specified amount of its capital commitment when a property becomes fully stabilized 
the ultimate call date of these commitments may extend beyond one year but have been reflected in payments due in less than one year due to the call features 
the company s capital typically is called within one to four years  depending on when the events contemplated in the documents transpire

actual amounts will vary  potentially in a significant manner  from the amounts indicated due to deviations between assumptions and actual results and the addition of new business in future periods 
contractual provisions exist which could adjust the amount and or timing of those obligations reported 
key assumptions related to payments due by period include customer lapse rates including timing of death and future interest crediting level 
assumptions for future interest crediting levels have been made based on processes consistent with the company s past practices  which is at the discretion of the company  subject to guaranteed minimum crediting rates in many cases and or subject to contractually obligated increases for specified periods of time 
many of the contracts with potentially accelerated timing of payments are subject to surrender charges which are generally calculated as a percentage of deposits made and are assessed at declining rates during the first seven years after a deposit is made 
amounts disclosed herein include an estimate of those accelerated payments  net of applicable surrender charges

health reserves represent less than million of the amounts reflected in the table and are reflected in the less than one year column 
certain assumptions have been made about retirement patterns in the amounts reported 
actual retirements may differ significantly from those projected and may result in early withdrawal of contract funds  which could cause the timing of the obligations reported to vary significantly

off balance sheet transactions under the mtn program  nlic issues funding agreements to an unconsolidated third party trust to secure notes issued to investors by the trust 
the funding agreements rank pari passu with all other insurance claims of the issuing company in the event of liquidation and should be treated as annuities under applicable ohio insurance law 
therefore  the funding agreement obligations are classified as a component of future policy benefits and claims on the consolidated balance sheets 
because the company is not the primary beneficiary of  and has no ownership interest in  or control over  the third party trust that issues the mtns  the company does not include the trust in its consolidated financial statements

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive financial instruments the company is subject to potential fluctuations in earnings and the fair value of certain of its assets and liabilities  as well as variations in expected cash flows due to changes in market interest rates and equity prices 
the following discussion focuses on specific interest rate and equity price risks to which the company is exposed and describes strategies used to manage these risks 
the discussion is limited to financial instruments subject to market risks and is not intended to be a complete discussion of all of the risks to which the company is exposed 
interest rate risk fluctuations in interest rates can impact the company s earnings  cash flows and the fair value of its assets and liabilities 
in a declining interest rate environment  the company may be required to reinvest the proceeds from maturing and prepaying investments at rates lower than the overall yield of the portfolio  which could reduce future interest spread income 
in addition  minimum guaranteed crediting rates ranging from to for a majority of the individual annuity contracts in force on certain individual annuity contracts could prevent the company from lowering its interest crediting rates to levels commensurate with prevailing market interest rates  resulting in a reduction to the company s interest spread income in the event market interest rates remain at  or decline further from  december  levels 
the average crediting rate of fixed annuity products during was and for the individual investments and retirement plans segments  respectively  well in excess of the guaranteed rates 
the company mitigates this risk by managing the maturity and interest rate sensitivities of the assets to be consistent with those of the liabilities 
during  in response to the low interest rate environment  the company reduced commissions on fixed annuity sales  launched new products with new guaranteed rates  discontinued the sale of its leading annual reset fixed annuities and implemented limits on variable annuity allocations to the guaranteed fixed option 
in addition  the company adheres to a strict discipline of setting interest crediting rates on new business at levels adequate to provide returns consistent with management expectations 
conversely  a rising interest rate environment could result in a reduction in interest spread income or an increase in policyholder surrenders 
existing general account investments supporting annuity liabilities had a weighted average maturity of approximately years as of december  and therefore  the change in yield of the portfolio will lag changes in market interest rates 
this lag increases if the rate of prepayments of securities slows 
to the extent the company sets renewal rates based on current market rates  this will result in reduced interest spreads 
alternatively  if the company sets renewal crediting rates while attempting to maintain a desired spread from the portfolio yield  the rates offered by the company may be less than new money rates offered by competitors 
this difference could result in an increase in surrender activity by policyholders 
if the company was unable to fund surrenders with its cash flow from operations  the company might need to sell assets  which likely would have declined in value due to the increase in interest rates 
the company mitigates this risk by offering products that assess surrender charges and or market value adjustments at the time of surrender  and by managing the maturity and interest rate sensitivities of the assets to approximate those of the liabilities 
asset liability management strategies to manage interest rate risk the company employs an asset liability management approach tailored to the specific requirements of each of its products 
each line of business has an investment policy based on its specific characteristics 
the policy establishes asset maturity and duration  quality and other relevant guidelines 
an underlying pool or pools of investments  including combinations of common and dedicated asset pools  supports each general account line of business 
the common asset pools are generally maintained on the basis of the desired maturity characteristics of the assets used eg to years average weighted life 
the various lines 
table of contents of business are given ownership percentages of assets acquired by the pools depending on their contribution to the amounts purchased in the pools  in a manner analogous to investment year allocations 
this methodology is sometimes referred to as synthetic segmentation 
additionally  dedicated pools of assets have been created for certain liabilities or groups of liabilities within most lines 
these pools consist of whole assets purchased specifically for the underlying line of business 
in general  assets placed in any given portfolio remain there until they mature or are called  but active management of specific securities  sectors  and several top down risks may result in portfolio turnover 
investment strategies are executed by dedicated investment professionals based on the guidance established for the various pools 
to assist them in this regard  they receive periodic projections of investment needs from each line s management team 
line of business management teams  investment portfolio managers and finance professionals periodically evaluate how well assets purchased and the underlying portfolio match the underlying liabilities for each line 
strategy adjustments are made when needed 
using this information  in conjunction with each line s investment strategy  actual asset purchases or commitments are made 
in addition  plans for future asset purchases are formulated when appropriate 
this process is repeated frequently enough so that invested assets for each line match its investment needs as closely as possible 
the primary objectives are to ensure that each line s liabilities are invested in accordance with its investment strategy and that over or under investment is minimized 
as part of this process  the investment portfolio managers provide each line s actuaries with forecasts of anticipated rates that the line s future investments are expected to produce 
this information  in combination with yields attributable to the line s current investments and its investment rollovers  gives the line actuaries data to use in computing and declaring interest crediting rates for their lines of business 
there are two approaches to developing investment policies for liabilities where cash flows are not interest sensitive and the credited rate is fixed eg immediate annuities  the company manages risk with a combination cash matching duration matching strategy 
duration is a measure of the sensitivity of price to changes in interest rates 
for a rate movement of basis points  the fair value of liabilities with a duration of years would change by approximately 
for this type of liability  the company generally targets an asset liability duration mismatch of to years 
in addition  the company attempts to minimize asset and liability cash flow mismatches  especially over the first five years 
however  the desired degree of cash matching is balanced against the cost of cash matching 
for liabilities where the company has the right to modify the credited rate and policyholders also have options  the company s risk management process includes modeling both the assets and liabilities over multiple stochastic scenarios 
the company considers a range of potential policyholder behavior as well as the specific liability crediting strategy 
this analysis  combined with appropriate risk tolerances  drives the company s investment policy 
use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed rate investments ie certain fixed rate commercial mortgage loans and fixed rate corporate bonds due to changes in interest rates 
to manage this risk  the company enters into various types of derivative instruments to minimize fluctuations in fair values resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company principally uses interest rate swaps to manage this risk 
under interest rate swaps  the company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed rate payments 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps will increase decrease as interest rates increase decrease  which will offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate investment which will decrease increase as interest rates increase decrease 

table of contents with short euro futures  if interest rates increase decrease  the gains losses on the futures will offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate investment which will decrease increase as interest rates increase decrease 
as a result of entering into commercial mortgage loan and private placement commitments  the company is exposed to changes in the fair value of the commitment due to changes in interest rates during the commitment period 
to manage this risk  the company enters into short us treasury futures 
with short us treasury futures  if interest rates rise fall  the gains losses on the futures will offset the change in fair value of the commitment 
floating rate investments ie commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds expose the company to fluctuations in cash flow and investment income due to changes in interest rates 
to manage this risk  the company enters into receive fixed  pay variable over the counter interest rate swaps or long euro futures strips 
in using interest rate swaps  the company receives fixed interest rate payments and makes variable interest rate payments 
as the variable interest payments made on the interest rate swaps will offset the variable interest payments received on the floating rate investments  the company s net cash flow equals the fixed payments received on the interest rate swap 
with long euro futures  if interest rates increase decrease  the losses gains on the futures offset the decrease increase in the variable rate income on the investments 
the company manages interest rate risk at the segment level 
different segments may simultaneously hedge interest rate risks associated with owning fixed and variable rate investments considering the risk relevant to a particular segment 
foreign currency risk management in conjunction with the company s mtn program  the company periodically issues both fixed and variable rate liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  the company is exposed to changes in fair value of the liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage these risks  the company enters into cross currency swaps to convert these liabilities to a us dollar rate 
for a fixed rate liability  the cross currency interest rate swap is structured to receive a fixed rate  in the foreign currency  and pay a variable us dollar rate  generally month us libor 
for a variable rate foreign liability  the cross currency interest rate swap is structured to receive a variable rate  in the foreign currency  and pay a variable us dollar rate  generally month us libor 
the company is exposed to changes in fair value of fixed rate investments denominated in a foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage this risk  the company uses cross currency interest rate hedges to swap these asset characteristics to variable us dollar rate instruments 
cross currency interest rate swaps on assets are structured to pay a fixed rate  in the foreign currency  and receive a variable us dollar rate  generally month us libor 
cross currency interest rate swaps in place against each foreign currency obligation or investment hedge the company against adverse currency movements with respect to both period interest payments and principal repayment

table of contents additional information about the characteristics of the financial instruments and assumptions underlying the data presented in the table above are as follows mortgage backed and other asset backed securities the year of maturity is determined based on the terms of the securities and the current rate of prepayment of the underlying pools of mortgages or assets 
the company limits its exposure to prepayments by purchasing less volatile types of mbs and abs investments see securities available for sale in the investments section of md a for further discussion 
corporate bonds and other fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans on real estate the maturity year is that of the security or loan 
individual deferred fixed annuities the maturity year is based on the expected date of policyholder withdrawal  taking into account actual experience  current interest rates and contract terms 
individual deferred fixed annuities are certain individual annuity contracts  which are also subject to surrender charges calculated as a percentage of the deposits made and assessed at declining rates during the first seven years after a deposit is made 
also included in deferred fixed annuities were billion of participating group annuity contracts 
as of december   individual annuity general account liabilities totaling billion were in contracts where the crediting rate is reset periodically  with portions resetting in each calendar quarter  and million that reset annually 
individual fixed annuity policy reserves of billion were in contracts that adjust the crediting rate every five years 
individual fixed annuity policy reserves of million were in contracts that adjust the crediting rate every three years 
the average crediting rate is calculated as the difference between the projected yield of the assets backing the liabilities and a targeted interest spread 
however  for certain individual annuities the credited rate is also adjusted to partially reflect current new money rates 
group pension deferred fixed annuities the maturity year is based on the expected date of policyholder withdrawal  taking into account actual experience  current interest rates and contract terms 
included were group annuity contracts representing billion of general account liabilities as of december   which are generally subject to market value adjustment upon surrender and which also may be subject to surrender charges 
of the total group annuity liabilities  million were in contracts where the crediting rate is reset monthly  billion were in contracts where the crediting rate is reset quarterly  million were in contracts that adjust the crediting rate on an annual basis with portions resetting in each calendar quarter and billion were in contracts where the crediting rate is reset annually on january funding agreements backing mtns fixed annuity policy reserves of billion relate to funding agreements issued in conjunction with the company s mtn program where the crediting rate is either fixed for the term of the contract or variable  based on an underlying index 
immediate annuities non life contingent contracts in payout status where the company has guaranteed periodic payments  typically monthly  are included 
the maturity year is based on the terms of the contract 
short term debt and long term debt the maturity year is the stated maturity date of the obligation 
while certain obligations are callable  either at a premium or with a make whole provision  the company currently has no plans to call the obligations prior to the stated maturity date 
derivative financial instruments the maturity year is based on the terms of the related contract 
interest rate swaps include cross currency interest rate swaps that eliminate all of the company s existing asset and liability foreign currency exposure 
cross currency interest rate swaps in place against each foreign currency obligation hedge the company against adverse currency movements with respect to both period interest payments and principal repayment 
underlying details by currency have therefore been omitted 
variable swap rates and settlement prices reflect rates and prices in effect as of december  equity market risk asset fees calculated as a percentage of the separate account assets are a significant source of revenue to the company 
as of december   approximately of separate account assets were invested in equity 
table of contents mutual funds 
gains and losses in the equity markets result in corresponding increases and decreases in the company s separate account assets and the reported asset fee revenue 
in addition  a decrease in separate account assets may decrease the company s expectations of future profit margins due to a decrease in asset fee revenue and or an increase in gmdb claims  which may require the company to accelerate the amortization of dac 
the company s long term assumption for net separate account returns is annual growth  earned evenly throughout the year 
if equity markets were unchanged throughout a given year  the company estimates that its net income per diluted share  calculated using current weighted average diluted shares outstanding  would be approximately to less than had the company s long term assumption for net separate account returns been realized 
this analysis assumes no other factors change and that an unlocking of dac assumptions for individual variable annuities would not be required 
however  as it does each quarter  the company would evaluate its dac balance and underlying assumptions to determine whether unlocking is appropriate 
the company can provide no assurance that the experience of flat equity market returns would not result in changes to other factors affecting profitability  including the possibility of unlocking of dac assumptions for individual variable annuities 
many of the company s individual variable annuity contracts offer gmdb features 
a gmdb generally provides a benefit if the annuitant dies and the contract value is less than a contractually defined amount 
such specified amounts vary from contract to contract based on the date the contract was entered into as well as the gmdb feature elected 
a decline in the stock market may cause the contract value to fall below this specified amount and the net amount at risk to increase 
the net amount at risk is the amount by which the gmdb exceeds the contract value at any given time and is a primary indicator of potential future gmdb claims 
as of december   the net amount at risk  net of amounts reinsured  was million 
to manage this risk  the company has implemented a gmdb hedging program for certain new and existing business 
the program  which is an economic hedge but does not qualify for hedge accounting under current accounting guidance  is designed to offset a specified portion of changes in the value of the gmdb obligation 
currently the program shorts s p index futures  which in turn provides a partial offset to changes in the value of the designated obligation 
prior to implementation of the gmdb hedging program in  the company managed the risk of these benefits primarily by entering into reinsurance arrangements 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report for additional disclosures about gmdb risk 
the company also offers certain variable annuity products with a guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab rider 
a gmab provides the contract holder with a guaranteed return of premium  adjusted proportionately for withdrawals  after a specified period of time  or years selected by the contract holder at the issuance of the variable annuity contract 
in some cases  the contract holder also has the option  after a specified period of time  to drop the rider and continue the variable annuity contract without the gmab 
a gmab is an embedded derivative  and as such  the equity exposure in this product is recognized at fair value  separately from the annuity contract  with changes in fair value recognized in the statements of income 
the company is exposed to equity market risk to the extent that the underlying investment options  which can include fixed and variable components selected by the contract holder  do not generate enough earnings over the life of the contract to at least equal the adjusted premiums 
the company is economically hedging the gmab exposure for those risks that exceed a level considered acceptable by purchasing interest rate futures and shorting s p futures 
the gmab economic hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting under current accounting guidance 
upon reaching scale  the company anticipates the purchase of s p index put options and over the counter basket put options  which are constructed in order to minimize the tracking error of the hedge and the gmab liability 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report for additional disclosures about gmab risk
