item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of regal and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview and basis of presentation we conduct our operations primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries  regal cinemas  united artists  edwards  hoyts and regal cinemedia 
we operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the united states  consisting of  screens in theatres in states as of december  regal cinemedia focuses exclusively on the expansion of ancillary businesses  such as advertising  and complementary business lines that leverage our existing asset and customer bases 
we believe the size  reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale in our theatre operations and capitalize on regal cinemedia s ancillary revenue opportunities 
we generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales 
additional revenues are generated by on screen advertisements  rental of theatres for business meetings  concerts and other events distributed on a live or pre recorded basis by regal cinemedia over the dcn  vendor marketing programs and electronic video games located adjacent to the lobbies of certain of our theatres 
film rental costs depend on a variety of factors including the prospects of a film  the popularity of a film and the length of time since the film s release and generally decline as a percentage of admission revenues the longer a film is in exhibition 
because we purchase certain concession items  such as fountain drinks and popcorn  in bulk and not pre packaged for individual servings  we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts 
other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs

prior to fiscal  we reported the results of our operations under one reportable segment theatre exhibition operations 
as of december   we manage our business under two reportable segments theatre exhibition operations and regal cinemedia 
for a discussion of our reportable segments  including financial information for each segment for each of the last three fiscal years  including fiscal  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of industry trends as well as other risks and uncertainties relevant to the company  see business industry trends above and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors below 
results of operations based on our review of industry sources  national box office revenues were estimated to have increased approximately one to two percent for the calendar year of over the calendar year of we believe that the slight increase in national box office revenues resulted from increased average ticket prices per patron  partially offset by a slight decline in national attendance 
the increase in average ticket price per patron is primarily attributable to increases in ticket prices and a favorable first quarter film mix consisting of a higher percentage of r rated films  which resulted in sales of a greater proportion of full price tickets 
throughout the remainder of  the film mix shifted to a more family oriented and concession friendly product  which moderated average ticket prices  but favorably impacted average concession revenues per patron 
the lackluster performance of certain holiday films during the fourth quarter of in comparison to holiday films of the fourth quarter of contributed to the overall decline in national attendance during our total revenue for year ended december  fiscal period was  million  a decrease from total revenue of  million for the year ended january  fiscal period 
on a comparative basis  results for the fiscal period were positively impacted by the timing of our fiscal calendar which consisted of fifty three weeks compared to the fifty two weeks in the fiscal period 
the fiscal period s additional week of operations is significant in that it accounted for approximately of the fiscal period total attendance 
offsetting the impact of the timing of the fiscal period  the fiscal period results benefited from the results of operations of the acquired hoyts cinemas theatres for all periods  whereas the results of operations of the acquired hoyts cinemas theatres were excluded from the first three months of the fiscal period because the hoyts cinemas acquisition did not occur until march  in addition  the fiscal period includes results of operations of operating theatres acquired during the second and third quarters of see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
as a net result of the above factors  the fiscal period box office results were negatively impacted by a net decline in attendance of approximately  partially offset by a increase in average ticket prices per patron due to increases in retail ticket prices and sales of a greater proportion of full price tickets from r rated films during the first quarter of the fiscal period 
on a same screen basis  the company s calendar box office revenue growth approximated the industry box office revenue growth for the comparative time period in the prior year 
during the fiscal period  we achieved growth in average concession revenues per patron and other operating revenues 
the growth in average concession revenues per patron was benefited by price increases and a return to family oriented and concession friendly film product in the second and third quarters of the fiscal period 
in addition  an increase of in regal cinemedia revenues contributed to the increase in other operating revenues for the fiscal period 
income from operations decreased to million for the fiscal period compared to million in the fiscal period 
net income decreased to million in the fiscal period as compared to net income of million in the fiscal period 
earnings per diluted share decreased to for the fiscal period compared to during the fiscal period 
ebitda was million for the fiscal period  a decrease of from million in the fiscal period and represented an ebitda margin of 
the decline in net income  diluted earnings per share  ebitda and ebitda margin is primarily attributable to the factors discussed above and a loss on extinguishment of debt of million recorded in the fiscal period as a result of the refinancing transactions consummated in connection with the extraordinary dividend transaction described further in notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
a tabular reconciliation of net income to ebitda and net cash provided by operating activities is provided below under results of operations ebitda 
during the fiscal period  the company made significant progress with its strategic initiatives we demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders 
total cash dividends distributed to our stockholders during the fiscal period  including the million extraordinary dividend paid on june   totaled approximately million 
during the second and third quarters of  we announced two increases totaling approximately to our quarterly class a and class b common stock cash dividend of per share and per share  respectively 
in addition  during the fiscal period  we instituted a share repurchase program  which provides for the authorization to repurchase up to million of our outstanding class a common stock 
no repurchases were effected during the fiscal period 
on april   we acquired five theatres representing screens in the northeastern united states 
on may   we acquired an additional two theatres with screens also in the northeastern united states 
on september   we acquired theatres comprising screens including two theatres with screens under construction in california and hawaii from signature theatres 
the total aggregate cash purchase price for the combined acquisitions totaled approximately million  including approximately million for the signature theatres acquisition  subject to post closing adjustments 
during the fiscal period  these acquisitions contributed approximately million attendees or to our total attendance 
these acquisitions are consistent with our commitment to consummate accretive acquisitions that enhance our asset base and improve our consolidated operating results 
in addition to the fiscal acquisitions  we opened three new theatres with screens  added screens through expansion to existing facilities and closed theaters with screens  ending the fiscal period with theaters and  screens 
our regal cinemedia business continued to contribute incremental revenue and ebitda for the fiscal period 
regal cinemedia s ebitda totaled approximately million  an increase of over the prior year 
our regal cinemedia ebitda margins increased as we ended the fiscal period approximately ahead of the fiscal period 
a tabular reconciliation of net income to ebitda and net cash provided by operating activities is provided below under results of operations ebitda 
we remain optimistic regarding the film slate and share the view of a number of film studio executives and analysts who believe the industry is poised to benefit from a year of solid box office performance 
evidenced by the film studios continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases  appears to be another year of high profile releases such as war of the worlds  king kong  star wars episode iii  harry potter and the goblet of fire and batman begins 
during  we believe that the industry screen count grew by approximately while the company s average screen count declined by less than 
we intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions 
with respect to capital expenditures  due in part to the timing of certain construction projects  we expect theatre capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million for fiscal  consisting of new theatre development  expansion of existing theatre facilities  upgrades and maintenance 
in addition  we are forecasting approximately million of regal cinemedia capital expenditures 
we will continue to focus on a simple business strategy including evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities  enhancement of attractive business opportunities through regal cinemedia  and continued pursuit of a business strategy that will provide incremental returns to our stockholders

as a net result of the above factors  the fiscal period box office results were negatively impacted by a net decline in attendance of approximately  partially offset by a increase in average ticket prices per patron due to increases in retail ticket prices and sales of a greater proportion of full price tickets from r rated films during the first quarter of the fiscal period

the decrease in income from operations during the fiscal period is primarily attributable to the timing of our fiscal period calendar  which resulted in a decline in total revenue in comparison to the fiscal period calendar  increases in certain operating expense items  including a loss on a lawsuit settlement arising from the exhibition of a film  partially offset by the inclusion of the results of operations of the acquired hoyts cinemas theatres and the fiscal period acquisitions  increases in regal cinemedia revenues  certain realized benefits associated with the integration of hoyts and the fiscal period acquisitions and a reduction of merger and restructuring expenses 
interest expense net interest expense increased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in interest expense in the fiscal period is principally due to higher outstanding indebtedness as a result of the financing arrangements consummated in the second quarter of in connection with the extraordinary dividend transaction described further in notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k

ebitda ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization was approximately million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal period  million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal period and million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal period 
we believe ebitda provides a useful measure of liquidity and financial performance for our investors because ebitda is an industry comparative measure of liquidity and financial performance prior to the payment of interest and taxes and because it is a primary financial measure used by management to assess our performance and liquidity 
ebitda is not a measurement of liquidity or financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for net income or other operations data or cash flow data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for purposes of analyzing our profitability or liquidity 
in addition  not all funds depicted by ebitda are available for management s discretionary use 
for example  a substantial portion of such funds are subject to contractual restrictions and functional requirements for debt service  fund necessary capital expenditures and to meet other commitments from time to time as described in more detail in this form k 
ebitda  as calculated  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period in millions net income interest expense  net provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization total ebitda ebitda theatre group  net of inter company eliminations ebitda rcm total ebitda interest expense  net provision for income taxes deferred income taxes changes in operating assets and liabilities loss on extinguishment of debt other items  net net cash provided by operating activities cash flows the following table summarizes certain cash flow data for the fiscal  and periods fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents fiscal period compared to fiscal period cash flows generated from operating activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to approximately million for the fiscal period 
the million net decrease was attributable to a million decrease in net income offset by a net increase of million in adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities 
such adjustments primarily included a million loss on the extinguishment of debt and an increase in depreciation and amortization of million  which is primarily attributable to increases in depreciation expense related to regal cinemedia  the inclusion of the fiscal period acquisitions and the inclusion of hoyts during the entire fiscal period as compared to only nine months during the fiscal period 
in addition  a net decrease of million in changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities 
the net decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to the timing of certain vendor payments and income tax payments and an increase in deferred revenues 
the changes in certain other working capital items were primarily related to the change in the company s calendar for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
capital expenditures were million for the fiscal period compared to million for the fiscal period 
this decrease is primarily due to fewer capital expenditures associated with regal cinemedia and the timing of certain capital projects during the fiscal period 
during the fiscal period  the company consummated three acquisitions for a net aggregate purchase price of million 
also during the fiscal period  regal cinemas entered into a sale and leaseback transaction involving one of its owned theatres for total sale proceeds of approximately million 
cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period is primarily attributable to the june  extraordinary dividend payment  redemption of a portion of the senior subordinated notes  repayment of the third amended and restated regal cinemas senior credit facility and increases in our fiscal period dividend payments  offset by borrowings under the new  million regal cinemas senior credit facility entered into on may  the senior credit facility 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further description of such financing transactions 
fiscal period compared to fiscal period cash flows generated from operating activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net increase was attributable to a million increase in net income partially offset by a net decrease of million in adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities 
such adjustments included a reduction in deferred income taxes of million partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of million 
in addition  a net increase of million in changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
the net increase in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to a million increase in income taxes payable coupled with increases in the change in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
capital expenditures were million for the fiscal period compared to million for the fiscal period 
such increase is primarily due to the inclusion of hoyts from march  and a full twelve months of operations of regal cinemas and united artists during the fiscal period coupled with incremental capital expenditures associated with regal cinemedia  which did not begin substantive operations until the second fiscal quarter of cash flows used in investing activities for the fiscal period also reflect approximately million of net cash used to acquire hoyts 
cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net increase in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period is primarily attributable to the financing transactions and related payment of the extraordinary dividend  which is discussed more fully under liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis  we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses  capital expenditures  general corporate purposes related to corporate operations  debt service and the company s quarterly dividend 
the principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  cash on hand and the revolving facility provided for under regal cinemas senior credit facility 
under the terms of the senior credit facility  regal cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to regal  its indirect parent 
since regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than its subsidiaries  this restriction could impact regal s ability to effect future debt or dividend payments  pay corporate expenses or redeem its convertible senior notes 
our revenues are generally collected in cash through admissions and concessions revenues 
our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs  rent and occupancy  and payroll 
film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the company s concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately days from purchase 
our current liabilities generally include items that will become due within twelve months and  as a result  at any given time  our balance sheet is likely to reflect a working capital deficit 
we fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows  cash on hand  proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities 
our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres  new theatre construction  adding new screens to existing theatres  development of our dcn  upgrading the company s theatre facilities and replacing equipment 
we intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities 
we currently expect capital expenditures for theatre development  replacement  expansion  upgrading and maintenance to be in the range of million to million in fiscal  exclusive of acquisitions 
such capital expenditures are expected to be partially funded through asset dispositions 
in addition to capital expenditures associated with our theatre operations  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million in connection with regal cinemedia during fiscal regal cinemedia capital expenditures will be made in connection with the deployment of our dcn to provide advertising and promotional services and digital distribution content capabilities to additional markets coupled with expenditures for other in lobby advertising and promotional initiatives 
during the fiscal period  we invested an aggregate of approximately million in capital expenditures 
in may  we sold million shares of our class a common stock in an initial public offering at a price of per share  receiving aggregate net offering proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering expenses  of approximately million 
on august   reh acquired the remaining outstanding shares of common stock of united artists held by the united artists minority stockholders and warrants to acquire shares of common stock of united artists held by various institutional holders for approximately million 
the million difference between the carrying amount and purchase price of the minority interest was recorded as a component of goodwill 
on march   we completed our acquisition of certain theatre operations of hoyts representing a total of theatres and screens located in states in the northeastern united states for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the purchase price included cash of approximately million  the issuance of  shares of regal s class a common stock to hush holdings us inc hush with an aggregate fair value of million and the assumption of certain capital lease obligations with an aggregate fair value of approximately million 
on may   all outstanding warrants held by anschutz to purchase a total of  shares of class b common stock and warrants held by certain other investors to purchase a total of  shares of class a common stock were exercised at exercise prices of per share 
proceeds from the transactions totaled approximately million 
on june   regal declared an extraordinary cash dividend of per share on each outstanding share of its class a and class b common stock 
stockholders of record at the close of business on june  were paid this dividend on july  sources used to fund the approximate million extraordinary dividend included cash on hand of approximately million  the net proceeds of million from the term loan under the senior credit facility and the net proceeds of million from the issuance by regal of million convertible senior notes on may  the convertible senior notes 
the dividend was recorded as a reduction of retained earnings reduced to zero as of june  and additional paid in capital upon declaration 
concurrent with the issuance of our convertible senior notes  we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our class a common stock in order to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the notes into shares of our class a common stock 
the net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was approximately million and is included as a component of stockholders equity 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in the form k for further description of the convertible senior notes and the related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
the convertible senior notes allow us to settle any conversion  and we have the ability and intent to settle any conversion  by remitting to the note holder the accreted value of the note in cash  while settling the conversion spread the excess conversion value over the accreted value in the shares of our class a common stock 
based upon our ability to generate cash flow from operations  our financial capacity and ability to raise capital and available cash on hand  we believe that we have the ability to generate the liquidity necessary to settle in cash the principal amount of the convertible senior notes upon a conversion event 
on april   regal acquired five theatres representing screens in the northeastern united states 
on may   regal acquired an additional two theatres with screens in the northeastern united states 
on september   regal acquired theatres comprising screens including two theatres with screens under construction in california and hawaii from signature theatres

a portion of the net proceeds from regal cinemas senior credit facility was used to fund the approximate million extraordinary dividend 
on july   regal cinemas entered into four hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with final maturity terms ranging from three to five years each 
these swaps were assigned to hedge approximately million of variable rate liabilities under the senior credit facility 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  regal cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from and will receive interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
the month libor rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three month period 
the interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter  until expiration

interest rate swaps on july   regal cinemas entered into four hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with final maturity terms ranging from three to five years each 
these swaps were assigned to hedge approximately million of variable rate liabilities under the senior credit facility 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  regal cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from to and will receive interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
the month libor rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three month period 
the interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter  until expiration 
at such dates  the differences to be paid or received on the swaps will be included in interest expense 
no premium or discount was incurred upon the company entering into the swaps  because the pay and receive rates on the swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the swaps were entered into 
the interest rate swaps prospectively qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as such  the company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the month libor on approximately million of the aforementioned credit facility 
the change in the fair values of the swaps is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings 
as interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the designated hedging instruments the four interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps is based on dealer quotes  and represents an estimate of the amounts regal cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors  including current interest rates 
as of december   the aggregate fair value of the swaps was determined to be approximately million  which has been recorded as a component of other non current liabilities with a corresponding amount of million  net of tax  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the swaps exhibited no ineffectiveness for the year ended december  sale leaseback transactions for information regarding our various sale and leaseback transactions  refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included part ii  item of this form k 
bankruptcy claims regal cinemas  inc has bankruptcy claims that remain unsettled and are subject to ongoing negotiation and possible litigation 
at december   regal cinemas had accrued approximately million for the estimated costs to resolve such bankruptcy claims 
in the opinion of management  based on its examination of these matters  its experience to date and discussions with legal counsel  the outcome of these legal matters  after taking into consideration the amounts already accrued  is not expected to have a material effect on the company s liquidity or results of operations 
to the extent claims are allowed by the bankruptcy court  they will be funded with cash on hand or cash flow from operations 
for a detailed discussion of the bankruptcy proceedings  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions  which includes  but are not limited to  those related to film costs  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes and purchase accounting 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording the acquisitions of hoyts and other subsequent acquisitions 
these accounting principles require that we estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities  including the related deferred tax assets and liabilities related to such amounts 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts 
we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets in sfas specifies that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to an annual impairment assessment 
based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the goodwill  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
we estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management s best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors 
generally  less than one third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period end 
the length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play  but is typically settled within two to three months of a particular film s opening release 
upon settlement with our film distributors  film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement 
such adjustments have been historically insignificant 
actual film costs and film costs payable could differ materially from those estimates 
for the fiscal years ended december   january  and december   there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures 
we depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
each owned theatre consists of a building structure  structural improvements  seating and concession and film display equipment 
while we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than years to certain acquired facilities  we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life to us of years 
certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than forty years 
with respect to equipment eg  concession stand  point of sale equipment and certain dcn assets  a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less  which has been our historical replacement period 
seats and projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life  and their depreciable lives years are based on our experience and replacement practices 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized 
further  we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary 
actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates 
the majority of our properties were appraised as part of the bankruptcy process 
such appraisals supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes 
furthermore  our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies 
finally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
such analysis evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis 
when the future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  such assets are written down to fair value 
our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical wear and tear or functional inadequacy or obsolescence factors 
in this regard  we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods 
for the fiscal years ended december   january  and december   no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization  or the methodology applied 
for the fiscal year ended december   consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was million  representing of consolidated total revenues 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately million or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately million or 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on their probable tax treatment 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
an increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
with the exception of valuation allowances recorded relative to pre acquisition periods  decreases in the valuation allowance generally result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes 
should we ultimately realize a benefit from tax assets in excess of the amount recorded that relates to pre acquisition periods  goodwill would be reduced to the extent of such excess or recorded goodwill  as appropriate 
additionally  income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation and require judgment by us and may be challenged by the tax authorities 
accordingly  although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we establish accruals relative to tax uncertainties that we deem to be probable of loss and that can be reasonably estimated 
such accruals are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes 
among other items deemed relevant by us  the evaluations are based on new legislation  other new technical guidance  judicial proceedings  and our specific circumstances  including the progress of tax audits 
with the exception of certain changes in pre acquisition tax uncertainties  any change in the balance of an accrual established relative to a tax uncertainty impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that the adjustment is made to the accrual 
for the fiscal year ended december   our provision for income taxes was million 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained  the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate 
a one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from to would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately million 
quarterly results the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended january  include the results of operations of united artists  edwards and regal cinemas from december  and hoyts from march  the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  include the results of operations of united artists  regal cinemas  edwards and hoyts from january   the results of operations of seven theatres acquired during the quarter ended july  and the operating theatres acquired from signature theatres on september  for periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates

the fourth quarter of the fiscal period includes one additional week of operations 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
seasonality the company s revenues are usually seasonal  coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors 
generally  studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday seasons 
the unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern 
the timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations  and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other quarter 
the seasonality of motion picture exhibition  however  has become less pronounced in recent years as studios have begun to release major motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year

these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain risk factors as more fully discussed under risk factors below 
risk factors investing in our securities involves a significant degree of risk 
in addition to the other information contained in this annual report  you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities 
our substantial lease and debt obligations could impair our financial condition we have substantial lease and debt obligations 
for fiscal  our total rent expense and net interest expense were approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had total long term obligations of  million 
as of december   we had total contractual cash obligations of approximately  million 
for a detailed discussion of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments over the next several years  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations and commitments provided above 
if we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations  we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional equity financing or sell assets 
we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations 
many of our lease agreements and the agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions or require us not to allow specific events to occur and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that we must meet 
if we violate those restrictive covenants or fail to meet the minimum financial requirements contained in a lease or debt instrument  we would be in default under that instrument  which could  in turn  result in defaults under other leases and debt instruments 
any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity 
our theatres operate in a competitive environment 
the motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry 
theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres  particularly with respect to film licensing  attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites 
moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location  the films showing there and its amenities 
in recent years  motion picture exhibitors have been upgrading their asset bases to an attractive megaplex format which features stadium seating  improved projection quality and superior sound systems 
generally  a modern megaplex is preferred by patrons over a slope floored multiplex theatre  which was the dominant theatre type built prior to although  as of december   approximately of our screens were located in theatres featuring stadium seating  we still serve many markets with profitable sloped floored multiplex theatres 
these theatres may be more vulnerable to competition than our modern megaplex theatres  and should other theatre operators choose to build and operate modern megaplex theatres in these markets  the performance of our theatres in these markets may be significantly and negatively impacted 
in addition  should other theatre operators return to the aggressive building strategies undertaken from to  our attendance  revenue and income from operations per screen could decline substantially 
our in theatre advertising business operates in a competitive environment 
regal cinemedia s in theatre advertising operations must compete with a number of other cinema advertising companies and advertising mediums including  most notably  television  newspaper  radio and the internet 
there can be no guarantee that in theatre advertising will continue to attract major advertisers or that regal cinemedia s in theatre advertising format will be favorably received by the theatre going public 
if regal cinemedia is unable to generate expected sales of advertising  it may not maintain the level of profitability we hope to achieve  and its results of operations may be adversely affected 
we depend on motion picture production and performance 
our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability  diversity and appeal of motion pictures  our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets 
we mostly license first run motion pictures  the success of which have increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major studios 
poor performance of  or any disruption in the production of including by reason of a strike these motion pictures  or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major studios  could hurt our business and results of operations 
in addition  a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers 
we depend on our relationships with film distributors 
the film distribution business is highly concentrated  with ten major film distributors reportedly accounting for of admissions revenues and all of the top grossing films during our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors 
in addition  we are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first run films 
a deterioration in our relationship with any of the nine major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and  therefore  could hurt our business and results of operations 
no assurance of a supply of motion pictures 
the distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases 
consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors  including us  on a film by film and theatre by theatre basis 
consequently  we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long term arrangements with major distributors  but must compete for our licenses on a film by film and theatre by theatre basis 
we may not benefit from our acquisition strategy 
we may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition candidates 
even if we do identify such candidates  we anticipate significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates  and there can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms 
moreover  some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are 
as a result of this competition for limited assets  we may not succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition 
if we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates  we may not be able to successfully expand our operations and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected 
in any acquisition  we expect to benefit from cost savings through  for example  the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs  and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits 
nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to service debt incurred to finance an acquisition  our results of operations and profitability would be adversely affected 
any acquisition may involve operating risks  such as the difficulty of assimilating the acquired operations and personnel and integrating them into our current business  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the diversion of management s attention and other resources  the possible inability of management to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the risks of entering markets in which we have little or no experience  the potential impairment of relationships with employees  the possibility that any liabilities we may incur or assume may prove to be more burdensome than anticipated  and the possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected 
we must comply with the ada 
our theatres must comply with the ada 
compliance with the ada requires that public accommodations reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations 
noncompliance with the ada  including with respect to lines of sight and other requirements currently in dispute as described in greater detail in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k  could result in the imposition of injunctive relief  fines  an award of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance 
any such imposition of injunctive relief  fines  damage awards or capital expenditures could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
an increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and limit ticket prices 
we also compete with other movie delivery vehicles  including cable television  downloads via the internet  video disks and cassettes  satellite and pay per view services 
further  technologies for movie delivery such as video on demand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we also compete for the public s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment  including sporting events  concerts  live theatre and restaurants 
development of digital technology may increase our capital expenses 
the industry is in the early stages of conversion from film based media to electronic based media 
there are a variety of constituencies associated with this anticipated change  which may significantly impact industry participants  including content providers  distributors  equipment providers and exhibitors 
should the conversion process rapidly accelerate and the major studios not finance the conversion as expected  we may have to raise additional capital to finance the conversion costs associated with this potential change 
the additional capital necessary may not  however  be available to us on attractive terms  if at all 
furthermore  it is impossible to accurately predict how the roles and allocation of costs including operating costs between various industry participants will change if the industry changes from physical media to electronic media 
we depend on our senior management 
our success depends upon the retention of our senior management  including michael campbell and kurt hall  our co chairmen and co chief executive officers 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services were no longer available 
the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance for any of our employees 
the loss of any member of senior management could adversely affect our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy 
the interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests 
anschutz owns substantially all of our outstanding class b common stock 
our class a common stock has one vote per share while our class b common stock has ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders 
as a result  as of december   anschutz controlled approximately of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
for as long as anschutz continues to own shares of common stock representing more than of the voting power of our common stock  it will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including matters involving mergers or other business combinations  the acquisition or disposition of assets  the incurrence of indebtedness  the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on common stock 
anschutz will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control  and could take other actions that might be desirable to anschutz but not to other stockholders 
in addition  anschutz and its affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries  including interests in the sports  motion picture production and music entertainment industries 
in the future  it may combine our company with one or more of its other holdings 
a prolonged economic downturn could materially affect our business by reducing consumer spending on movie attendance 
we depend on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities 
motion picture theatre attendance may be affected by prolonged negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending  including such trends resulting from terrorist attacks on  or wars or threatened wars involving  the united states 
any reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for motion pictures or severely impact the motion picture production industry  which  in turn  could adversely affect our operations 
our results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis and may be unpredictable  which could increase the volatility of our stock price 
our revenues are usually seasonal because of the way the major film distributors release films 
generally  the most marketable movies are released during the summer and the holiday season 
poor performance of these films  or a disruption in the release of films during these periods  could hurt our results for the entire fiscal year 
an unexpected hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend 
the timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations  and our results of operations for one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any other fiscal period 
these variations in results could cause increased volatility in our stock price 
our stock price may be volatile and decline substantially the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the purchased market price because of a number of factors  including actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  changes in the market valuations of other companies  announcements relating to strategic relationships  acquisitions or industry consolidation  and general economic  market and political conditions not related to our business 
a substantial number of restricted shares are eligible for sale which could cause the market price for our class a common stock to decline 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that market sales of shares of our class a common stock or the availability of shares of our class a common stock for sale will have on the market price of our class a common stock prevailing from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of shares of our class a common stock in the public market  or the perception that those sales will occur  could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline 
as of march   we had outstanding  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock that may convert into class a common stock on a one for one basis  all of which shares of common stock constitute restricted securities under the securities act 
provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in rule under the securities act  all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradable 
anschutz  oaktree s principal activities group and certain other significant stockholders are able to sell their shares pursuant to the registration rights that we have granted as described in description of capital stock registration rights 
we cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our class a common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of  or following  any divestiture by anschutz  oaktree s principal activities group or our directors or executive officers of their shares of our common stock 
additionally  as of march   approximately  shares of our class a common stock are issuable upon exercise of stock options that vest and are exercisable at various dates through june   with exercise prices ranging from to 
of such options  as of march    were exercisable 
all of such shares subject to options are registered and will be freely tradable when the option is exercised unless such shares are acquired by an affiliate of regal  in which case the affiliate may only sell the shares subject to the volume limitations imposed by rule of the securities act 
the sale of a substantial number of shares may make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future 
sales of substantial amounts of shares of our class a common stock in the public market  or the perception that those sales will occur  might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
if we are unable to sell equity securities at times and prices that we deem appropriate  our ability to fund growth could be adversely affected 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws  as amended  contain anti takeover protections  which may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws  as amended  as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law  could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us  even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders 
our issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company 
our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue  without any further vote or action by the stockholders  up to  shares of preferred stock  par value per share  in one or more series  to designate the number of shares constituting any series  and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof  including dividend rights  voting rights  rights and terms of redemption  redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders  even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares 
our issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class  or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock 
our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights  liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive 
for example  investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock 
we are a holding company dependent on our subsidiaries for our ability to service our debt and pay our dividends 
we are a holding company with no operations of our own 
consequently  our ability to service our subsidiaries debt and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
any distribution of earnings to us from our subsidiaries  or advances or other distributions of funds by these subsidiaries to us  all of which are subject to statutory or contractual restrictions  are contingent upon the subsidiaries earnings and are subject to various business considerations 
our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization  and therefore the right of the holders of the convertible senior notes and our common stock to participate in those assets  will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors 
in addition  even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries  our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us 
payment of our extraordinary dividends could impair our ability to fund capital requirements or service our debt obligations and may have adverse tax consequences to the holders of the convertible senior notes 
on july   we paid to our stockholders an extraordinary cash dividend of per share on each outstanding share of class a and class b common stock totaling approximately million in the aggregate 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from our million convertible senior notes offering  as well as the net proceeds from an additional term loan facility under the regal cinemas senior credit facility of approximately million and approximately million of cash on hand to pay this extraordinary dividend 
on june   we paid another extraordinary cash dividend of per share on each share of our outstanding class a and class b common stock totaling approximately million in the aggregate 
we funded the dividend from internally generated funds and the net proceeds of the completion of our billion recapitalization transaction 
the extraordinary dividends reduced our available funds and could adversely affect our ability to fund potential acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital or other expenditures  including capital expenditures of regal cinemedia 
the reduction in available funds could also materially affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations including settling the accreted value of the convertible senior notes in cash 
our payment of the extraordinary dividends resulted in antidilution adjustments to the conversion price of the convertible senior notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the convertible senior notes 
upon the conversion of the convertible senior notes  additional shares of common stock received as a result of those increases may be deemed to be payments of taxable dividends to a holder of the convertible senior notes to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
hedging transactions and other transactions we have entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our common stock  the exposure for which was held at the time the convertible senior notes were issued by credit suisse first boston international 
the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the notes 
in connection with these hedging arrangements  credit suisse first boston international has taken positions in our class a common stock in secondary market transactions and or entered into various derivative transactions after the pricing of the notes 
such hedging arrangements could increase the price of our class a common stock 
credit suisse first boston international is likely to modify its hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion  redemption or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our class a common stock  other securities of regal or other instruments we may wish to use in connection with such hedging 
we cannot assure you that such activity will not affect the market price of our class a common stock 
for further description of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is confined to interest rate exposure of its and its wholly owned subsidiaries debt obligations that bear interest based on floating rates 
the senior credit agreement provides for variable rate interest that could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates 
as of december   borrowings of  million under the term facility were outstanding 
borrowings under the term facility bear interest  at regal cinemas option  at either an adjusted eurodollar rate or a base rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the base rate is the higher of prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 
the borrowings outstanding under the term facility bore interest of approximately as of december  during the year ended december   regal cinemas entered into four distinct hedging relationships via four separate interest rate swap agreements with final maturity terms ranging from three to five years each for the purpose of hedging approximately million of variable interest rate risk under the senior credit facility 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  regal cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from and receives interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
for a further description of the swap agreements  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
a one half percent rise in the interest rate on the company s unhedged variable rate indebtedness approximately million at december   would have increased reported interest expense by approximately million for the year ended december
