table of contents the company commenced operations on december  and  as a result  underwrote only one reinsurance policy during the period ended december  fair value of warrants issued to the founding shareholders 
the warrants are classified as equity instruments  and in accordance with eitf  the estimated aggregate fair value was reported as an expense and an addition to additional paid in capital 
basic earnings loss per share is calculated using the basic weighted average number of common shares 
diluted earnings per share assumes the exercise of all dilutive warrants and options  using the treasury stock method 
the loss ratio is calculated by dividing loss and loss adjustment expenses by net premiums earned 
the expense ratio is calculated by dividing acquisition costs plus general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned 
combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
book value per share is calculated using total shareholders equity divided by basic shares outstanding 
fully converted book value per share is a non gaap measure  based on total shareholder s equity plus the assumed proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants of million for the year ended december  and million  for the year ended december   and divided by the sum of shares  options and warrants outstanding assuming their exercise of  shares at december    shares at december  and and  shares at december  the company believes that fully converted book value per share more accurately reflects the value attributable to a common share

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended december   and and financial condition as at december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are not historical facts  including statements about the company s beliefs and expectations 
these statements are based upon current plans  estimates and projections 
our actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
see cautionary statement under safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of and risk factors contained in item business of this filing 

table of contents executive overview our principal operating subsidiary  montpelier re  operates as a bermuda based provider of global property and casualty reinsurance and insurance products 
we operate in markets where we believe our underwriting expertise and financial strength represent a relative advantage 
our profitability in any given period is based upon our premium and investment revenues less net loss and loss adjustment expenses 
premiums are a function of the number and type of reinsurance and insurance contracts we write  as well as prevailing market prices 
renewal dates for reinsurance business tends to be concentrated at the beginning of quarters  and the timing of premium written varies by line of business 
most property catastrophe business is written in the january  april  june and july renewal periods  while the property specialty and other specialty lines are written throughout the year 
written premiums are generally lower during the fourth quarter of the year as compared to prior quarters 
the following are the main categories of gross premium written property specialty contracts in this category include risk excess of loss  property pro rata and direct insurance and facultative reinsurance business 
risk excess of loss reinsurance protects insurance companies on their primary insurance risks and facultative reinsurance transactions on a single risk basis 
coverage is usually triggered by a large loss sustained by an individual risk rather than by smaller losses which fall below the specified retention of the reinsurance contract 
we also write direct insurance and facultative reinsurance coverage on commercial property risks where we assume all or part of a risk under a single insurance contract 
we generally write such coverage on an excess of loss basis 
we also write property pro rata reinsurance contracts which are reinsurances of individual property risks written on a proportional basis rather than on an excess of loss basis 
property catastrophe these contracts are typically all risk in nature  providing protection against losses from earthquakes and hurricanes  as well as other natural and man made catastrophes such as floods  tornadoes  fires and storms 
the predominant exposures covered are losses stemming from property damage and business interruption coverage resulting from a covered peril 
certain risks  such as war  nuclear contamination and terrorism  are almost always excluded  partially or wholly  from our contracts 
property catastrophe reinsurance is written on an excess of loss basis  which provides coverage to primary insurance companies when aggregate claims and claims expenses from a single occurrence from a covered peril exceed a certain amount specified in a particular contract 
to a lesser extent  we also write retrocessional coverage contracts  which provide reinsurance protection to other reinsurers  also called retrocedants 
coverage generally provides catastrophe protection for the property portfolios of other reinsurers 
retrocessional contracts typically carry a higher degree of volatility than reinsurance contracts as they protect against concentrations of exposures written by retrocedants  which in turn may experience an aggregation of losses from a single catastrophic event 
other specialty reinsurance contracts of aviation liability  aviation war  marine  personal accident catastrophe  workers compensation  terrorism  other casualty and other reinsurance business are included in this category 
marine and aviation contracts are primarily written on a retrocessional excess of loss basis 
qualifying quota share qqs this category represents whole account quota share reinsurance to three lloyd s syndicates 
under qqs contracts  we assume a specified portion of the risk on a specified coverage in exchange for an equal proportion of the premiums 
gross premiums written related to qqs arrangements have been recorded gross of original commissions to the syndicates 
we did not write any qqs contracts in income from our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of interest on fixed maturity investments net of investment expenses  dividends received on our equity investments  and to a lesser extent from net realized gains on the sale of investments 
a significant portion of our contracts provide short tail reinsurance coverage for damages resulting mainly from natural and man made catastrophes  which means that we could become liable for a significant amount of losses on short notice 
accordingly  we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains shorter term fixed maturity investments with a modest portfolio of equity investments 

table of contents our expenses consist primarily of loss and loss adjustment expenses  acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses and interest costs related to our debt 
loss and loss adjustment expenses are a function of the amount and type of reinsurance and insurance contracts we write and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include a component for outstanding case reserves for claims which have been reported and a component for losses incurred but not reported 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process  together with the potential for unforeseen developments  may result in loss and loss adjustment expenses significantly greater or less than the reserve provided 
changes to our prior year loss reserves will impact our current underwriting results by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant or reducing our results if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient 
as new information becomes known to us  any resulting adjustments will be reflected in income in the period in which they become known 
our ability to estimate loss and loss adjustment expenses accurately at the time of pricing our contracts is a critical factor in determining our profitability 
since the classes of business we underwrite have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made catastrophes  we expect that our claims experience will predominantly be the result of relatively few events of significant severity 
the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in  and could have a material adverse effect on  our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to write new business 
acquisition costs consist principally of brokerage expenses and commissions which are driven by contract terms on the reinsurance and insurance contracts we write  and are normally a set percentage of premiums 
under certain contracts we may also pay profit commission to cedants which will vary depending on the loss experience on the contract 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of fixed expenses which include salaries and benefits  professional fees  office and risk management expenses  and variable expenses which include costs related to our performance unit plan  bonuses and stock option plan 
other than bonuses and performance units  expenses are primarily fixed in nature and do not vary with the amount of premiums written or losses incurred 
summary of critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported and disclosed amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our operations as their application requires management to make the most significant judgments 
other significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements are included in note to the december  consolidated financial statements included in this filing 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
for most insurance and reinsurance companies  the most significant judgment made by management is the estimation of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
we maintain loss and loss adjustment expense reserves to cover our estimated liability for both reported and unreported claims 
we utilize a reserving methodology that calculates a point estimate for our ultimate losses  and we then develop a range around our point estimate 
the point estimate represents management s best estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses 
our internal actuaries review our reserving assumptions and our methodologies on a quarterly basis and our loss estimates are subject to an annual corroborative review by independent actuaries using generally accepted actuarial principles 
the extent of reliance on management judgment in the reserving process differs as to whether the business is insurance or reinsurance and as to whether the business is written on an excess of loss or on a pro rata basis 
loss reserve calculations for insurance business are not precise in that they deal with the inherent uncertainty of future contingent events 
estimating loss reserves requires us to make assumptions regarding future reporting and development patterns  frequency and severity trends  claims settlement practices  potential changes in the legal environment and other factors such as inflation 

table of contents reserving for reinsurance business introduces further uncertainties 
as predominantly a broker market reinsurer for both excess of loss and proportional contracts  we must rely on loss information reported to brokers by primary insurers who must estimate their own losses at the policy level  often based on incomplete and changing information 
the information we receive varies by cedant and may include paid losses  estimated case reserves  and an estimated provision for incurred but not reported losses ibnr reserves 
additionally  reserving practices and the quality of data reporting may vary among ceding companies which adds further uncertainty to the estimation of our ultimate losses 
there is a time lag inherent in reporting from the original claimant to the primary insurer to the reinsurer especially in the case of excess of loss reinsurance contracts 
also  the combination of low claim frequency and high severity make the available data more volatile and less useful for predicting ultimate losses 
in the case of proportional contracts  we rely on an analysis of a contract s historical experience  industry information  and the professional judgment of underwriters in estimating reserves for these contracts 
in addition  if available  we also rely partially on ultimate loss ratio forecasts as reported by cedants  which are normally subject to a quarterly or six month lag 
as a result of the time lag described above  we must estimate ibnr reserves  which consist of a provision for additional development in excess of the case reserves reported by ceding companies  as well as a provision for claims which have occurred but which have not yet been reported to us by ceding companies 
because of the degree of reliance that we necessarily place on ceding companies for claims reporting  the associated time lag  the low frequency high severity nature of much of the business that we underwrite  and the varying reserving practices among ceding companies  our reserve estimates are highly dependent on management judgment and therefore uncertain 
estimating loss reserves for our small book of longer tail casualty reinsurance business  which can be either on an excess of loss or proportional basis  involves further uncertainties 
in addition to the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process described above  casualty business can be subject to much longer reporting lags than property business  and claims often take many years to settle 
during this period  additional factors and trends will be revealed and as these factors become apparent  reserves will be adjusted 
there is also the potential for the emergence of new classes of losses or types of losses within the casualty book 
any factors that extend the time until claims are settled add uncertainty to the reserving process 
at december   management has estimated gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to our casualty business of million 
since we rely on estimates of paid losses  case reserves  and ibnr provided by ceding companies in order to assist us in estimating our own loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  we maintain certain procedures in order to mitigate the risk that such information is incomplete or inaccurate 
at least monthly management assesses the reporting activities of these companies on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria 
on a timely basis management takes appropriate follow up action as required  which may include requests for supplemental information or analysis and  in certain cases  ceding company audits conducted by our own staff or by third parties as appropriate 
in our short history  disputes with ceding companies have been extremely rare and those which have not been resolved in negotiation have been resolved through arbitration in accordance with contractual provisions 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include both a component for outstanding case reserves for claims which have been reported and a component for ibnr reserves 
our case reserve estimates are initially set on the basis of loss reports received from third parties 
the majority of both our reinsurance and insurance business is sourced through brokers but a small proportion is sourced directly from the insured party or ceding company 
the reinsurance and insurance business which is sourced through brokers is subject to a potential time lag in the receipt of information which we factor into our reserving process as discussed above 
we are predominantly a reinsurance company specializing in short tail property reinsurance business  but we write a small proportion of longer tail casualty reinsurance business 
we also write a small book of direct insurance business  all of which is comprised of short tail property risks 
in general  claims relating to short tail property risks are reported more promptly by third parties than those relating to long tail risks  including the majority of casualty risks 
however  the timeliness of reporting can be affected by such factors as the nature of the event causing the loss  the location of the loss  and whether the losses 
table of contents are from policies in force with primary insurers or with reinsurers 
the claim count on the types of insurance and reinsurance that we write  which are low frequency and high severity in nature  is generally low 
the reporting delay for longer tail casualty business  which comprises a small proportion of our business  is traditionally longer than for our short tail lines 
because our casualty premiums written have been small relative to our property premiums written and because losses associated with such casualty premiums are substantially slower to develop than those associated with our property premiums  our volume of casualty claims has been significantly smaller than our volume of property claims to date 
due to these factors  we do not normally expect to experience significant claims processing back logs 
at december   we did not have a significant back log in either our insurance or reinsurance claims processing 
ibnr reserves are estimated by management using various actuarial methods as well as a combination of our own historical loss experience  historical insurance industry loss experience  our underwriters experience  estimates of pricing adequacy trends  and management s professional judgment 
in the case of our reinsurance business  we also take into account ceding company reports on ibnr reserves in making our estimates 
due to our relatively short operating history  our loss experience is limited and reliable evidence of changes in trends of numbers of claims incurred  average settlement amounts  numbers of claims outstanding and average losses per claim will necessarily take many years to develop 
in addition  due to the nature of the business  this information is not routinely provided by the cedants for every contract 
because of these factors  management supplements our own claims experience with other information in setting reserves 
for catastrophic events  we consider aggregate industry loss reports and catastrophe model projections in addition to ceding company estimates and other factors as described above 
for other classes  we utilize industry loss ratio and development pattern information in conjunction with our own experience 
to the extent we rely on industry data to aid us in our reserve estimates there is a risk that the data may not match our risk profile or that the industry s reserving practices overall differ from our own and our cedants 
in addition  reserving can prove especially difficult should a significant loss event take place near the end of an accounting period  particularly if it involves a catastrophic event 
these factors further contribute to the degree of uncertainty in the reserving process 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process  together with the potential for unforeseen developments  may result in loss and loss adjustment expenses significantly greater or less than the reserves provided 
changes to our prior year loss reserves will impact our current underwriting results by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant or reducing our results if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient 
we expect volatility in our results in periods that significant loss events occur because us gaap does not permit insurers or reinsurers to reserve for loss events until they have occurred and are expected to give rise to a claim 
as a result  we are not allowed to record contingency reserves to account for expected future losses 
we anticipate that claims arising from future events will require the establishment of substantial reserves from time to time 
management believes that the reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are sufficient to cover losses that fall within assumed coverages on the basis of the methodologies used to estimate those reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that actual losses will not exceed our total reserves 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates and the methodology of estimating such reserves are regularly reviewed and updated as new information becomes known to us 
any resulting adjustments are reflected in income in the period in which they become known 
management has determined that the best estimate for gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  was million 
of this estimate million relates to our insurance business and million relates to our reinsurance business 
management s best estimate of a range of likely outcomes around this estimate is between million and million 
for additional information concerning our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the following table sets forth a breakdown between case reserves and ibnr by line of business at december  in millions gross ibnr at gross case reserves at gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  december  december  property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share total premiums 
though we are principally a provider of reinsurance  we write both insurance and reinsurance contracts 
our insurance premium is all written on an excess of loss basis 
our assumed reinsurance premium is written on an excess of loss or on a pro rata basis 
reinsurance contracts are generally written prior to the time the underlying direct policies are written by cedants and accordingly they must estimate such premiums when purchasing reinsurance coverage 
for the majority of excess of loss contracts  including all insurance business  the deposit premium is defined in the contract wording 
the deposit premium is based on the ceding companies estimated premium  and this is the amount we record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept 
in the majority of cases  these contracts are adjustable at the end of the contract period to reflect the changes in underlying risks during the contract period 
subsequent adjustments  based on reports by the ceding companies of actual premium  are recorded in the period they are determined  which are normally reported within six months to a one year subsequent to the expiration of the policy 
to date these adjustments have not been significant 
on pro rata contracts and certain excess of loss contracts where the deposit premium is not specified in the contract  an estimate of written premium is recorded in the period in which the underlying risks incept 
the premium estimate is based on information provided by ceding companies 
at the inception of the contract the ceding company estimates how much premium they expect to write during the year 
as these are pro rata contracts  our gross written premium related to these contracts is a function of the amount of premium they estimate they will write 
when the actual premium is reported by the ceding company  which may be on a quarterly or six month lag  it may be significantly higher or lower than the estimate 
we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of these premium estimates based on the latest information available  which includes actual reported premium to date  the latest premium estimates as provided by cedants and brokers  historical experience  management s professional judgment  information obtained during the underwriting renewal process  as well as a continuing assessment of relevant economic conditions 
any adjustments to premium estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and may significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined 
the net income impact in of premium adjustments with respect to premiums estimated to have been earned in was immaterial 
we expect the net income impact in of premium adjustments with respect to premiums estimated to have been earned in to be immaterial 
where contract terms on excess of loss contracts require the reinstatement of coverage after a ceding company s loss  the mandatory reinstatement premiums are recorded as written premiums when the loss event occurs  and are recognized as earned premium ratably over the remaining contract period 
we accrue reinstatement premiums based on case reserves reported by ceding companies and on management s best estimate of ibnr reserves as described above under loss and loss adjustment expense reserves when the ibnr reserves can be identified on an individual contract basis 
generally pro rata contracts do not contain provisions for the reinstatement of coverage 
management includes an assessment of the creditworthiness of cedants in the review process above  primarily based on market knowledge  the timeliness of cedants past payments and the status of current balances owing 
in addition  management may also review the financial statements of ceding companies 
based on this 
table of contents assessment  management believes that as at december  no provision for doubtful accounts is necessary 
for excess of loss contracts  other than risk attaching contracts or contracts where the deposit premium is not defined  premium income is generally earned ratably over the term of the reinsurance contract  usually months 
for all other contracts  including contracts written on a pro rata or risks attaching basis  premiums are generally earned over a month period which is the risk period of the underlying month policies 
the portion of the premium related to the unexpired portion of the policy at the end of any reporting period is reflected on the balance sheet in unearned premium 
performance unit plan the pup 
the pup was the company s primary executive long term incentive scheme  until it was exhausted at december  pursuant to the terms of the pup  at the discretion of the compensation and nominating committee of the board of the directors the committee  performance units were granted to executive officers and certain other key employees 
performance units entitle the recipient to receive  without payment to the company  all  double  or a part of the value of the units granted  depending on the achievement of specific financial or operating goals 
performance units vest at the end of a three year performance cycle  and are payable in cash  common shares or a combination thereof at the discretion of the committee 
a total of  performance units were authorized under the pup at december  and or up to  common shares should the maximum harvest of of units apply covering the three performance periods   and we accrue the projected value of these units and expense the value in the income statement over the course of each three year performance period 
the accrual is based on the number of units granted  the share price at the end of the respective fiscal period end plus an adjustment for any dividends paid out during the performance period  and an initial assumption of a harvest ratio  unless otherwise adjusted as discussed below 
at the end of the sixth quarter  and every subsequent quarter  we reassess the projected results for each three year performance period and adjust the accrued pup liability as necessary 
we recalculate the liability under the pup as our financial results evolve and the share price changes  and reflect such adjustments in the income statement in the period in which they are determined 
this may result in an adjustment to the harvest ratio used in the liability calculation which may increase or decrease the amount of liability and expense recorded during the period 
for the cycle  the target combined ratio was for a harvest ratio 
the target for a maximum harvest of of the value of the units granted is a combined ratio of or less 
a combined ratio of or more would have resulted in a harvest of nil 
straight line interpolation is used between these points 
at december  the actual harvest ratio for this performance period was  compared to the estimated harvest ratio at december  of 
on february   we paid out the pup accrual of approximately million 
for the cycle  the performance target for a harvest ratio is the achievement of a combined ratio of over the period or the achievement of an annual total return to shareholders of as measured over the period 
to date we have experienced a combined ratio less than for this three year performance period 
taking into account our results to date as well as the estimated combined ratio for the remainder of this performance period  we have adjusted the estimated harvest ratio from at december  to at december  this resulted in an increase in the pup liability and pup expense during the year ended december  for the cycle  the performance target for a harvest ratio is the achievement of a combined ratio of over the period or the achievement of an annual total return to shareholders of as measured over the period 
consistent with our accounting policy  we are currently estimating the pup liability and pup expense using a harvest ratio and will reassess the harvest ratio used in the calculation of the pup liability at june  and each quarter thereafter 
as at december   the following table summarizes the impact of potential share price changes and potential adjustments to the harvest ratio used in the liability calculation on the amount of liability and expense recorded for the remaining three year cycles in thousands 
table of contents increase decrease in pup increase decrease in pup accrual resulting from a accrual resulting from a increase decrease in increase decrease in the estimated harvest pup performance period the share price ratio applied based on estimated harvest ratios applied at december  based on the share price of at december  an estimated change in the estimated combined ratio is approximately equivalent to a change in the harvest ratio for the respective performance period 
the compensation and nominating committee of the board of directors has approved a new long term incentive plan effective as of january  at the discretion of the committee  performance shares or other types of awards will be granted to executive officers and certain other key employees 
performance shares entitle the recipient to receive  without payment to the company  all  double  or a part of the value of the performance shares granted  depending on the achievement of specific financial or operating goals 
performance shares vest at the end of a three year performance cycle  and are payable in cash  common shares or a combination thereof at the discretion of the committee 
for the cycle the committee has adopted a return on allocated capital roac framework to assess management s performance 
outlook and trends generally speaking  pricing in property and other insurance and reinsurance markets has been cyclical in nature 
multi year periods of intense price competition and insufficient pricing soft market have been followed by periods of higher  sufficient pricing a hard market 
then  over a period of a few years  as lost capital is replenished  and new competitors enter the business  prices fall again 
a hard market has sometimes been precipitated by a large catastrophic event or series of events 
the terrorist events of september  occurred at the end of a long period of insufficient pricing  and additionally  it was a period where asbestos and other latent loss liabilities had significantly weakened the ability of some competitors to assume insurance risk 
for these reasons  adequately priced opportunities were widespread for the past few years 
in market loss terms  was the worst year ever for natural catastrophes 
at december  we estimated industry insured losses of approximately billion for the four us hurricanes and two large japanese typhoons that occurred during the third quarter of such catastrophic events had a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
while such events might have been expected to improve pricing in the future  due to the financial strength of the industry  we continue to see competition eroding the adequacy of rate levels in many of the classes of business  with commercial property insurance worldwide and non us property treaty renewals particularly impacted 
we expect that casualty reinsurance rates will remain relatively stable overall 
rate levels in other classes of business are expected to vary from stable to some rate reductions 
separately  we see the growth of a new class of competition in our markets 
hedge funds and catastrophe bonds are elements we now see more regularly as competition to traditional reinsurance markets 
in general  as it currently stands we estimate that our overall gross premiums written for will be lower by at least as compared to as a result of the above factors and perhaps more if as the year develops we find that we do not like the way market rates are trending 
see the gross premiums written discussion below for additional commentary 
we continue to believe that superior long term returns for shareholders will be driven by disciplined underwriting through the cycle 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and the decrease in net income for the year ended december  year compared to was principally driven by losses incurred related to the four major us hurricanes and two japanese typhoons which occurred during the third quarter of there were no loss events of a comparable magnitude in the same period in as at december  we estimated the overall negative impact on net income related to these catastrophes to be approximately million which is as a result of the increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses and related increase in reinstatement premium ceded  which was partially offset by reinstatement premium written and a reduction in profit commission and incentive compensation expenses 
other factors contributing to the decrease in net income as compared to the prior year are as follows a greater level of reinsurance premiums ceded  an increase in acquisition costs due to the increased level of proportional business written  an increase in financing expense due to a full year s interest expense on the senior notes  and an increase in general and administrative expenses due to increased professional fees and staffing costs 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned  favorable development of net losses from prior years of approximately million in compared to million in  and an increase in net investment income as a result of our higher investment portfolio balance 
the following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the years indicated in millions years ended december  net premiums earned net investment income net realized gains on investments net foreign exchange gains loss and loss adjustment expenses acquisition costs general and administrative expenses 
financing expense income tax expense net income basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share the following table summarizes our book values per common share as at the periods indicated as at december  book value per share fully converted book value per share based on total shareholders equity divided by basic shares outstanding 
fully converted book value per share is a non gaap measure  based on total shareholder s equity plus the assumed proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants of million for and million for and  divided by the sum of shares  options and warrants outstanding assuming their exercise of  for and  for and the company believes that fully converted book value per share more accurately reflects the value attributable to a common share 

table of contents we ended the year with a fully converted book value per share as defined above of  an increase of from december  this increase of mainly resulted from the net effect of the factors described above 
in addition  we paid a regular quarterly dividend of per quarter during the year 
we experienced a return of approximately on our investment portfolio including unrealized gains for the year ended december  as compared to a return of for the year ended december  total return to shareholders  which is a non gaap measure  was or for the year ended december  it is the internal rate of return of the increase in fully converted book value per share from at december  to at december   including the accrued dividends of for each of the four quarters of management believes that this measure most accurately reflects the return made by its shareholders as it takes into account the effect of all dilutive securities and the effect of dividends 
management believes that fully converted book value per share and total return to shareholders are measurements which are important to investors and other interested parties  and that these persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry 
however  these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry 
these measures may be incorporated into the formulae applied by our compensation and nominating committee when determining the harvest ratio under our performance unit plan 
gross premiums written details of gross premiums written by line of business are provided below in millions years ended december  property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share total during  we refined the classification of gross premiums written for certain pro rata contracts between the property specialty line and the property catastrophe and other specialty lines 
there was no effect on total gross premiums written 
for the year ended december   excluding the effects of million in reinstatement premiums recorded as a result of the third quarter catastrophes  gross premiums written were at a similar level to however  disregarding the qqs business  gross premiums written increased during the year ended december  compared to by approximately 
as expected  our mix of business changed in as always envisaged we did not renew the qqs programs in and increased the level of other specialty business  consisting mainly of increases in casualty business and other miscellaneous classes of business 
consistent with  for the three syndicates we did reinsure in and  we negotiated substantial other reinsurance contracts for to partially replace the reduction in qqs premium in and the non renewed qqs premium income in gross premiums written related to the property specialty category increased only marginally compared to the same period in mainly as a result of an increase in proportional business 
this increase was offset somewhat by the decreases in premium levels on direct and facultative business 
the property catastrophe category has shown a slight increase in gross premiums written during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in mainly due to an increase in reinstatement premiums written as a result of the catastrophes which occurred during the third quarter of offsetting this increase was a decrease due to the reduction in premium rate levels as discussed elsewhere 

table of contents the other specialty category strengthened as compared to the prior year  partly due to increased market penetration resulting mainly from our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and  we believe  due to the developing reputation of our underwriting and risk management skills 
this category has also increased due to increases in the level of our casualty business 
casualty business included professional indemnity casualty reinsurance  predominantly medical malpractice  specialized errors and omissions business  uk employer s liability and catastrophe and or clash layers for general liability and retrocessional accounts  on an excess of loss basis 
as previously stated  we wrote a larger amount of casualty reinsurance in as compared to due to improving terms and conditions of casualty reinsurance contracts 
for the years ended december  and  casualty accounted for approximately and of gross premiums written  respectively 
we estimate that casualty business will account for approximately of our gross premiums written during but this level could be affected by premium rate levels 
in addition  we have added a dedicated underwriter to focus on the sabotage and terrorism class and we have also entered into agreements with the overseas private investment corporation opic to form an insurance facility to underwrite stand alone terrorism insurance products 
we anticipate writing a modestly higher amount of this business in as compared to as expected  we did not write qqs business for the underwriting year and as a result the gross premiums written for this category decreased as compared to the same period in the qqs gross premiums written in related to adjustments in estimates made to the and underwriting years mainly as a result of the movement in foreign exchange rates 
we expect to commute all underwriting year contracts during the first or second quarter of the increase in gross premiums written in all classes of business  except qqs  from to resulted mainly from increased market penetration which allowed us to capitalize on market opportunities in virtually all lines of business 
in we also experienced increases in our written line sizes and in our average signing percentages 
premium rate levels were stable in as compared to across the major classes of business in which we specialize in but we experienced improved signings on renewals as well as increased access to more original programs than in our reputation  combined with our strong capital base and additional ratings also contributed to the increase in gross premiums written 
as expected  qqs gross premiums written accounted for less gross premiums written in than in part of the reduction related to reduced premiums for the and underwriting years as during the receipt of new information indicated that the expected premiums for the qqs business for both these underwriting years was going to be lower than previous forecasts 
the qqs results for both the and underwriting years are estimated on the basis of projections for the respective years supplied by the underlying syndicates  adjusted for actual reported results from the underlying syndicates 
the january renewal season saw increasing price deterioration and a reduced number of risks meeting our return criteria 
however  while we believe pricing remains adequate on the business we have renewed  we have declined a significant number of programs in all categories where we believe pricing was inadequate 
as a result  the january renewal season showed an initial reduction in our estimated premium income of approximately by comparison to the same time last year 
this will be reflected in our results for the first quarter of and is not necessarily indicative of our expectations of our level of gross premium income for as a whole 
the final number will depend significantly upon the outcome of the opportunities we see for the renewal of the japanese treaty accounts in april and the florida programs in june  and  of course  any significant loss activity during as it currently stands we estimate our overall gross premium income for will be lower by at least as compared to and perhaps more if as the year develops we find that we do not like the way the market rates are trending 
we continue to believe that superior long term returns for shareholders will be driven by disciplined underwriting through the cycle 
reinsurance premiums ceded year ended december  in millions reinsurance premiums ceded reinsurance premiums ceded for increased from primarily because we purchased additional protection against our catastrophe book as compared to the prior year 
in addition  in we also purchased protection for our casualty book and recorded reinstatement reinsurance premiums ceded of million related 
table of contents to the catastrophes which occurred during the third quarter of there was also a slight increase during in the amount of inuring reinsurance recorded as part of our reinsurance arrangements with certain ceding companies 
for both the and years we have purchased reinsurance protecting ourselves against large risk losses on our direct and facultative book and small to medium size catastrophes on our overall property writings 
excluding storm related reinsurance premiums ceded  we anticipate that reinsurance premiums ceded will rise slightly in for the year ended december   the majority of reinsurance premiums ceded related to retrocessional protection purchased on our own account and inuring reinsurance as part of our reinsurance arrangements with certain ceding companies 
the remainder related to reinsurance premiums ceded related to qqs business 
as we have not written any qqs business for the underwriting year  we have not recorded a material amount of reinsurance premiums ceded in related to this business 
reinsurance premiums ceded in solely related to the qqs syndicates with respect to the contracts in which we participate for the and underwriting years 
the lower level of qqs inuring reinsurance premiums ceded in as compared to is directly related to the level of qqs gross premiums written as discussed above 
net premiums earned years ended december  in millions net premiums earned net premiums earned increased in each of the three years ended december   and mainly due to the increase in premiums written for the majority of our lines of business in the current and prior year 
net premiums earned have also increased due to the acceleration of earned premiums related to certain policies affected by the catastrophes which occurred during the third quarter of we also earned a portion of the reinstatement premiums written and ceded related to the third quarter catastrophes 
offsetting these increases is a decrease in net earned premium as a result of the earning of the additional reinsurance purchased during the year 
net premiums earned increased by approximately million as result of the effect of the third quarter catastrophes 
net premiums earned are expected to decrease in due to the expected decline in gross and net premiums written during as discussed above 
loss and loss adjustment expenses the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are often measured by reference to its loss ratio and expense ratio 
the loss ratio is calculated by dividing loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred including estimates for incurred but not reported losses by net premiums earned 
the expense ratio is calculated by dividing acquisition costs combined with general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
for comparative purposes  our combined ratio and components thereof are set out below for the years indicated years ended december  loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio the nature of our business means that loss ratios can vary widely from period to period depending on the occurrence and severity of natural and man made catastrophes 
during the year ended december   we incurred estimated gross and net losses of million and million  respectively  from four us hurricanes  two japanese typhoons  and the tsunami which occurred in southeast asia in december 
table of contents catastrophe losses contributed significantly more to the loss ratio than in or for business less heavily impacted by catastrophes  the level of losses experienced has generally been lower than our long term expectations for the years ended december   and the variation in the loss ratios between the year ended december  and the prior year results from the fact that in we did not have the benefit of prior years loss history on which to base our loss reserve analysis and  accordingly  we relied more heavily on industry experience and professional judgment to estimate our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
as our business developed in  we supplemented industry information with our own specific experience in our actuarial analysis 
this led to reduced projections of ultimate losses  particularly in the property specialty classes of business 
net loss and loss adjustment expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
reinsurance recoveries of million  million and million were netted against loss and loss adjustment expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately of the reinsurance recoveries for relates to the hurricanes and typhoons which occurred during the third quarter 
the remainder relates to qqs business 
reinsurance recoveries for the years ended december  and related to qqs only 
based on additional information received from the syndicates  we reduced our estimated recovery ratio on reinsurance purchased by the qqs syndicates which resulted in the negative reinsurance recovery amount for the year ended december  we paid net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in paid losses during as compared to related to payments made for the hurricane losses as discussed above 
in addition  excluding the catastrophes  net paid losses have increased each year as our book of business has matured and we make claim payments related to multiple underwriting years 
we expect that our paid losses will be higher than average during the first six months of as we continue to pay claims related to the catastrophes 
at december  approximately of our gross reserves related to the third quarter catastrophes 
the following are our net loss ratios by line of business for the periods indicated years ended december  property specialty property catastrophe qualifying quota share other specialty overall ratio the overall gross loss ratio for the year ended december  was the overall gross loss ratio for the year ended december  was the overall gross loss ratio for the year ended december  was the property catastrophe and property specialty groups of business contained the lines most impacted by the aforementioned catastrophes 
excluding the seven major catastrophic events  the net loss ratios for the year ended december  for both the property catastrophe and property specialty groups of business were lower in than in primarily because there were relatively few other property loss events which impacted us during the year 
in the same period in  we incurred losses from hurricanes fabian and isabel as well as the wildfires which occurred in california 
the catastrophes which occurred during were of a much greater magnitude than those which occurred during the loss ratios for the property catastrophe and property specialty groups have also benefited from favorable prior year development 
the other specialty class continues to experience very low levels of reported losses  but has also been impacted to some extent by the catastrophes which occurred during the third quarter of  resulting in a higher net loss ratio for as compared to the same period in there is also a higher percentage of casualty business in the other specialty group in compared with these classes have been reserved at higher loss ratios due to the longer tail nature of casualty business 
the qualifying quota share loss ratio for the year ended december  is lower than the same period in this is as a result of the qqs syndicates lowering their ultimate loss 
table of contents ratio projections for both the and the underwriting years 
the third quarter catastrophes are expected to have minimal impact on the qqs business since these contracts were not renewed for the underwriting year 
the following tables set forth a reconciliation of our gross and net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by line of business for the year ended december  in millions gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves estimated ultimate change in losses gross prior years for the gross reserves at estimates paid losses year at reserves at december  during during december  december  property specialty property catastrophe qualifying quota share other specialty total net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves estimated ultimate change in losses net prior years for the net reserves at estimates paid losses year at reserves at december  during during december  december  property specialty property catastrophe qualifying quota share other specialty total the and years include approximately million and million  respectively  of favorable development of net losses from prior years 
favorable prior year development benefited the net loss ratio for the years ended december  and by approximately and  respectively 
the favorable development during the year ended december  of losses incurred during prior accident years primarily resulted from the following in the property specialty category  both the frequency and severity of reported losses have been lower than the assumed reporting pattern of losses established for this class of business at december  many of the proportional contracts have continued to have little or no reported loss activity on the and accident years 
reported losses on and occurrences for our property facultative book of business decreased by million during the year ended december  as these years develop  we place more weight in the reserving process on the actual loss experience compared with the initial loss ratio expectation 
the low level of reported losses for and and the increasing weight on the actual experience have led to the reduction in the ultimate loss projection of million during property catastrophe net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as at december   included reserves for several major catastrophic events from and the largest of these were the european floods of august  hurricane isabel which occurred in september  and the october 
table of contents wildfires in california 
claims from these three events have developed less than our initial projections indicated  leading to a reduction in net ultimate losses of million during the lack of development in the year ended december   combined with the increasing weight placed on our actual experience in selecting a loss ratio  led to a decrease in our projected loss ratio attributable to the other specialty business during claim frequency has been very low for these classes of business 
in addition  we have given more weight to the actual loss experience compared to the initial expected loss ratios in our reserving process  resulting in reduced projections for and the lower selected loss ratios have resulted in a reduction of million in net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for our other specialty business 
due to the potential variability in ultimate premiums and the limited availability of underlying loss information with the qqs business  our actuaries selected an expected loss ratio based on a review of the information supplied by cedants and applied it to projected premiums 
during the year ended december   we reduced our expected gross loss ratio based on information provided by ceding companies  which resulted in a reduction of million in gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
this was largely due to decreases in the loss ratio estimates provided by the syndicates 
taking into account the effect of reinsurance purchased by the qqs syndicates with respect to the contracts in which we participate  our net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves decreased by million for the year ended december  the development of ultimate loss ratios for the and underwriting years on qqs contracts continue to improve and we expect to commute the qqs contracts during the first quarter of other than the matters described above  we did not make any significant changes in the assumptions or methodology used in our reserving process during the year ended december  at december   we estimated our gross and net reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses using the methodology as outlined in our critical accounting policy earlier in this section 
management has determined that the best estimate for gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december   and was million  million and million  respectively

table of contents net foreign exchange gains net foreign exchange gains result from the effect of the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities combined with realized gains losses resulting from the receipt of premium installments and payment of claims in foreign currencies 
the foreign exchange gain during the years ended december   and is primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar resulting in gains on translation arising out of receipts of foreign currency premium installments 
our premiums receivable and liabilities for losses incurred in currencies other than the us dollar are exposed to the risk of changes in value resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and may affect our financial results in the future 
underwriting expenses years ended december  in millions acquisition costs including profit commission general and administrative expenses expense ratio including profit commission expense ratio excluding profit commission acquisition costs are generally driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of fixed expenses  which include salaries and benefits  share options and office and risk management expenses  and variable expenses which include costs related to our performance unit plan and bonuses 
acquisition costs as a percentage of gross premiums earned  excluding reinsurance and profit commission  were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the ratio is broadly similar to the and ratios 
we anticipate that the acquisition cost ratio  excluding profit commission  will remain at a similar level in as in although the amount may vary due to the mix of business written and estimated loss experience 
profit commission expensed was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
profit commission has declined substantially as compared to the same period in mainly due to the increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to the third quarter of catastrophes 
the accrual for profit commission increased in as compared to as a result of favorable loss experience 
profit commission will fluctuate as our estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves fluctuates 
general and administrative expenses for the years indicated consisted of the following in millions years ended december  fixed expenses  excluding share options current and deferred incentive compensation fair value of share options expense total general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses from to is partially as a result of an increase in fixed expenses for professional fees and employment costs  consistent with the increase in staff numbers in in addition  there was an increase in the accrual for current and deferred incentive compensation expense but not as much as originally anticipated as our net income decreased due to the catastrophes which occurred during the third quarter of for the year ended december   the performance unit plan pup expense included in current and deferred incentive compensation was higher than the same period in as a result of a combination of factors 
the factors that affect the calculation of the pup expense in consist of a decrease in the harvest ratio used in calculating the expense for the performance period from at december  to at december  this reduction resulted mainly from the effect of the third quarter of catastrophes  the effect of which was partially offset by an increase in our share price which includes an adjustment for any dividends paid out during the performance period from to for the 
table of contents period  the expense increased in due to the increase in the harvest ratio from at the end of to at december   combined with the increase in our share price which includes an adjustment for any dividends paid out during the performance period  from to the year also includes an additional accrual for the performance period 
the overall effect was a net increase in the pup expense as compared to on february  we paid out the pup accrual of approximately million 
the current and deferred incentive compensation expense was higher in as compared to as the year included an accrual for both the and the performance periods as well as the fact that the share price at december  was significantly higher than at december  as our results evolve  we may need to increase or decrease our harvest ratio used in the expense calculation which could either reduce or increase the pup expense 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expense ratio will increase during as we expect our general and administrative expenses to be at a similar level to but anticipate that our earned premium will decline as discussed above in the gross premiums written section 
the fair value of share options expense has decreased from to as a portion of the outstanding share options became fully vested and expensed 
net investment income years ended december  in millions net investment income net investment income was primarily composed of interest on coupon paying bonds and bank interest  partially offset by accretion of premium on bonds and investment management and custodian fees of million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the investment management fees were paid to white mountains advisors llc  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of white mountains insurance group  one of our major shareholders 
management believes that the fees charged were consistent with those that would have been charged by an unrelated party 
the investment management and custodian fees are lower for as compared to even though the asset base has increased because the investment management fee structure was revised during the first quarter of  resulting in a lower expense for our current portfolio mix 
the fees increased from to due to the increase in our asset base 
the fees will vary as our mix of investments changes 
because we provide short tail insurance and reinsurance coverage for losses resulting mainly from natural and man made catastrophes  we could become liable to pay substantial claims on short notice 
accordingly  we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains shorter term fixed maturity investments  such as us government and agency bonds  us government sponsored enterprises  corporate debt securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
based on the weighted average monthly investments held  and including net unrealized gains of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  the total investment return was   and  respectively 
in  as expected  our investment income has increased as a result of our larger investment portfolio  but has been offset somewhat by the higher level of paid claims during the year related to the catastrophes that occurred during the third quarter of net paid claims were million in as compared to million in during we expect to pay substantial additional claims related to the catastrophes and  as such  the portfolio may shrink which may lead to minimal growth or a reduction in net investment income for in addition  the level of the investment portfolio and related investment income will be affected by the special dividend we declared on february  of approximately million  any catastrophes which could occur during and by other capital management initiatives enacted

table of contents unrealized losses of million at december   investments with a market value of million have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than months 
of the gross unrealized losses of million at december   no investment had continuously been in an unrealized loss position for more than months 
we believe that the gross unrealized losses relating to our fixed maturity investments at december  of million resulted primarily from increases in market interest rates from the dates that certain investments within that portfolio were acquired as opposed to fundamental changes in the credit quality of the issuers of such securities 
therefore  these decreases in value are viewed as being temporary because we have the intent and ability to retain such investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we also believe that the gross unrealized losses relating to our equity portfolio of million at december  are temporary based on an analysis of various factors including the time period during which the individual investments has been in an unrealized loss position and the significance of the decline 
the performance results of our fixed maturity portfolio  with a comparison to the lehman brothers government credit year index combined with the month treasury bill rate  for the year ended december  was as follows lehman brothers montpelier re gov t credit year index performance holdings ltd 
month t bill total return total return is calculated by dividing total net investment income on fixed maturity investments by the monthly average of the sum of such investments at amortized cost in the combination of the lehman brothers government credit year index and the month treasury bill rate is used for comparative purposes as it closely reflects our asset mix

there were no letters of credit issued under this facility at december  we expect these letter of credit facilities to be sufficient to support montpelier re s estimated obligations for the next months in the absence of a very major catastrophe 
the letter of credit facility agreements contain covenants that limit our and montpelier re s ability  among other things  to grant liens on their assets  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
the letter of credit facility agreements also require us to maintain specific financial ratios and montpelier re to maintain certain credit ratings 
if we or montpelier re fails to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios  the lenders could declare a default and begin exercising remedies against the collateral  montpelier re would not be able to request the issuance of additional letters of credit and we would not be able to borrow under the revolving line of credit

montpelier re is registered under the insurance act bermuda  amendments thereto and related regulations the act 
under the act  montpelier re is required annually to prepare and file statutory financial statements and a statutory financial return 
the act also requires montpelier re to meet minimum solvency requirements

accordingly  we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains shorter term fixed maturity investments  such as us government and agency bonds  us government sponsored corporate debt securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the market value of our portfolio of fixed maturity investments at december  comprises us government securities  non us government securities  us government sponsored enterprises securities  corporate debt securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
all of the fixed maturity investments we currently hold were publicly traded at december  based on the weighted average monthly investments held  and including net unrealized gains  our total return on investments for the year ended december  was 
this return was partially due to the unrealized gain on our investment in aspen at december  of million 
the average duration of our invested asset portfolio was years and the average rating of the portfolio was aa at december  if the right

we have an investment in the common shares of aspen insurance holdings limited aspen  a bermuda based holding company of aspen insurance uk limited aspen re 
at december   we owned million shares of aspen  which represented approximately of aspen on an undiluted basis 
aspen completed their initial public offering on december  our investment in aspen is carried at quoted market value at december  at december  the shareholders agreement and other restrictions presented significant obstacles and uncertainties in the determination of the number of shares that could be reasonably expected to qualify for sale within one year 
as a result of this illiquidity  at december  a portion of the total investment was considered restricted and was discounted 
the aggregate unrealized gain is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
on february   the company sold million of its aspen shares at per common share for total proceeds of million  realizing a gain of million 
the company currently owns million shares  or approximately of aspen 
on august   the company invested an aggregate of million as part of an investor group acquiring the life and investments business of safeco corporation since renamed symetra financial corporation  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement 
symetra is an unquoted investment and is carried at estimated fair value based on reported net asset values and other information available to management  with any unrealized gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
cash flows in the year ended december   we generated an operating net cash inflow of million  primarily relating to premiums net of acquisition costs received by montpelier re 
we paid net losses of million during the year ended december  we invested a net amount of million during the year ended december   and had a cash balance of million at december  the increase in liquidity has resulted from premiums received that were higher than the level of paid claims during the year 
our liquidity depends on operating  investing and financing cash flows as described below 
our sources of funds primarily consist of the receipt of premiums written  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
cash is used primarily to pay loss and loss adjustment expenses  brokerage commissions  general and administrative expenses  to purchase new investments  to pay dividends  to pay for any premiums retroceded and future authorized share repurchases 
in we purchased retrocessional excess of loss protection against large risk losses on the direct insurance and facultative book and against small to medium size catastrophes on our overall property writings 
in addition  in we also purchased retrocessional stop loss protection against losses on our casualty writings 
for we expect to purchase a slightly higher amount of reinsurance protection as compared to our cash flows from operations represent the difference between premiums collected and investment earnings realized  and the loss and loss adjustment expenses  underwriting and other expenses paid and investment losses realized 
cash flows from operations may differ substantially  however  from net income 
to date  we have invested the majority of our cash flows not required for operating purposes but have also paid out dividends to our shareholders and repurchased common shares during as discussed above 
we have written certain business that has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity 
this may result in volatility in both our results of operations and operational cash flows 
the potential for a large claim under one of our insurance or reinsurance contracts means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time 
as a result  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
we intend to manage these risks by structuring our investments in an effort to anticipate the payout patterns of our liabilities under insurance or reinsurance policies 
no assurance can be given  however  that we will successfully match the structure of montpelier re s investments with its liabilities under insurance or reinsurance contracts 
if our calculations with respect to these reinsurance liabilities are incorrect  or if we improperly structure our investments to match such liabilities  we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity  
table of contents potentially at a significant loss 
the estimated fair value of fixed maturity  equity  other investments and our cash and cash equivalents balance was  million as of december   compared to  million at december  the primary cause of this increase was the receipt of million in premiums net of acquisition costs  net investment income of million and net realized gains on investments of million for the year ended december   offset by paid claims  the payment of general and administrative expenses  the payment of dividends and the repurchase of some of our common shares 
for the period from inception until december   we have had sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our liquidity requirements 
we have generated cash flows from operations since our inception significantly in excess of our operating commitments 
to the extent that capital is not utilized in our reinsurance operations we have used such capital to invest in new opportunities and returned additional capital to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases under certain circumstances 
as announced on february   we will return approximately million of capital to shareholders and warrant holders by way of a special dividend to be paid on march  to shareholders of record as of march  we may take similar measures in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and credit risk 
the company has in place a derivatives use plan 
however it has not entered into any derivative contracts to date 
interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
our fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of montpelier re s reinsurance liabilities 
as of december   an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio of or approximately million and the impact on our portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as of december   the impact on our portfolio from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in market value of or approximately million and the impact on our portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as of december   we held million  or of our total invested assets  in mortgage related securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  which occurs when holders of individual mortgages increase the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and refinance at a lower interest rate cost 
given the proportion that these securities comprise of the overall portfolio  and the current low interest rate environment  prepayment risk is not considered significant at this time 
as of december   we held million  or of our total invested assets  in mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
foreign currency risk 
a significant portion of our business is reinsuring or insuring risks  receiving premiums and paying losses in currencies other than the us dollar 
we also maintain a small portion of our investment portfolio in investments in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to fluctuations in the rates of these currencies 
in the event of a significant loss event which requires settlement in a currency other than the united states dollar  we may use forward foreign currency exchange contracts in an effort to hedge against movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar 
a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 

table of contents foreign currency exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
we do not expect to enter into such contracts with respect to a material amount of our assets 
at december  and  we did not have any outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
the british pound is the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiary  montpelier marketing services uk limited mmsl 
accordingly  mmsl s assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of mmsl are translated at average exchange rates during the period 
the effect of translation adjustments at the end of the period is not included in our consolidated results of operations but is included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
on a consolidated basis  mmsl does not generate material revenue and expenses and  therefore  the effects of changes in exchange rates during the period are not material 
our premiums receivable and liabilities for losses incurred in foreign currencies are exposed to the risk of changes in value resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and may affect our financial results in the future 
credit risk 
we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed maturity investments 
in accordance with our investment guidelines as approved by our board of directors  our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
all of our fixed maturity investments were publicly traded at december  and were investment grade 
all of our fixed maturity investments were publicly traded and were all investment grade at december  effects of inflation the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
we take into account the anticipated effects on us in our catastrophe loss models 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses we cannot know the precise effects of inflation on our results until claims are ultimately settled 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates
