quarterly results set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements item of this annual report on form k is selected income statement data for the eight quarters ended september  we derived this information from unaudited quarterly financial statements that include  in the opinion of our management  all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for such periods 
you should read this information in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our revenue and operating results are subject to significant variation from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contracts  the revenue earned on contracts  the timing of revenue on license sales  the timing of revenue on performance based contracts  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of government agencies for awarding contracts  and the term of each contract that we have been awarded 
because a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
further  we have occasionally experienced a pattern in our results of operations pursuant to which we incur greater operating expenses during the start up and early stages of significant contracts prior to receiving related revenue 
our quarterly results may fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
business combinations and acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire complementary businesses to expand our geographic reach and the breadth and depth of our services and to enhance our customer base 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have completed the following business acquisitions name date description of business segment tiecorp

other working capital changes providing cash were increases in other assets of million and increases in other liabilities of million 
the increase in accounts payable reflected increases resulting from new or expanded projects as well as normal fluctuations in payment cycles 
management expects that the favorable effect on cash flows of the increased accounts payable may be reversed in subsequent periods due to the timing of payments

non cash items consisted of million of depreciation and amortization  million from the income tax benefit of option exercises  million from deferred income tax benefits  and million non cash equity based compensation

in addition  in june  the board of directors authorized the use of option exercise proceeds for the repurchase of our common stock 
during the years ended september  and  we repurchased  and  shares  respectively 
at september   approximately million remained available for future stock repurchases under the program 
our working capital at september  and was and million  respectively 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million and no debt  except for lease obligations 
management believes this strong liquidity and financial position will allow us to continue our stock repurchase program  depending on the price of the company s common stock  and to pursue selective acquisitions 
restricted cash represents amounts collected on behalf of certain customers and its use is restricted to the purposes specified under our contracts with these customers 
under the provisions of certain long term contracts  we may incur certain reimbursable transition period costs 
during the transition period  these expenditures resulted in the use of our cash and in our entering into lease financing arrangements for a portion of the costs 
reimbursement of these costs may occur in the set up phase or over the contract operating period 
related revenue may also be deferred during the set up phase 
as of september   approximately million in net costs had been incurred and reported as deferred contract costs on our september  consolidated balance sheet 
also under the provisions of one long term contract  we issued a standby letter of credit in the initial amount of up to million  which amount was reduced to million on april  the letter of credit  which expires on march   may be called by a customer in the event we default under the terms of the contract 
the facility contains financial covenants that establish minimum levels of tangible net worth and earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda and requires the maintenance of certain cash balances 
we were in compliance with the covenants at september  in july  we entered into a capital lease financing arrangement with a financial institution whereby we acquired assets pursuant to an equipment lease agreement 
rental payments for assets leased are payable over a month period at a rate of commencing in january in march  we entered into a supplemental capital lease financing arrangement with the same financial institution whereby we acquired additional assets pursuant to an equipment lease agreement 
rental payments for assets leased under the supplemental arrangement are payable over a month period at a rate of commencing in april at september   capital lease obligations of approximately million were outstanding related to these lease arrangements for new equipment 
at september  and  we classified accounts receivable of approximately million and million  respectively  net of a million and million discount  respectively  as long term receivables and reported them within the other assets category on our consolidated balance sheets 
these receivables have extended payment terms and collection is expected to exceed one year 
on october   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of for each share of the company s common stock outstanding 
the dividend was payable on november  to shareholders of record on november  based on the number of shares outstanding at november   the payment was approximately million 
we believe that we will have sufficient resources to meet our currently anticipated capital expenditure and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
effects of inflation approximately of our business is conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which adjust revenue to cover costs increased by inflation 
approximately of the business is time and material contracts where labor rates are often fixed for several years 
we generally have been able to price these contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
the remaining portions of our contracts are fixed price and performance based and are typically priced to account for the likely inflation from period to period to mitigate the risk of our business being adversely affected by inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts  the realizability of goodwill  and amounts related to income taxes  certain accrued liabilities and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that we do not have significant off balance sheet risk or exposure to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
while we have significant operating lease commitments for office space  those commitments are generally tied to the period of performance under related contracts 
additionally  although on certain contracts we are bound by performance bond commitments and standby letters of credit  we have not had any defaults resulting in draws on performance bonds or letters of credit 
also  we do not speculate in derivative transactions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
in fiscal  approximately of our total revenue was derived from state and local government agencies  from federal government agencies  from foreign customers  and from other sources  such as commercial customers 
revenue is generated from contracts with various pricing arrangements  including fixed price  performance based criteria  costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost plus  and time and materials 
also  some contracts contain not to exceed provisions 
for fiscal  revenue from fixed price contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from performance based contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from cost plus contracts was approximately of total revenue  and revenue from time and materials contracts was approximately of total revenue 
a majority of the contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed price and performance based  and our contracts with the federal government generally have been cost plus 
fixed price and performance based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts 
we recognize revenue on fixed priced contracts when earned  as services are provided 
for certain fixed price contracts  primarily systems design  development and implementation  we recognize revenue based on costs incurred using estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs to be incurred 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and costs is recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
for other fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
with fixed price contracts  we are subject to the risk of potential cost overruns 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are provided in full in the period in which such losses become known 
we recognize revenue on performance based contracts as such revenue becomes fixed or determinable  which generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers 
for certain contracts  this may result in revenue being recognized in irregular increments 
additionally  costs related to contracts may be incurred in periods prior to recognizing revenue 
these costs are generally expensed 
however  certain direct and incremental set up costs may be deferred until services are provided and revenue begins to be recognized  when such costs are recoverable from a contractual arrangement 
set up costs are costs related to activities that enable us to provide contractual services to a client 
these factors may result in irregular revenue and profit margins 
revenue on cost plus contracts is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate of the negotiated fee earned 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized based on hours worked and expenses incurred 
our most significant expense is cost of revenue  which consists primarily of project related costs such as employee salaries and benefits  subcontractors  computer equipment and travel expenses 
our management uses its judgment and experience to estimate cost of revenue expected on projects 
our management s ability to accurately predict personnel requirements  salaries and other costs as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our fixed price  performance based and time and materials contracts 
if actual costs are higher than our management s estimates  profitability may be adversely affected 
service cost variability has little impact on cost plus arrangements because allowable costs are reimbursed by the customer 
we also license software under license agreements 
license fee revenue is recognized when a non cancelable license agreement is in force  the product has been delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
in addition  when software license contracts contain post contract customer support as part of a multiple element arrangement  revenue is recognized based upon the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element 
maintenance and post contract customer support revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements  which in most cases is one year 
revenue from software related consulting services under time and material contracts and for training is recognized as services are performed 
revenue from other software related contract services requiring significant modification or customization of software is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  requires contracts with multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
while eitf has not had a material impact on our financial statements  we apply the guidance therein and recognize revenue on multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting if the criteria are met 
impairment of goodwill 
we adhere to the financial accounting standards board s statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
under these rules  goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with fas and fas goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
annual impairment tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of our reporting units with which goodwill is associated 
losses  if any  resulting from annual impairment tests will be reflected in operating income in our income statement 
capitalized software development costs 
capitalized software development costs are capitalized in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize both purchased software that is ready for resale and costs incurred internally for software development projects from the time technological feasibility is established 
capitalized software development costs are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value 
upon the general release of the software to customers  capitalized software development costs for the products are amortized based on the straight line method of amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  which ranges from three to five years 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment for recoverability of capitalized development costs require considerable judgment by management including  but not limited to  technological feasibility  anticipated future gross revenues  estimated economic life  and changes in software and hardware technologies 
any changes to these estimates could impact the amount of amortization expense and the amount recognized as capitalized software development costs in the consolidated balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
on a regular basis we re evaluate our client receivables  especially receivables that are past due  and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues 
if our clients were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
deferred contract costs 
deferred contract costs consist of recoverable direct and incremental set up costs relating to long term service contracts 
these costs include system development and facility build out costs that are expensed ratably as services are provided under the contracts 
income taxes 
to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of income tax expense to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our tax returns  revision to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  changes in the geographic mix of our business  the actual level of pre tax income  changes in tax rules  regulations and rates  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
we may also establish tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not fully succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts  such as the progress of a tax audit  new case law  or expiration of a statute of limitations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposure to market risk related to the effect of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices with regard to instruments entered into for trading or for other purposes is immaterial
