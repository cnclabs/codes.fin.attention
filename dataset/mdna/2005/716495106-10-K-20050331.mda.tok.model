item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
regulations domestic exploration for  and production and sale of  natural gas and oil are extensively regulated at both the federal and state levels 
legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion  frequently increasing the regulatory burden 
also  numerous departments and agencies  both federal and state  are authorized by statute to issue  and have issued  rules and regulations binding on the natural gas and oil industry that often are costly to comply with and that carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
in addition  production operations are affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  constantly changing administrative regulations and possible interruptions or termination by government authorities 
state regulatory authorities have established rules and regulations requiring permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
most states in which we operate also have statutes and regulations governing a number of environmental and conservation matters  including the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells 
many states also restrict production to the market demand for natural gas and oil 
such statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which natural gas and oil and could otherwise be produced from our properties 
we are subject to extensive and evolving environmental laws and regulations 
these regulations are administered by the united states environmental protection agency and various other federal  state  and local environmental  zoning  health and safety agencies  many of which periodically examine our operations to monitor compliance with such laws and regulations 
these regulations govern the release of waste materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  human  animal and plant health  and affect our operations and costs 
in recent years  environmental regulations have taken a cradle to grave approach to waste management  regulating and creating liabilities for the waste at its inception to final disposition 
our natural gas and oil exploration  development and production operations are subject to numerous environmental programs  some of which include solid and hazardous waste management  water protection  air emission controls and situs controls affecting wetlands  coastal operations and antiquities 
environmental programs typically regulate the permitting  construction and operations of a facility 
many factors  including public perception  can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit 
once operational  enforcement measures can include significant civil penalties for regulatory violations regardless of intent 
under appropriate circumstances  an administrative agency can request a cease and desist order to terminate operations 
new programs and changes in existing programs are anticipated  some of which include natural occurring radioactive materials  natural gas and oil exploration and production waste management and underground injection of waste materials 
each state in which we operate has laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal  water and air pollution 
many states also have regulations governing oil and gas exploration  development and production operations 
we are also subject to federal and state hazard communications and community right to know statutes and regulations 
these regulations govern record keeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances 
we believe we are in compliance with these requirements in all material respects 
we may be required in the future to make substantial outlays to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the additional changes in operating procedures and expenditures required to comply with future laws dealing with the protection of the environment cannot be predicted 
employees as of december   we employed full time employees 
we hire independent contractors on an as needed basis 
we have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees 
we believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory

risk factors natural gas and crude oil prices are volatile  and low prices could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  profitability and future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on prevailing natural gas and crude oil prices 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
 the amount we will be able to borrow under our revolving credit facility will be subject to periodic redetermination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can economically produce and have an adverse effect on the value of our properties 
prices for natural gas and crude oil have continued to remain high over the past twelve months 
historically  the markets for natural gas and crude oil have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
among the factors that can cause volatility the domestic and foreign supply of natural gas and crude oil  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and other producing countries to agree upon and maintain crude oil prices and production levels  political instability  armed conflict and terrorist attacks  whether or not in natural gas and crude oil producing regions  the level of consumer product demand  the growth of consumer product demand in emerging markets  suc h as china  labor unrest in natural gas and oil producing regions  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the price of foreign imports  worldwide economic conditions  and the availability of liquid natural gas imports 
these external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of natural gas and crude oil 
in general  the volume of production from natural gas and crude oil properties declines as reserves are depleted 
our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful development and exploration activities 
our future natural gas and crude oil production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
however  we cannot assure you that our future acquisition  development and exploration activities will result in any specific amount of additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requir es an assessment of a number of factors 
these factors include recoverable reserves  future natural gas and crude oil prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities  title issues and other factors 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with such assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe is thorough 
however  there is no assurance that such a review will reveal all existing or potential problems or allow us to fully assess the deficiencies and capabilities of such properties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties at acceptable prices because the competition for producing natural gas and crude oil properties is particularly intense at this time and many of our competitors have financial and other resources which are substantially greater than those available to us 
our bank lenders can limit our borrowing capabilities  which may materially impact our operations 
as of december   our total debt was million and we had approximately million of cash and additional available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
the borrowing base limitation under our revolving credit facility is semi annually redetermined 
redeterminations are based upon a number of factors  including commodity prices and reserve levels 
the next redetermination date is expected to occur in may upon a redetermination  we could be required to repay a portion of our bank debt 
we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments  which could result in a default under the terms of the loan agreement and an acceleration of the loan 
we intend to finance our development  acquisition and exploration activities with cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and other financing activities 
in addition  we may significantly alter our capitalization in order to make future acquisitions or develop our properties 
these changes in capitalization may significantly increase our level of debt 
if we incur additional debt for these or other purposes  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
a higher level of debt also increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance which is affected by general economic conditions and other financial and business factors 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
our level of debt affects our operations in several important ways  including the following a portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt limit our ability to borrow additional funds  pay dividends  dispose of assets or issue shares of preferred stock and otherwise may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisition  general corporate or other purposes  a leveraged financial position would make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures  and any debt that we incur under our revolving credit facility will be at variable rates which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
our ability to finance our business activities will require us to generate substantial cash flow 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves through our drilling or acquisition activities 
our business activities require substantial capital 
 we have budgeted total capital expenditures in of approximately million 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures in the future through cash flows from operations  the incurrence of additional indebtedness and or the issuance of additional equity securities 
we cannot be sure that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
future cash flows and the availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables  such as the level of production from existing wells  prices of natural gas and crude oil  our results in locating and producing new reserves  the success and timing of development of proved undeveloped reserves  and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt  we may have to obtain additional financing through the issuance of financial securities 
we cannot be sure that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
issuing equity securities to satisfy our financing requirements could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
the level of our debt financing could also materially affect our operations 
if our revenues were to decrease due to lower natural gas and crude oil prices  decreased production or other reasons  and if we could not obtain capital through our revolving credit facility or otherwise  our ability to execute our development and acquisiti on plans  replace our reserves or maintain production levels could be greatly limited 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves through our drilling or acquisition activities 
in general  the volume of production from natural gas and crude oil properties declines as reserves are depleted 
our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful development and exploration activities 
our future natural gas and crude oil production is highly dependent up on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
however  we cannot assure you that our future acquisition  development and exploration activities will result in any specific amount of additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of a number of factors 
these factors include recoverable reserves  future natural gas and crude oil prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities  title issues and other factors 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with such assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe is thorough 
 however  there is no assurance that such a review will reveal all existing or potential problems or allow us to fully assess the deficiencies and capabilities of such properties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties at acceptable prices because the competition for producing natural gas and crude oil properties is particularly intense at this time and many of our competitors have financial and other resources which are substantially greater than those available to us 
drilling wells is speculative  often involves significant costs and may not result in additions to our production or reserves 
developing and exploring for natural gas and crude oil reserves involves a high degree of operating and financial risk 
the actual costs of drilling  completing and operating wells often exceeds our budget for such costs and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise due to a tightening in the supply of various types of oilfield equipment and related services 
drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons  including title problems  weather  cost overruns  equipment shortages  mechanical difficulties  and faulty assumptions about geological features 
moreover  the drilling of a productive natural gas and crude oil well does not ensure a profitable investment 
exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells 
a variety of factors  including geological and market related factors  can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economic 
in addition to their cost  unsuccessful wells can hurt our efforts to replace reserves 
estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise and any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates will materially affect the quantities and the value of our reserves 
our estimates of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to natural gas and crude oil prices  drilling and operat ing expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating natural gas and crude oil reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and crude oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and crude oil reserves will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and the value of our reserves 
our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by o ther operators on adjacent properties 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and crude oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain than estimates of developed reserves 
recovery of undeveloped reserves required significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of these natural gas and crude oil reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves in accordance with sec regulations  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs or estimated reserves are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated 
in addition  you should not construe our estimate of standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves included in the supplemental oil and gas information as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
we have based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserve on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  in accordance with applicable sec regulations  whereas actual future prices and costs may be significantly higher or lower 
many factors will affect future net cash flow  including nb sp  prices of natural gas and crude oil  the amount and timing of actual production  the cost  timing and success in developing proved undeveloped reserves  supply and demand for natural gas and crude oil   curtailments or increases in consumption by natural gas and crude oil purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of the production of natural gas and crude oil properties and of the related expense a ffect the timing of actual future net cash flow from proved reserves and  thus  their actual value 
in addition  the discount factor used is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the natural gas and crude oil industry in general are subject 
we depend on the skill  ability and decisions of third party operators to a significant extent 
we operate approximately of our working interest estimated proved reserves 
the success of the drilling  development and production of the natural gas and crude oil properties in which we have or expect to have a non operating working interest is substantially dependent upon the decisions of such third party operators and their diligence to comply with various laws  rules and regulations affecting such properties 
the failure of any third party operator to perform the following in a proper manner with respect to properties in which we have an interest could result in material adverse consequences to our interest in such properties  including substantial penalties and compliance costs make decisions  perform their services  discharge their obligations  deal with regulatory agencies  and comply with laws  rules and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
such adverse consequences could result in substantial liabilities to us or reduce the value of our properties  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
we depend substantially on the continued presence of key personnel for critical management decision and industry contacts 
our management team changed significantly with the acquisition of control by phawk in may we have six new directors  all new management  and many new technical personnel 
our future performance will be substantially dependent on retaining key members of this group 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our employees 
our business is highly competitive 
the natural gas and crude oil industry is highly competitive in many respects  including identification of attractive natural gas and crude oil properties for acquisition  exploration and development  securing financing for such activities and obtaining the necessary equipment and personnel to conduct such operations and activities 
in seeking suitable opportunities  we compete with a number of other companies  including large natural gas and crude oil companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources and  in some cases  with more expertise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with these entities 
hedging transactions may limit our potential gains 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our natural gas and crude oil production  we have entered into natural gas and crude oil price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
we will most likely enter into additional hedging transactions in the future 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile natural gas and crude oil prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if natural gas and crude oil prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  or the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts 
our natural gas and crude oil activities are subject to various risks which are beyond our control 
our operations are subject to many risks and hazards incident to exploring and drilling for  producing  transporting  marketing and selling natural gas and crude oil 
although we may take precautionary measures  many of these risks and hazards are beyond our control and unavoidable under the circumstances 
many of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses  the ability of certain of our wells to produce natural gas and crude oil in commercial quantities  the rate of production and the economics of the development of  and our investment in  the prospects in which we have or will acquire an interest 
any of these risks and hazards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
such risks and hazards include human error  accidents  labor force and other factors beyond our control that may cause personal injuries or death to persons and destruction or damage to equipment and facilities  blowouts  fires  pollution and equipment failures that may result in damage to or destruction of wells  producing formations  production facilities and equipment  unavailability of materials and equipment  engineering and construction delays  unanticipated transportation costs and delays  unfavorable weather conditions  hazards resulting from unusual or unexpected geological or environmental conditions  environmental regulations and requirements  accidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials  such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment  changes in laws and regulations  including laws and regulations applicable to natural gas and crude oil activities or markets for the natural gas and crude oil produced  fluctuations in supply and demand for oil and gas causing variations of the prices we receive for our natural gas and crude oil production  and the internal and political decisions of opec and natural gas and crude oil producing nations and their impact upon natural gas and crude oil prices 
as a result of these risks  expenditures  quantities and rates of production  revenues and cash operating costs may be materially adversely affected and may differ materially from those anticipated by us 
governmental and environmental regulations could adversely affect our business 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations on taxation  the exploration for and development  production and marketing of natural gas and crude oil and safety matters 
many laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells  rates of production  prevention of waste  unitization and pooling of properties and other matters 
these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning our natural gas and crude oil wells and other facilities 
in addition  these laws and regulations and any others that are passed by the jurisdictions where we have production  could limit the total number of wells drilled or the allowable production from successful wells  which could limit our revenues 
our operations are also subject to complex environmental laws and regulations adopted by the various jurisdictions in which we have natural gas and crude oil operations 
we could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of natural gas  crude oil  or other pollutants into the air  soil or water  including responsibility for remedial costs 
we could potentially discharge these materials into the environment in any of the following ways from a well or drilling equipment at a drill site  from gathering systems  pipelines  transportation facilities and storage tanks  damage to oil and natural gas wells resulting from accidents during normal operations  and blowouts  hurricanes  cratering and explosions 
because the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed  we cannot assure you that laws and regulations enacted in the future  including changes to existing laws and regulations  will not adversely affect our business 
in addition  because we acquire interests in properties that have been operated in the past by others  we may be liable for environmental damage caused by the former operators 
we cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses which may be sustained in connection with all oil and gas activities 
we maintain general and excess liability policies  which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards 
these policies generally cover personal injury  bodily injury  third party property damage  medical expenses  legal defense costs  pollution in some cases  well blowouts in some cases  and workers compensation 
there can be no assurance that this insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover every claim made against us in the future 
a loss in connection with our natural gas and crude oil properties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation to the extent that the insurance coverage provided under our policies cover only a portion of any such loss 
title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects 
we generally obtain title opinions on properties that we drill or acquire 
however  there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or failure 
generally  under the terms of the operating agreements affecting our properties  any monetary loss is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property 
if there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest  we will suffer a financial loss 
we have not paid  and do not anticipate paying  any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we do not expect to declare or pay any cash or other dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock 
holders of our series a preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the annual rate of per share when and as declared by our board of directors 
no dividends may be paid on our common stock unless all cumulative dividends due on all of our series a preferred stock have been declared and paid 
our existing revolving credit facility restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on our preferred stock and common stock  and we may also enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that restrict our ability to declare cash dividends on our preferred stock and common stock 
item properties a description of our properties is included in item business and is incorporated herein by reference 
we believe that we have satisfactory title to the properties owned and used in our business  subject to liens for taxes not yet payable  liens incident to minor encumbrances  liens for credit arrangements and easements and restrictions that do not materially detract from the value of these properties  our interests in these properties  or the use of these properties in our business 
we believe that our properties are adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business in the future

statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
overview petrohawk energy corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  development  production and exploration of natural gas and crude oil 
our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbons resources  which are conducive to multi well  repeatable drilling programs 
we have increased our proved reserves and production principally through acquisitions 
we focus on properties within our core operating areas that have a significant proved reserve component and which management believes have additional development and exploration opportunities 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  which are impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and crude oil prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
at december   our estimated total proved oil and gas reserves were billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent bcfe  consisting of billion cubic feet of natural gas and million barrels of crude oil 
proved reserves are approximately natural gas on an equivalent basis and approximately were classified as proved developed 
year end prices used to determine proved reserves were per mmbtu of gas and per barrel of crude oil 
we have assembled an experienced management team and technical staff with significant experience and expertise in property acquisitions  development and divestments  reservoir engineering  production operations  exploration and financial management 
most of the members of this team have worked together for several years with other companies 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and other financial resources will provide us with the ability to fully develop our existing properties  to finance our current exploration projects and to pursue new acquisition opportunities 
capital resources and liquidity our primary source of cash in was from funds obtained from financing activities 
proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and series b preferred securities was offset by cash used in investing activities as the company completed the acquisition of certain oil and gas properties from wynn crosby as well as the acquisition of phawk  llc 
in addition to these funds  the company generated cash flows from the sale of natural gas and crude oil 
operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
prices for natural gas and crude have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout the recent years 
working capital is substantially influenced by these variables 
fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures 
see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures 
see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 
year ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased million from this increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices and an increase in overall sales volumes in conjunction with the acquisitions discussed above in average realized prices increased from mcfe in to mcfe in production volumes increased from  mmcfe to  mmcfe 
we expect production to increase  but we are unable to predict future commodity prices 
as a result  we cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased million from this increase was primarily due to a increase in the average equivalent price per mcfe 
investing activities 
the primary driver of cash used in investing activities is capital spending  inclusive of acquisitions 
we establish the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices 
due to the volatility of commodity prices  our budget may be periodically adjusted during any given year 
cash used in investing activities in increased million from to this increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of wynn crosby of approximately million  as well as the acquisition of certain natural gas and oil properties from phawk  llc for approximately million 
the remaining increase from prior year was due to an increase in overall capital spending and exploration costs of approximately million 
in  we drilled gross wells compared to in cash flows used in investing activities decreased from to due to a decrease in capital expenditures offset by a decrease in proceeds from sales of certain properties 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million compared to a use of million in net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily driven by the following long term debt issuances in connection with the acquisition of wynn crosby  we entered into a new revolving credit facility with bnp paribas as the lead bank that is due in november the revolving credit facility has an initial borrowing base of million and a threshold amount of million 
at december   million is outstanding  a second lien facility in the amount of million was also provided by bnp paribas and a group of lenders that is due february  at december   million is outstanding  and in connection with the recapitalization of the company by phawk  llc  we issued a million five year unsecured subordinated convertible note payable to phawk  llc 
the company also received net proceeds of approximately million for the issuance of  share of series b automatically convertible preferred stock in the proceeds from this offering and the related financing transactions discussed above were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of wynn crosby 
these cash receipts were offset by the repayment of long term debt of million  including approximately million for the repayment outstanding long term debt of wynn crosby assumed in the closing of the transaction as well as the repayment of approximately million of long term debt upon the closing of the recapitalization of the company in during  we paid million in dividends on our series a preferred securities 
management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings  if necessary  our capital requirements  including acquisitions 
contractual obligations we have no material long term commitments associated with our capital expenditure plans or operating agreements 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
our level of capital expenditures will vary in future periods depending on the success we experience in our acquisition  developmental and exploration activities  gas and oil price conditions and other related economic factors

off balance sheet arrangements at december  and december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
plan of operation for on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations and  when necessary  our revolving credit facility 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
we have budgeted million in capital expenditures for critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
we discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee 
see results of operations above and note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
oil and gas activities accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using period end prices and costs and a discount rate 
full cost method we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into the cost centers the amortization base that are established on a country by country basis 
such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs and delay rentals 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties  plus an estimate of our future development and abandonment costs  are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
proved oil and gas reserves our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
in  all of the company s reserves  except bcfe related to royalty interest properties  were prepared by netherland  sewell associates  inc  an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm 
additionally  in  the company did not have a significant reserve revision recorded
