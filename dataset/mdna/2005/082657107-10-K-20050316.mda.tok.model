item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in order to speed approvals within european union countries  the european union has established a mutual recognition procedure 
when a manufacturer submits a pharmaceutical product for marketing approval  it must designate whether the filing will serve as a reference authorization for other european union countries and  if so  which specific european countries 
if the filing is not designated as a mutual recognition reference filing  then other applications must be made individually to other countries for approval to be granted in those other countries 
if the filing is designated as a reference authorization  then the authority in the initial country is required to evaluate the submission on the basis of its own domestic standards as well as the standards of each of the countries listed by the manufacturer 
as the standards for pharmaceutical approvals have not been harmonized among the various european union members  certain aspects of the filing must comply with standards that vary by country 
in addition  the process for initial evaluation of mutual recognition filings is generally significantly longer than that for national filings and  as a result  companies often choose not to use this process for their first approval 
however  if the filing is approved for the reference and the mutual recognition countries  the manufacturer would be permitted to market the product in all of the jurisdictions selected 
a manufacturing facility is required to obtain a general permit to operate a pharmaceutical business certifying that its facilities comply with european gmps 
these permits are granted by the national authorities in the country of manufacture and other european countries rely on regulation by the authority of the country of manufacture 
trends in healthcare regulation the cost of healthcare continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies  legislative bodies and private organizations 
many countries  in europe and elsewhere  directly or indirectly through reimbursement limitations  control the selling prices and reimbursement prices of certain healthcare products 
for example  in spain  prices for prescription pharmaceutical products must be approved by spain s ministry of health 
in order to help control rising healthcare costs  the ministry of health  in recent years  has encouraged the substitution of generic equivalent products 
in further efforts to reduce healthcare costs  the ministry of health had been contemplating new laws and regulations that would significantly reduce the market prices of certain pharmaceutical products  including generic equivalent drugs 
in late october  the spanish government enacted a regulation that reduced the prices that the government reimburses for certain prescription pharmaceutical products 
these new prices became effective on december   but were voluntarily implemented by some companies  including our spanish subsidiaries  on december  as a result  certain of our selling prices for these products have been reduced 
the regulation affected six of our chemical entities sold in spain  including the chemical entities omeprazole  simvastatin and enalapril  and reduced our revenues by approximately  million 
in  the spanish government temporarily suspended the reference price system that was implemented by the spanish government in late and proposed a point plan to replace the reference price system 
the new plan includes a price reduction in and an additional reduction in on only those drugs that have been on the market in spain for over one year and were not already subject to the reference price reductions for see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the government in spain or in other countries will not implement additional price reductions in the future 
in spain and in certain other european countries  there are regulations that prohibit a pharmacy from substituting another product if a doctor s prescription has specified a specific product for that patient 
recently  there has been intense scrutiny of pharmacists to assure that they are complying with this regulation 
other european countries permit the pharmacist to substitute products more freely than spain 
any change in this regulation may negatively affect our sales in spain  as our products are often prescribed by brand name by the physicians 
in western europe  efforts are under way by the european union to harmonize technical standards for many products  including drugs  to make more uniform the requirements for marketing approval from the various regulatory agencies 
in the united states  most states have enacted generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a generic version of a prescribed innovator drug 
federal and state governments continue their efforts to reduce costs of subsidized healthcare programs  including restrictions on amounts agencies will reimburse for the use of products 
efforts to reduce healthcare costs are also being made in the private sector 
healthcare providers have responded by instituting various cost reduction and containment measures of their own 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we or the healthcare industry in general might be affected by these changes 
continuing reviews of the utilization  safety and efficacy of healthcare products and their components are being conducted by industry  government agencies and others 
these studies  which employ increasingly sophisticated methods and techniques  can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted  and may in the future result  in the discontinuance of such products and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 
similar consequences can arise as a result of adverse events  which can impact both innovator and generic versions of the same drug 
we maintain product liability insurance for such potential claims  however  no such claims have ever been asserted against us 
other regulations we believe that we comply with environmental laws that apply to us and we do not anticipate that continuing compliance will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
item properties we own a  square foot commercial building situated on approximately acres of land in exeter  new hampshire that serves as our corporate headquarters and research and development laboratory 
it is located approximately minutes north of boston  massachusetts 
we also own a  square foot facility in zaragoza  spain  which accommodates our pharmaceutical products manufacturing plant  warehouse  research and development laboratory and office space 
we purchased a  square foot active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturing facility in zaragoza  spain in april and subsequently purchased adjacent parcels of land totaling approximately acres for expansion of our active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturing operation 
the api manufacturing facility is located in an industrial park and we have acquired sufficient acreage adjacent thereto to accommodate future expansion 
we lease a  square foot facility in san sebastian de los reyes  spain  an area northwest of madrid  which houses the administrative offices for our spanish and european operations 
the lease for this facility expires in we believe that each of our facilities has sufficient space for our current needs and our contemplated expansion in the near future 
our manufacturing facilities are currently operating at approximately of capacity  if operating for two shifts per day  five days per week 
item legal proceedings on february   we were notified that a legal proceeding had been commenced against us by merck co 
inc and its spanish subsidiary  merck sharp dohme de espa a  sa  alleging that we violated their patents in our production of simvastatin products and requested an injunction ordering us not to manufacture or market the products 
the case was brought against our spanish subsidiaries in the th first instance court of the city of madrid 
after a hearing on february   the court refused to grant the requested injunction and dismissed the case on february   awarding court costs and legal fees to us 
merck has appealed the award of fees 
merck re instituted its claim against us in another proceeding brought in the th first instance court of the city of madrid  of which we received notice on january  this case also alleged violation of merck s patents in the production of simvastatin products  requested an order that we cease manufacturing the products and demanded damages during the period of manufacture 
after a trial with respect to this matter held on february and   the court  on april   ruled in our favor  again awarding us court costs and legal fees 
merck has subsequently appealed this ruling 
on january   we were notified that a legal proceeding had been commenced against us by smith kline beecham plc  smith kline beecham  sa and glaxosmithkline sa alleging that we violate their patents in our production of paroxetine products and they requested an order requiring us to not manufacture or market the products 
the case was brought against our spanish subsidiaries in the th first instance court of the city of madrid 
this proceeding followed a preliminary injunction that the same plaintiffs attempted to bring against us in  which was dismissed 
we filed a response to this suit in february that included a counterclaim requesting that the court declare the asserted patent invalid 
we intend to vigorously oppose this claim as we believe the claim is without merit 
our paroxetine product line was launched in in september  a legal action was filed against us in the us district court of the district of delaware by ethypharm sa  a french based drug delivery company  primarily claiming misappropriation of unspecified alleged trade secrets in connection with the manufacture of omeprazole since march by laboratorios belmac  one of our spanish subsidiaries 
a related claim was previously brought against laboratorios belmac in the nd first instance court of the city of madrid requesting an injunction  which remains unresolved 
we intend to vigorously defend against the claims in the us and laboratorios belmac is doing the same in the spanish proceeding 
we are a party to various other legal actions that arose in the ordinary course of business 
we do not expect that resolution of these matters will have  individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on development  licensing and sales of generic and branded pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals for others in spain  other parts of europe and international markets  including the us market  and research  development and licensing commercialization of advanced proprietary drug delivery technologies for new and existing pharmaceutical products 
branded and generic pharmaceuticals our pharmaceutical product sales activities are based in spain  where we have a significant commercial presence and we manufacture and market approximately pharmaceutical products 
these products represent various dosage strengths and product formulations of more than chemical entities in four primary therapeutic areas cardiovascular  gastrointestinal  neurological and infectious diseases 
in approximately of our product revenues were derived from two of our product lines 
we market our branded and generic products to physicians  pharmacists and hospitals through our three separate sales and marketing organizations based in spain laboratorios belmac  laboratorios davur and laboratorios rimafar 
as prices for prescription pharmaceuticals have been lowered in spain by action of the ministry of health  which has authority to approve pharmaceutical prices  we are working to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations to reduce our costs  while also increasing sales 
we have recently focused on increasing our sales in other european countries and other geographic regions through strategic alliances with distributors in these territories 
we also target markets that offer compatible regulatory approval regimes and attractive product margins 
we also expect to grow our business by acquiring additional products to sell through our organization and our strategic alliances 
we continually acquire rights to new products in response to increasing market demand for generic and branded therapeutic products and  when appropriate  we divest products that we consider to be redundant or that have become non strategic 
for example  in november  we entered into a multi product collaboration agreement with perrigo company  the largest us manufacturer of over the counter pharmaceutical and nutritional products for the store brand market  to co develop and market in the us and potentially other markets selected generic pharmaceutical products that we produce in spain 
we also manufacture pharmaceuticals for other drug companies 
in april  we purchased a manufacturing facility located in spain that specializes in the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients 
the facility has been approved by the fda for the manufacture of one ingredient for marketing and sale in the us we are manufacturing and marketing these ingredients through our subsidiary  bentley api 
in addition  our spanish pharmaceutical product manufacturing facility produces pharmaceutical products that are marketed by other pharmaceutical companies both in spain and in other international markets 
proprietary drug delivery technologies and products we develop products that incorporate our drug delivery technologies that we have developed in the united states 
we have licensed applications of our proprietary cpe drug delivery technology to auxilium pharmaceuticals  inc  which launched testim the first product incorporating our cpe drug delivery technology  in the united states in february testim is a gel indicated for testosterone replacement therapy 
in testim was launched in germany and received marketing authorizations in two additional european countries  bringing the total number of countries in which testim is approved outside the us to we are also in discussions with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to form additional strategic alliances to facilitate the development and commercialization of other products using our drug delivery technologies  including product candidates that deliver insulin to diabetic patients intranasally and to treat nail fungus infections topically 
consolidated results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues increase in thousands revenues net product sales    licensing and collaboration revenues    total revenues    total revenues for the year ended december  increased from the year ended december  however  our total revenues increased approximately when expressed in constant currency 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  had the effect of increasing revenues by approximately  partially offsetting the impact of price reductions in spain 
sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients from our new manufacturing facility included in all other products in the table below added  to our consolidated revenues in the advancement of our proprietary drug delivery programs in the us  evidenced by the growing royalty stream from sales of testim  and other licensing revenues  increased our revenues by approximately  when compared to the prior year 
our revenues are generated through our primary sales channels of branded pharmaceuticals  generic pharmaceuticals  sales to licensees and others and licensing and collaboration revenues 
the following is a summary of our revenues by sales channel and top selling product lines for the year ended december  in thousands revenues within spain product line branded products generic products other revenues outside of spain total of total revenues omeprazole    simvastatin    enalapril    paroxetine    codeisan   all other products     sales to licensees and others    licensing and collaborations   total revenues      of revenues for the year ended december  in thousands revenues within spain product line branded products generic products other revenues outside of spain total of total revenues omeprazole    simvastatin    enalapril    paroxetine codeisan   all other products    sales to licensees and others    licensing and collaborations   total revenues      of revenues spanish operations 
the core of our spanish operations has been the efficient manufacturing and domestic marketing of branded and generic pharmaceutical products 
historically  our pharmaceutical products were sold only within spain 
however  the execution of our long term strategic plan has created an opportunity for our spanish operations to expand beyond the borders of spain and into other european countries and other countries outside of europe 
the increase in net product sales for the year ended december  over the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average value of the euro in relation to the us dollar  increased sales outside of spain  increased sales of our paroxetine product line  which was initially launched in may  and increases in sales of other generic products  such as trimetazedine  pentoxifylline and increases in sales to licensees and others 
our paroxetine product line generated net sales of  representing of our total revenues during and of our total growth in these increases helped to offset or lessen the impact of price reductions in spain  which are discussed below 
our revenues from our omeprazole products in declined to of our total revenues  compared to in the prior year  due to reduced selling prices in spain 
prices for prescription pharmaceutical products in spain must be approved by the ministry of health 
for several years  the ministry of health has encouraged the substitution of generic equivalent products in order to help control rising healthcare costs 
in late october  the spanish government enacted a regulation that reduced the prices that the government reimburses for nine of our chemical entities  including the chemical entities omeprazole  simvastatin and enalapril  which accounted for approximately two thirds of revenues in the year ended december  we implemented these new prices on december  although the law required laboratories to begin selling at the new prices in december  pharmacies in spain were able to continue to sell at the old higher prices until january  this transition period was an attempt to reduce returns of the higher priced products by allowing the higher priced products to pass through the distribution channel to the end users 
on average  our customers maintain a stock of approximately one to two months supply of our products 
as we began selling at the new lower prices on december  we expected the majority of our products that were labeled at the old higher prices to have cleared the distribution channel by january  we experienced an unforeseen level of returns totaling approximately  in these product returns exceeded our allowance for estimated sales returns at that time 
a majority of the products returned were either expired  nearing expiration or otherwise not resalable and consequently were destroyed 
the reduced selling prices resulted in a reduction in total revenues of approximately  in consequently our gross margins on pharmaceutical net product sales were negatively impacted  resulting in a decline in our gross margins from in to in in response to the risk of government mandated price reductions  we implemented several initiatives which have effectively reduced our production costs on several of our products and increased our gross margins 
these initiatives include the purchase of new high speed manufacturing equipment  new product launches  and increased sales volume and market share through strategic pricing 
we expect to continue to increase our future sales volume through our pipeline of approximately products 
additionally  in april  we purchased a manufacturing facility  located in zaragoza  spain  which specializes in the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients 
the ability to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients has diversified our revenue base 
we will continue to focus on acquiring  developing and launching new products that will improve our product mix 
we will also continue our efforts to increase our sales outside of spain through additional registration  marketing  and supply agreements 
we will also continue to make significant investments in renovating and increasing capacity in our manufacturing facilities  as well as continued investments in new high speed  high volume equipment 
we anticipate that our gross margins will gradually increase as we continue to implement our strategy and benefit from economies of scale 
branded pharmaceutical products change in thousands branded product sales enalapril   codeisan   omeprazole    mio relax   simvastatin   all other branded products    total branded sales   sales of our branded pharmaceutical products decreased in by approximately when expressed in constant currency 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  had the effect of increasing branded product sales by approximately  resulting in a decrease in branded pharmaceutical sales in the year ended december  when expressed in us dollars 
branded sales accounted for of total revenues during  compared to of total revenues during price reductions that took effect in december continued to negatively impact our branded product sales during most significantly  sales of our branded omeprazole decreased by approximately  from the prior year  as a result of the price reductions  although sales increased during the year in terms of number of units sold 
sales of our branded enalapril  which experienced a increase in unit volume compared to the prior year  increased from the prior year in spite of price cuts  and now accounts for of our branded product sales 
strong sales of our cough and cold medicine  codeisan  and the launch of our branded version of paroxetine in may also helped to mitigate the impact of the price reductions 
generic pharmaceutical products change in thousands generic product sales omeprazole   simvastatin   paroxetine   pentoxifylline   trimetazidine   all other generic products    total generic sales    sales of our generic pharmaceutical products increased in terms of units sold  but decreased by approximately in when expressed in constant currency

our generic paroxetine  which was launched in may  added approximately  to our generic sales in  when compared to  positioning it third behind our generic omeprazole and simvastatin products 
sales of our generic trimetazidine increased by approximately  in  or approximately from  while sales of our generic pentoxifylline increased by  or approximately 
sales to licensees and others increase in thousands sales to licensees and others    in addition to manufacturing and selling products our own branded and generic products  we license the right to market products to others within and outside of spain 
these license agreements are usually accompanied by long term exclusive supply agreements  whereby our licensees purchase the licensed products from our manufacturing facility 
as of december   our spanish operations have executed license agreements  of which with customers in spain and with customers outside of spain  cover actively marketed products that are generating revenues 
the remaining licenses  four with customers in spain and with customers outside of spain  are for products that are awaiting regulatory approvals 
additionally  we have contract manufacturing agreements in effect in spain and contract manufacturing agreements in effect for international customers 
our clients market these products under their own name and with their own labeling 
many of the products we manufacture for others use the same active ingredients that are used in our own marketed products 
sales under these agreements increased by  in constant currency  over the prior year 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  had the effect of increasing our revenues from sales to licensees and others by approximately  licensing and collaboration revenues 
licensing and collaboration revenues now account for of total revenues and increased by approximately  or approximately  in these revenues include royalties totaling  from the commercialization and continued sales of testim  the first product incorporating our cpe drug delivery technology  which was launched by our licensee  auxilium  in february testim is currently reported to capture approximately of all new testosterone replacement prescriptions in the market

selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net product sales decreased to in  compared to of net product sales in general and administrative expenses increase in thousands general and administrative    general and administrative expenses for increased over the prior year 
the  increase was the result of increased general and administrative activities required to support our continued growth and prepare for our anticipated growth in the future 
these expenditures include increased costs in the current year for additional employees  outside services  insurance and other costs to support the growth of our organization and costs associated with our response to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of general and administrative expenses would have been approximately  lower  absent the increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar

an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  had the effect of increasing research and development expenses by approximately  representing of the increase when expressed in us dollars 
in the first quarter of  we completed and reported the results of a phase i intranasal insulin trial 
our phase i trial demonstrated the effective delivery of insulin intranasally in healthy human subjects 
we have recently completed the in patient stage of a phase ii study of our clinical program for the intranasal delivery of insulin and are in the data analysis and reporting stages of that study 
additionally  we initiated certain clinical programs to support our strategy for the eventual distribution of certain of our spanish generic pharmaceutical products in other countries  including the us in order to further our strategy  we entered into a multi product collaboration agreement with perrigo company to co develop and market certain generic pharmaceutical products in the us and potentially other markets 
we expect to continue to incur costs to conduct clinical trials and support the required regulatory submissions for our clinical programs 
we also incur costs related to pre clinical programs for product formulation and testing efforts being performed in the laboratory in our us headquarters and at our facilities in spain 
the expenditures in research and development reflect our focus on projects that are necessary for expansion of our portfolio of marketed products and clinical trials involving our drug delivery technologies 
although some of our cost estimates are preliminary  and the specific timing is not known  we project that our research and development expenses in could be approximately  higher than in the year ended december  other income expenses change in thousands other income expenses   not meaningful other income expenses for the year ended december  increased by  over the same period in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to the reversal of previously accrued tax assessments totaling  partially offset by interest and penalties totaling  associated with the settlement of the tax audit of our spanish subsidiary see provision for income taxes during the second quarter of we recorded a pre tax benefit totaling   after taxes as a component of other income expenses as the result of the reversal of previously accrued pharmaceutical tax assessments in spain 
these assessments had been accrued to be paid to the spanish government to help reduce the impact of the rising health care costs in spain 
due to recent changes in the pharmaceutical industry in spain and a change in the spanish political environment  the basis for these liabilities no longer exists

in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution

we have also recognized revenues totaling  during the year ended december   related to product licensing activities in europe  which we have included in the consolidated income statements as licensing and collaboration revenues 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by approximately from approximately  or of the increase  is due to the increase in net product sales and slightly improved gross margins in and  or of the increase  is due to the increased licensing and collaboration revenues in the current year 
our gross margins on net product sales in increased slightly to compared to in as a result of economies of scale allocation of fixed costs over a larger number of units  reducing the per unit cost  partially offset by lower margins of generic products  which typically have lower prices  and the sales of certain of our products in the month of december at reduced selling prices

due to changes in the pharmaceutical industry in spain and a change in the spanish political environment  these liabilities no longer exist 
accordingly  these accruals were reversed during the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources total assets increased from  at december  to  at december   while stockholders equity increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in stockholders equity reflects primarily net income of  the positive impact of the fluctuation of the euro us dollar exchange rate which totaled  and the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants totaling  working capital increased from  at december  to  at december   primarily as a result of proceeds from exercises of options and warrants totaling  and profits during the year ended december  these amounts were partially offset by additions to fixed assets and the purchase of active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing assets  as well as investments in drug licenses

the weighted average interest rate on our short term borrowings is 
long term debt  which totaled  at december   decreased to  during the year ended december   as a result of classifying  the amount due within one year  as current portion of long term debt 
this decrease was partially offset by imputed interest on interest free loans in spain and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the weighted average interest rate including imputed interest on our long term debt is 
contractual obligations in addition to our short term borrowings and long term debt  we have fixed contractual obligations under various lease agreements 
our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years years in thousands long term debt  including imputed interest of capital leases operating leases   purchase obligations   other long term liabilities   total contractual cash obligations    included in purchase obligations are contractual obligations for the purchase of machinery  construction and engineering services and a new inventory management software application 
the construction and engineering services and new inventory management software application are associated with the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in zaragoza  spain 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above as our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time frame 
we do not have agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services including payroll  information technology and maintenance  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation at will  without significant penalty 
other long term liabilities represents other long term liabilities as reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  excluding long term deferred income of approximately  and long term debt and related imputed interest of approximately  these amounts are primarily tax payments due to the spanish ministry of taxes from the sale of certain drug licenses in prior years 
not included in the chart above are key executive compensation agreements that have been renewed whereby the company is currently obligated to pay approximately  to its key executives in such agreements renew annually unless terminated by any of the parties 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for obligations 
amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided net cash of  investing activities  primarily additions to machinery and equipment and capital improvements made to the manufacturing facility in spain  the purchase of active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturing assets and additions to drug licenses used net cash of  during the year ended december  financing activities  consisting primarily of the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants approximately  and proceeds from net borrowings approximately  provided net cash of  during the year ended december  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement whereby we granted to auxilium an exclusive royalty based worldwide license  to develop  market and sell a topical testosterone gel containing our cpe technology  we have been earning and receiving royalty payments from auxilium on testim sales since the product launch in early and we expect to continue receiving royalty payments for the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue making improvements to our manufacturing facilities during that include the acquisition of additional manufacturing equipment and expansion of our active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturing facility  in order to accommodate our expected growth 
we have budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures during we plan to finance these expenditures from a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings 
seasonality  effect of inflation and liquidity 
in the past  we have experienced lower sales in the third calendar quarter and higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to seasonality of our pharmaceutical business 
as we market more pharmaceutical products whose sales are seasonal  seasonality of sales may become more significant 
neither inflation nor changing prices has materially impacted our revenues or income from operations for the periods presented 
we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twenty four months 
we continue to search both domestically and internationally for opportunities that will enable us to continue expanding our business and explore alternative financing sources for these activities  including the possibility of public and or private offerings of our securities 
in appropriate situations  that will be strategically determined  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contribution by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development  testing  manufacturing and marketing of products under development 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position  and results of operations and cash flows and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred when the customer takes possession of the products and or risk of loss has passed to the customer 
we provide our customers with a right of return 
revenue is recognized upon delivery of products  at which time a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience 
revenue from service  research and development  and licensing and supply agreements is recognized when the service procedures have been completed or as revenue recognition criteria have been met for each separate unit of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
royalty revenue is recognized based on an estimate of sell through of product based on prescriptions written  until such time that returns from wholesalers and pharmacies can be reasonably estimated 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
drug licenses and related costs 
drug licenses and related costs incurred in connection with acquiring licenses  patents and other proprietary rights related to our commercially developed products are capitalized 
capitalized drug licenses and related costs are being amortized on a straight line basis for periods not exceeding years from the dates of acquisition 
carrying values of such assets are reviewed at least annually by comparing the carrying amounts to their estimated undiscounted cash flows and adjustments are made for any diminution in value 
provision for income taxes 
we have provided for current and deferred us federal  state and foreign income taxes for the current and all prior periods presented 
current and deferred income taxes have been provided with respect to jurisdictions where certain of our subsidiaries produce taxable income 
we have provided a valuation allowance with respect to the remainder of our us deferred income taxes  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in the us  because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our net deferred tax assets for which we have previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency translation 
the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of the period 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses are credited to or charged against other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
revised focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
revised is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  management of the company is evaluating the two methods of adoption allowed by sfas no 
revised  the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method  and the related impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
a substantial amount of our business is conducted in europe and is therefore influenced to the extent to which there are fluctuations in the us dollar s value against other currencies  specifically the euro 
the exchange rate at december  and was 
euros and 
euros per us dollar  respectively 
the weighted average exchange rate for the years ended december   and was 
euros  
euros and euros per us dollar  respectively 
the net effect of foreign currency translation on the company s consolidated financial statements during the year ended december  was an increase of  and the cumulative historical effect was an increase of  as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the carrying value of assets and liabilities can be materially impacted by foreign currency translation  as can the translated amounts of revenues and expenses 
nonetheless  we do not plan to modify our business practices 
we have relied primarily upon financing activities to fund our operations in the us in the event that we are required to fund us operations or cash needs with funds generated in europe or cash requirements in europe with us funds  currency rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant impact on us 
however  at the present time  we do not anticipate altering our business plans and practices to compensate for future currency fluctuations 
interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on our short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt is and the balance outstanding is  as of december  our long term borrowings are non interest bearing and the balance outstanding on these borrowings at december  is  including imputed interest ranging from to of  amounts due within one year totaling  have been classified as current on the consolidated balance sheet at december  the weighted average interest rate on our long term borrowings is 
the effect of an increase in the interest rate of one percentage point one hundred basis points to on short term borrowings and to an average of on long term borrowings would have the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately  annually 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings 
the risks described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all  or part of your investment 
our growth depends on identifying drugs suitable for our drug delivery technologies and expanding our generic and branded drug operations 
our growth depends on the identification of pharmaceutical products that are suitable for delivery using our technologies 
our principal drug delivery technology is our cpe technology 
this technology  like certain other drug delivery technologies  operates to increase the amount and rate of absorption of certain drugs across biological membranes 
this technology does not operate independently and must be coupled with suitable pharmaceutical products in order to provide value 
consequently  our growth will depend to a great extent on identifying and commercializing these suitable drugs with respect to which we intend to expend significant resources and efforts 
identifying suitable products is a lengthy and complex process that may not succeed 
even if identified  products may not be available to us or we may otherwise be unable to enter into licenses or other agreements for their use 
in our efforts to identify suitable products  we compete with other drug delivery companies with greater research and development  financial  marketing and sales resources 
if we do not effectively identify drugs to be used with our technologies  improve the delivery of drugs with our technologies and bring the improved drugs to commercial success  then we may not be able to continue our growth and we will be adversely affected 
we intend to expend significant resources and efforts toward identifying and commercializing products and technologies to expand our generic and branded drug operations in spain and to expand sales of these products outside spain 
although we already manufacture and market generic and branded drugs in spain  the growth of these operations in particular and the company in general will depend to a great extent on identifying and commercializing additional such drugs for which we have existing capacity and infrastructure and  to a lesser extent  on increasing sales of existing products 
identifying and pursuing these new opportunities involves significant time and expense and we may not succeed 
even if identified  these products and technologies may not be commercially successful 
once identified  products to be manufactured and or marketed by us under generic or branded names are subject to successful negotiation of acceptable economic and legal terms  and successful progress of the product through commercialization  as to which we cannot assure you 
when expanding outside spain  we expect to compete in new geographic areas which are governed by regulatory regimes that we have not operated under before 
in these efforts  we compete with other pharmaceutical companies having generic and branded drug operations with greater financial  marketing and sales resources and experience in the geographic areas in which they operate 
if we do not effectively identify generic and branded drugs and technologies and bring them to commercial success  then we will not be able to continue our growth and we will be adversely affected 
the growth of our generic and branded operations may be adversely impacted by claims by others that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of their existing brand name products 
companies that produce brand pharmaceutical products routinely bring litigation against companies who seek regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products and may attempt to secure injunctions that will prevent the generic competitors from eroding their market share 
these companies may allege patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights  which must be decided by the courts 
products using our technologies are in various stages of development and may not achieve commercial success 
independently as well as in conjunction with strategic partners  we are investigating the use of our technologies with respect to a variety of pharmaceutical compounds and products that are in various stages of development 
we are unable to predict whether any of these products will receive regulatory approvals or be successfully developed  manufactured or commercialized 
further  due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained  the time periods before commercialization of any of these products are long and uncertain 
risks during development include the possibility that any or all of the proposed products will be found to be ineffective  the proposed products will have adverse side effects or will otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  the proposed products may be effective but uneconomical to market  or other pharmaceutical companies may market equivalent or superior products 
if medical doctors do not prescribe our products or the medical profession does not accept our products  our ability to grow our revenues will be limited 
our business is dependent on market acceptance of our products by physicians  hospitals  pharmacists  patients and the medical community 
willingness to prescribe our products depends on many factors  including perceived efficacy of our products  convenience and ease of administration  prevalence and severity of adverse side effects in both clinical trials and commercial use  availability of alternative treatments  cost effectiveness  effectiveness of our marketing strategy and the pricing of our products  publicity concerning our products or competing products  and our ability to obtain third party coverage or reimbursement 
even though we have received regulatory approval for testim  and even if we receive regulatory approval and satisfy the above criteria for any of our other product candidates  physicians may not prescribe our products if we do not promote our products effectively 
factors that could affect our success in marketing our products include the effectiveness of our sales force  the effectiveness of our production  distribution and marketing capabilities  the success of competing products  and the availability and extent of reimbursement from third party payors 
if any of our products or product candidates fails to achieve market acceptance  we may not be able to market and sell the products successfully  which would limit our ability to generate revenue 
we will rely on strategic partners to conduct clinical trials and commercialize products that use our drug delivery technologies 
in light of our resources and the significant time  expense  expertise and infrastructure necessary to bring new drugs and formulations from inception to market  we are particularly dependent on resources from third parties to commercialize products incorporating our technologies 
our strategy involves forming alliances with others to develop  manufacture  market and sell our products in the united states and other countries 
we entered into an agreement with perrigo company in november and continue to pursue strategic partners for these purposes 
we may not be successful in finding other strategic partners or in otherwise obtaining financing  in which case the development of our products would be delayed or curtailed 
we must enter into agreements with strategic partners to conduct clinical trials  manufacturing  marketing and sales necessary to commercialize product candidates 
in addition  our ability to apply our drug delivery technologies to any proprietary drugs will depend on our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships or other collaborative arrangements with the holders of proprietary rights to such drugs 
arrangements with strategic partners may be established through a single comprehensive agreement or may evolve over time through a series of discrete agreements  such as letters of intent  research agreements and license agreements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish such strategic partnerships or collaborative arrangements on favorable terms or at all or that any agreement entered into with a strategic partner will lead to further agreements or ultimately result in commercialization of a product 
in collaborative arrangements  we will depend on the efforts of our strategic partners and will have limited participation in the development  manufacture  marketing and commercialization of the products subject to the collaboration 
we cannot assure you that these strategic partnerships or collaborative arrangements will be successful  nor can we assure you that strategic partners or collaborators will not pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products on their own or with others  including our competitors 
in addition  our collaborators or contract manufacturers may be subject to regulatory oversight which could delay or prohibit our development and commercialization efforts 
moreover  we could have disputes with our existing or future strategic partners or collaborators 
any such disagreements could lead to delays in the research  development or commercialization of potential products or could result in time consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration 
if we are unable to meet our responsibilities under any of our agreements  we may lose potential business and be subject to penalties and other damages 
we are a party to a number of agreements pursuant to which we are required to perform certain tasks in accordance with specified schedules 
should we not meet these deadlines and requirements  our counterparties can take actions specified in these agreements which could substantially reduce the amount of revenues the company would receive or terminate the related agreements 
additionally  in accordance with the terms of these agreements  the company may be forced to pay penalties or other damages to our counterparties for breaching these agreements 
we expect to enter into additional agreements in the future 
these agreements may impose various development  funding or other obligations on us 
if we breach any of these obligations  the counterparty may have the right to terminate the agreement or seek other remedies which could significantly reduce expected profits to the company 
disputes may arise with respect to agreements regarding the manufacturing  development and commercialization of any products  including products which incorporate our intellectual property 
these disputes could lead to delays in commercialization of products incorporating our technologies or termination of the agreements 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated by the sale of products formulated from one active ingredient 
spanish sales from our omeprazole product line accounted for approximately and of our consolidated total revenues in and  respectively 
the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our omeprazole products is currently purchased from one supplier 
if we lose and cannot effectively replace our supplier or are otherwise unable to continue the sales of our omeprazole products  our revenues would decline significantly 
pharmaceutical pricing  changes in third party reimbursement and governmental mandates are uncertain and may adversely affect us 
our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare 
a substantial portion of our operations consists of marketing and manufacturing  primarily in spain  generic and branded pharmaceutical products 
the use of generic drugs is regulated in spain  the us and many other countries  and is subject to many changing and competing public policy considerations 
in addition  in certain markets  such as spain  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control through reimbursement limitations 
specifically  prices for prescription pharmaceutical products in spain must be approved by spain s ministry of health 
in order to help control rising healthcare costs  the ministry of health  in recent years  has encouraged the substitution of generic equivalent products 
in further efforts to reduce healthcare costs  the ministry of health had been contemplating new laws and regulations that would significantly reduce the market prices of certain pharmaceutical products  including generic equivalent drugs 
in late october  the spanish government enacted a regulation that reduced the prices that the government reimburses for certain prescription pharmaceutical products 
these new prices became effective on december   however  we voluntarily implemented the lower prices beginning december  the regulation affected six of our chemical entities sold in spain  including the chemical entities omeprazole  simvastatin and enalapril  that reduced our revenues by approximately  in the spanish government temporarily suspended the reference price system that was implemented by the spanish government in late and proposed a point plan to replace the reference price system 
the new plan includes a price reduction in and an additional reduction in on only those drugs that have been on the market in spain for over one year and were not already subject to the reference price reductions for successful commercialization of many of our products  including those using our permeation technologies as well as our generic and branded products  may depend on the availability of reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatment from third party healthcare payors  such as the government  private insurance plans and managed care organizations 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services 
such reimbursement may not be available for any of our products at all or for the duration of the recommended treatment with a drug  which could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize that drug 
the increasing emphasis on managed care in the us continues to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
some governmental agencies  including those in spain  can compel companies to continue to produce products that are not profitable for the company due to insufficient supply 
in the us  there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls 
we anticipate that there will continue to be a number of proposals in the us  as has been the case in many foreign markets 
the announcement or adoption of such proposals could adversely affect us 
further  our ability to commercialize our products may be adversely affected to the extent that such proposals materially adversely affect the business  financial condition and profitability of companies that are prospective strategic partners 
the cost of healthcare in spain  the us and elsewhere continues to be a subject of investigation and action by various governmental agencies 
certain resulting legislative proposals may adversely affect us 
for example  governmental actions to further reduce or eliminate reimbursement for drugs may directly diminish our markets 
in addition  legislative safety and efficacy measures may be invoked that lengthen and increase the costs of drug approval processes 
further  social  economic and other broad policy legislation may induce unpredictable changes in the healthcare environment 
we cannot assure you whether any of these measures may be enacted in some form  if at all  or the impact they may have if enacted 
if our clinical trials fail  we will be unable to market products 
any human pharmaceutical product developed by us would require clearance by the fda for sales in the united states  by spain s ministry of health for sales in spain and by comparable regulatory agencies for sales in other countries 
in the case of non generic products  the process of conducting clinical trials and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals is lengthy and expensive and we cannot be assured of success 
in order to obtain fda approval of any new product candidates using our technologies  an nda must be submitted to the fda demonstrating that the product candidate  based on preclinical research  animal studies and human clinical trials  is safe for humans and effective for its intended use 
positive results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials do not ensure positive results in more advanced clinical trials designed to permit application for regulatory approval 
we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials  even in cases where earlier clinical trials show promising results 
any of our new product candidates may produce undesirable side effects in humans that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities  may suspend our clinical trials at any time if we or they believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or if they find deficiencies in any of our regulatory submissions 
other factors that can cause delay or terminate our clinical trials include slow or insufficient patient enrollment  slow recruitment and completion of necessary institutional approvals at clinical sites  longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  adverse medical reactions or side effects in treated patients  lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested  regulatory requests for additional clinical trials  and instability of the pharmaceutical formulations 
our patent positions and intended proprietary or similar protections are uncertain 
we have filed numerous patent applications and have been granted licenses to  or have acquired  a number of patents 
we cannot assure you  however  that our pending applications will be issued as patents or that any of our issued or licensed patents will afford adequate protection to us or our licensees 
we cannot determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents that are now owned by or may be granted to third parties  the extent to which we may wish  or be required  to acquire rights under such patents or the cost or availability of such rights 
in the event that patent protection for our technologies expire  or are not extended  revenues derived from such technologies may be reduced significantly 
competitors may interfere with our patent process in a variety of ways 
competitors may claim that they invented the claimed invention prior to us 
competitors also may claim that we are infringing their patents  interfering with or preventing the use of our technologies 
competitors also may contest our patents by showing the patent examiner that the invention was not original  was not novel or was obvious 
a competitor could claim that our issued patents are not valid for a variety of other reasons as well 
if a person claims we infringe their technology  we could face a number of consequences  including lawsuits  which take significant time and can be very expensive  payment of substantial damages for infringement  prohibition from selling or licensing the product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us  or reformulation  if possible  of the product so it does not infringe  which could require substantial time and expense 
as an example of the risk of infringement claims  in we were notified that a legal proceeding had been commenced in madrid against us by merck co 
inc and its spanish subsidiary alleging that we violated their patents in our production of the product simvastatin and in we were notified that a legal proceeding had been commenced in madrid against us by glaxosmithkline sa and its spanish subsidiaries alleging that we violated their patents in our production of the product paroxetine 
we cannot assure you that similar such actions will not be brought nor that they will not have an adverse effect on us 
we also rely on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary technologies and continuing technological innovations in the development and commercialization of our products 
we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop the same or similar technologies or obtain access to our proprietary technologies 
it is unclear whether our trade secrets will be protected under law 
while we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets  our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors 
our employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information have entered into or are subject to confidentiality arrangements with us and have agreed to disclose and assign to us any ideas  developments  discoveries and inventions that arise from their activities for us 
we cannot assure you  however  that others may not acquire or independently develop similar technologies or  if effective patents in applicable countries are not issued with respect to our products or technologies  that we will be able to maintain information pertinent to such research as proprietary technologies or trade secrets 
enforcing a claim that another person has illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets  like patent litigation  is expensive and time consuming  and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  we may be subject to the jurisdiction of courts outside the us  some of which may be less willing to protect trade secrets 
regulatory approvals must be obtained and maintained for products incorporating our technologies and  if approvals are delayed or withdrawn  we will be unable to commercialize these products 
government regulations in the united states  spain and other countries have a significant impact on our business and affect the research and development  manufacture and marketing of products incorporating our technologies 
in the united states  spain and other countries  governmental agencies have the authority to regulate the distribution  manufacture and sale of drugs 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions and or criminal prosecution 
in addition  governmental regulations may be established that could prevent  delay  modify or rescind regulatory approval of our products 
our business will suffer if we fail to comply with federal regulations and rules of the securities and exchange commission and new york stock exchange relating to corporate governance reform 
as a public company  we are subject to certain federal regulations and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange 
the sarbanes oxley act of required more stringent accounting  corporate fraud and securities laws 
to implement this legislation  the securities and exchange commission has adopted new rules and may adopt additional rules pertaining to  among other things  additional disclosure and reporting requirements  including requirements relating to internal control procedures 
the new york stock exchange has also adopted various rules relating to corporate governance 
our reputation and financial results could be materially harmed by any failure by us to comply with any current or future rules or regulations relating to the sarbanes oxley act or to any other federal corporate or stock exchange reform measures 
compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of may require a reallocation of resources that would otherwise be dedicated to operating our business 
the sarbanes oxley act of imposed significant new administrative burdens on publicly traded companies 
we expect to incur significant incremental costs in complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
we cannot assure you that these additional costs will result in any increase in revenue or that they will not have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition  because we are a small company with relatively few employees  the individuals responsible for complying with the new statutory and regulatory requirements also have responsibility for business matters 
as a result  our business may suffer if these individuals are forced to spend a disproportionate amount of time on compliance matters 
implementation of new information systems could cause business interruptions and negatively affect our profitability and cash flows 
we are in the process of implementing a new inventory warehouse system to enhance operational efficiencies and provide more effective management of our logistics 
this implementation will enable us to better meet the challenges related to our continued growth and the needs of our customers 
we also plan to upgrade and replace certain of our financial systems to help enable us to meet the new challenges of the new regulatory environment including regulations imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of we expect that  over time  new systems will result in improved business processes and increased operating efficiencies 
as our employees become familiar with the new systems  we expect that some errors may occur  some of which could adversely impact our business and financial results 
there can be no assurance that the systems will perform as expected or that the anticipated improvements in business processes and operating efficiencies will be achieved 
in the event of serious system malfunctions or deficiencies  we might experience business interruptions  which could adversely impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
if we are unable to obtain marketing approvals to sell our products in countries other than spain  we may not be able to obtain additional revenues from sales in those countries 
we cannot assure you that products that have obtained marketing approval in spain will be approved for marketing elsewhere 
if we are unable to obtain marketing approval for our products in countries other than spain  we may not be able to obtain additional revenues from sales in those countries 
we must comply with good manufacturing practices in the production of pharmaceutical products 
any manufacturing facility for pharmaceutical products to be marketed in the united states is subject to fda inspection and inspections by other government agencies both before and after approval of a nda to determine compliance with the fda s gmps requirements  as well as local  state and other federal regulations 
manufacturing facilities for our compounds to be marketed in european countries and elsewhere are also subject to european union and or other applicable gmp regulations 
facilities used to produce our compounds may not achieve or maintain compliance with gmp or other requirements 
the gmp regulations are complex and  if we fail to comply with them  it could lead to rejection or delay of an nda or comparable application 
any delay in approval of an nda or comparable application would delay product launch 
violation of gmp requirements after approval of an nda or comparable application  could result in remedial action  penalties and or delays in production 
we have only one manufacturing facility that can be used to manufacture our pharmaceutical products for sale to others 
we have only one manufacturing facility that can be used to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for sale to others 
all of our manufactured pharmaceutical products are manufactured in one factory in zaragoza  spain 
although we have constructed the factory with redundant lines for our most significant products that are in separate areas of the factory  and installed a fire suppression system  the destruction of the factory by a fire or other catastrophe would have a material impact on our revenues until we are able to rebuild the factory or secure an alternative manufacturing site 
similarly  all of our manufactured active pharmaceutical ingredients are manufactured in one factory in zaragoza  spain 
a fire or other catastrophe would have a material impact on our revenues until we are able to rebuild the factory or secure an alternative manufacturing site 
we operate a significant portion of our business in  and plan to expand further into  markets outside the united states  which subjects us to additional business risks 
during the year ended december   of our revenues were derived from sales made by our spanish subsidiaries in spain and of our revenues were derived from sales made by our spanish subsidiaries to customers in other foreign countries 
we believe that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from sales in foreign countries 
conducting business internationally subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties  including unexpected delays or changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs related to complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  delays and expenses associated with tariffs and other trade barriers  restrictions on and impediments to repatriation of our funds and our customers ability to make payments to us  political and economic instability  acts of terrorism or war  difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing international operations and implementing  maintaining and improving financial controls  dependence upon independent sales representatives and other indirect resellers who may not be as effective and reliable as our employees  inadequate or uncertain protection of intellectual property in foreign countries  increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries  adverse tax consequences or overlapping tax structures  and limitations on the remittance of dividends by foreign subsidiaries 
currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues may be impacted by fluctuations in local currencies due to the fact that of our revenues currently are generated by our spanish subsidiaries  laboratorios belmac  laboratorios davur and laboratorios rimafar 
our spanish subsidiaries reported an increase in net sales of in constant currency for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
an increase in the value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  had the effect of increasing revenues by approximately  during the year ended december  we do not currently engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure because much of our expenditures are in the same currency as our revenues 
our foreign operations expose us to a number of currency related risks  including the following fluctuations in currency exchange rates  limitations on the conversion of foreign currency  and fluctuations of the carrying value of long lived assets 
if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological change and meet the intense competition in our industry  we may not succeed 
our success depends  in part  on achieving and maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in a rapidly evolving industry 
if we unable to continue to develop and or acquire competitive products and technologies  our current and potential strategic partners may choose to adopt the drug delivery technologies of our competitors 
we also compete generally with other drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery technologies or new drug research and testing 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing  managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do and represent significant competition for us 
our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approval for products before we achieve success  if at all 
the products of our competitors may gain market acceptance more rapidly than our products 
developments by competitors may render our existing or proposed products noncompetitive or obsolete 
our competitive positions in our generic and branded drug operations as well as with our drug delivery technologies are uncertain and subject to risks 
in spain  and in other countries  we must demonstrate bioequivalence of our generic products  which may be challenged by branded and other generic competitors as well as regulatory authorities 
in order to demonstrate bioequivalence of our generic products  we must show that the rate and extent of absorption and levels of concentration of our generic products are not statistically different from innovators products that have previously been approved by the regulatory authorities of the respective country  when administered at the same dosage level under similar clinical conditions 
the competitive position of our drug delivery technologies is subject to the possible development by others of superior technologies 
other drug delivery technologies  including oral and injection methods  have wide acceptance  notwithstanding certain drawbacks  and are the subject of improvement efforts by other entities having greater resources 
in addition  our drug delivery technologies are limited by the number and commercial magnitude of drugs with which they can successfully be combined 
we may be unable to meet increasing expenses and demands on our resources from future growth  if any  or to effectively pursue additional business opportunities 
we routinely consider acquisition and investment opportunities  although we have no current agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisitions or investments 
any future acquisitions or investments would further challenge our resources 
if we do not properly meet the increasing expenses and demands on our resources from future growth  we will be adversely affected 
to properly manage our growth  we must  among other things  implement additional and improve existing administrative  financial  marketing  operational and research and development systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
we may also need to expand our staff in these and other areas 
we may not be able to complete the improvements to our systems  procedures and controls necessary to support our future operations in a timely manner 
we may not be able to hire  train  integrate  retain  motivate and manage required personnel  successfully integrate acquisitions or investments  nor successfully identify  manage and pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
we plan to invest approximately million in capital expenditures during the year ending december   to expand our api manufacturing facility  expand our pharmaceutical product manufacturing facility and add new production lines in order to be able to accommodate the level of operations and growth that is anticipated as a result of the company s expansion beyond the borders of spain and the us market 
we plan to finance these expenditures from a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings 
if we fail to generate additional revenue in excess of increased operating expenses in any fiscal period  we may incur losses 
our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to raise or obtain needed funding 
substantial time and financial and other resources will be required to complete ongoing development and clinical testing of our products 
regulatory efforts and collaborative arrangements also will be necessary for our products that are currently under development and testing in order for them to be marketed 
assuming we continue our operations as presently conducted  we believe that we have sufficient working capital to meet our needs for at least the next twenty four months 
however our revenues from operations and cash may not be sufficient over the next several years for commercializing all of the products we are currently developing 
consequently  we may seek strategic partners for various phases of development  marketing and commercialization of product candidates employing our technologies 
further  we cannot assure you as to the sufficiency of our resources or the time required to complete any ongoing development and clinical testing  since the extent to which we conduct such testing is dependent on resource allocation decisions that we make from time to time based on numerous financial as well as operational conditions 
in addition to development and other costs  we expect to incur capital expenditures from time to time 
these capital expenditures will be influenced by our regulatory compliance efforts  our success  if any  at developing collaborative arrangements with strategic partners  our needs for additional facilities and capital equipment and the growth  if any  of our business in general 
there can be no assurance that we will receive additional funding on favorable terms if at all  or that we will be successful in attracting strategic partners 
if we cannot raise funds or engage strategic partners on acceptable terms when needed  we may not be able to continue our research and development activities  develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities  grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
if we undertake an acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs  and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
one of our strategies for business expansion is the acquisition of additional technologies  products and product candidates 
we may attempt to acquire these product candidates  or other potentially beneficial technologies  through the acquisition of businesses  services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
although we currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions  if we undertake an acquisition  the process of integrating the acquired business  technology  service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert significant management attention from our ongoing business operations 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition for a variety of reasons such as an acquired technology or product candidate proving to not be safe or effective in later clinical trials 
we may fund any future acquisition by issuing equity or debt securities  which could dilute your ownership percentage or limit our financial or operating flexibility as a result of restrictive covenants related to new debt 
acquisition efforts can consume significant management attention and require substantial expenditures  which could detract from our other programs 
in addition  we may devote resources to potential acquisitions that are never completed 
if we do not successfully manage our growth  our business goals may not be achieved 
expansion has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
to manage further growth  we will be required to continue to improve existing  and implement additional  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  and hire  train and manage additional employees 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our anticipated growth and we may not be able to hire  train  retain  motivate and manage required personnel 
our failure to manage growth effectively could limit our ability to achieve our business goals 
changes in accounting for expensing of stock options could result in unfavorable charges or require us to change our compensation policies 
we have relied heavily on stock options to compensate existing employees and attract new employees 
we currently are not required to record stock based compensation charges if the employee s stock option exercise price equals or exceeds the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
revised focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
revised is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  management of the company is evaluating the two methods of adoption allowed by sfas no 
revised  the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method  and the related impact on our consolidated financial statements 
when we change our accounting policy to record the fair value of stock options granted  our expenses will increase which will reduce our net income and earnings per share 
we may choose to reduce our reliance on stock options as a compensation tool as a result of the impact of recording stock options at their fair value 
if we reduce our use of stock options  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
if we cannot attract and retain key personnel  we may not be able to execute our business plan as anticipated 
our success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced personnel 
we face significant competition in recruiting competent personnel 
because the location of our headquarters is in an area with relatively few pharmaceutical companies recruiting candidates has been more difficult  as many candidates prefer to work in places with a broad pharmaceutical industry presence 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain additional  competent employees  could adversely affect our business and financial results 
we have assigned many key responsibilities within our company to  and are dependent on  a relatively small number of individuals 
if we lose the services of our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief medical officer  or the general manager of our spanish subsidiary  our ability to execute our business plan in the manner we currently anticipate would be adversely affected 
we maintain key person life insurance only for our chief executive officer 
we have an employment agreement with each of our key personnel 
we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability claims 
the testing and marketing of medical products entails an inherent risk of product liability 
we may be held liable to the extent that there are any adverse reactions from the use of our products 
some of our products involve new methods of delivery for drugs  some of which may require precautions to prevent unintended use  especially since they are designed for patients self use rather than being administered by medical professionals 
the fda may require us to develop a comprehensive risk management program for our products 
the failure of these measures could result in harmful side effects or death 
as a result  consumers  regulatory agencies  pharmaceutical companies or others might make claims against us 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities  lose market share or be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could inhibit or prevent the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop alone or with corporate collaborators 
we maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million euros approximately million us dollars and clinical trial insurance in connection with our clinical testing activities in various amounts on a study by study basis 
while management believes that this insurance is reasonable  we cannot assure you that any of this coverage will be adequate to protect us in the event of a claim 
we  or any corporate collaborators  may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
even if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against losses  such indemnification may not be available or adequate if any claim arises 
our agreement with perrigo company requires us to secure product liability insurance equal to million upon commercialization of the products being developed 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such an amount of coverage at a reasonable cost or at all or that if secured  that it will be adequate to protect us in the event of a claim 
our revenues  operating results and cash flows may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet investor expectations  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
variations in our quarterly and year end operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
if our sales or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
in addition to the other factors discussed under these risk factors  specific factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include demand and pricing for our products  including changes in wholesaler purchasing  government or private healthcare reimbursement policies  physician  pharmacy and patient acceptance of any of our current or future products  patterns or cost structures for our products  introduction of competing products  including generics  any interruption in the manufacturing or distribution of testim or any of our future products  our operating expenses which fluctuate due to growth of our business  timing and size of any new product or technology acquisitions we may complete  and variations in our rates of product returns and allowances 
forecasting our revenues is complicated by difficulties in estimating inventory levels at our wholesalers and pharmacies  the timing of purchases by wholesalers and retailers to replenish inventory and the occurrence and amount of product returns 
your percentage of ownership and voting power and the price of our common stock may decrease as a result of events that increase the number of our outstanding shares 
as of december   we had the following capital structure no 
of shares common stock outstanding  common stock issuable upon exercise of options which are outstanding  exercise of options which are available for grant  total common stock outstanding assuming exercise of all of the above as of december   we had outstanding options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to exercisable at a weighted average of per share  of which approximately  were then vested and exercisable 
we may conduct future offerings of our common stock or other securities with rights to convert the securities into shares of our common stock 
exercise of our outstanding options into shares of our common stock may significantly and negatively affect the market price for our common stock as well as decrease your percentage ownership and voting power 
our stock is volatile 
the market prices for our securities and for securities of emerging growth companies have historically been highly volatile 
during the last two years  the price of our common stock has ranged from a high of to a low of 
future announcements concerning us or our competitors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
factors which may affect our market price include progress of our relationships with strategic partners  results of clinical studies and regulatory reviews  technological innovations by us or our competitors  market conditions in the pharmaceutical  drug delivery and biotechnology industries  effect of regulatory authorities on pricing of products  competitive products  financings  sales or the possibility of sales of our common stock  our results of operations and financial condition  proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety or commercial value of our products  and general economic conditions 
these uncertainties have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuation unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan may prevent or discourage third parties or stockholders from attempting to replace the management of the company 
as a delaware company  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  as amended  which is a statutory provision intended to discourage certain takeover attempts that are not approved by the board of directors 
section prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder subject to certain exceptions 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that also may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal that a stockholder might consider favorable 
our board of directors is divided into three classes with staggered three year terms  which makes it more difficult for an acquiror to change the overall composition of the board in a short period of time 
the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of our outstanding shares is required to approve a merger  a sale or lease of all or substantially all of our assets  certain other business combinations or dissolution or liquidation  and an affirmative vote of two thirds of our outstanding shares is required to amend or repeal any provision in our certificate of incorporation relating to our directors and officers as well as certain other provisions in our certificate of incorporation 
additionally  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series with the rights  obligations and preferences of each series to be determined by our board without stockholder approval 
our staggered board  the super majority voting provisions and the potential issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  preventing or discouraging third parties or stockholders from attempting to replace our management 
to the same potential effect  we have a stockholder rights plan designed to prevent a potential acquirer from gaining control of us without adequately compensating our shareholders and to protect us from coercive takeover attempts 
the rights will become exercisable only if any person or group of affiliated persons beneficially acquires or more of our common stock 
under certain circumstances  each holder of a right other than the person or group who acquired or more of our common stock is entitled to purchase a defined number of shares of our common stock at of its market price at the time that the right becomes exercisable
