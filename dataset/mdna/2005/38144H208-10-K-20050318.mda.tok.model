item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this k 
overview we are a leading provider of solutions that enable community banks to manage accounts receivable financing provided to their small business customers 
our solution is called businessmanager and is based on software  marketing  and online electronic transaction processing services 
one element of businessmanager is our proprietary software  which enables our network of client banks to purchase accounts receivable from their small business customers 
the banks then process  bill and track those receivables on an ongoing basis 
as a major component of our program we work with client banks to design  implement and manage the sale of businessmanager accounts receivable financing services to their small business customers 
we also give our client banks the option of outsourcing to us their application hosting and transaction processing through secure internet connections  allowing them to receive accounts receivable information and make funding decisions electronically 
on january   we completed a capital restructuring event consisting of the sale of  shares of our series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at a price of per share to lightyear fund  lp for a total purchase price of million the capital event  as well as the execution of a new long term credit facility with a bank that allows for total borrowings of up to million the bank of america credit facility 
the completion of this capital event is a significant milestone in our company s history as it improves our capitalization and financial position  which we believe will allow the company to begin a new growth phase 
in other parts of this filing and in previous filings  we have commented that part of our growth strategy is to acquire or develop new products and services 
while this will continue to be one aspect of our strategy  our primary focus in will be to return our core receivables financing business to a growth business 
we believe that the market for our core business is strong 
during  we engaged an independent third party to perform an extensive survey of our bank customers  both present and past 
the results of this survey indicate that bank customers believe in our core product and believe that it is an important product offering for their bank 
we received an overall ranking on a scale of to  which we believe is a strong endorsement of the businessmanager product 
was a year of stabilization and re building a foundation upon which to grow 
while total revenues declined in as compared to  the rate of decline was reduced significantly 
over the course of we invested heavily in our sales force and our sales management 
during our average number of business development managers increased for the first time in approximately four years 
we believe that the investments made in the sales force during position us for improved sales performance in critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the understanding of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition 
we generate revenue from four main sources participation fees earned on client bank purchases of small business accounts receivable 
software license fees from new client banks 
retail planning services 
maintenance fees and other revenues  comprised primarily of fees received for insurance brokerage services  paper based form sales  software maintenance  medical  and processing services 
there are two types of participation fees 
the first type is earned upon the client bank s initial purchase of a small business accounts receivable during the first days in our program 
the second type is an ongoing participation fee earned from subsequent period purchases 
both types of fees are based on a percentage of the receivables that a client bank purchases from its small business customers during each month 
the second type of fee is a smaller percentage of the ongoing receivables purchased 
participation fees are recognized as earned  which is based upon the transaction dates of bank purchases from its small business customers 
software license fees for businessmanager consist of two components the license fee and customer training and support fee 
these are one time fees that we receive upon the initial licensing of our businessmanager program to a community bank 
our license agreements are executed with terms ranging from three to five years and are renewable for subsequent terms 
some agreements contain performance or deferred payment terms that must be met in order for us to receive payment and recognize revenue 
we recognize revenues from the license fee once we have met the terms of the customer agreement 
the customer training and support fee are recognized ratably over the twelve month service period subsequent to the activation of the license agreement 
revenue recognition rules for up front fees are complex and require interpretation and judgment on the part of management 
management has consistently followed the same revenue recognition practices for this type of revenue during all years presented 
we believe that this practice most accurately portrays the economic reality of the transactions 
retail planning services revenue is generated from fees charged primarily for providing inventory merchandising and forecasting information for specialty retail stores and ancillary services related to these products 
rmsa uses proprietary software to process sales and inventory transactions and provide the merchandising forecasting information 
we recognize revenues as the transactions occur and merchandising and forecasting services are performed 
maintenance fees and other revenues include several ancillary products and services we provide to client banks 
annual software maintenance fees are generated from our client banks starting on the first anniversary date of the businessmanager license agreement and annually thereafter 
these revenues are recognized ratably over a twelve month period beginning on the first anniversary date of the agreement 
additionally  since  we have brokered  through our private business insurance subsidiary  credit and fraud insurance products from a national insurance company 
we earn fees based on a percentage of the premium that is paid to the insurance company 
these commission revenues are recognized at the time receivable fundings covered by credit and fraud insurance policies are purchased by our bank customers 
we also provide a standard set of forms that client banks may purchase and use in the normal course of administering the businessmanager program 
revenues related to these forms are recognized in the period that they are shipped to the client bank 
we also have some industry focused applications for the medical and dental markets 
monthly transaction processing fees include charges for electronic processing  statement rendering and mailing  settling payments  recording account changes and new accounts  leasing and selling point of sale terminals  telephone and software support services  rental fees and collecting debts 
software development costs 
software development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products to be sold or marketed are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after such time  any additional costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
also  the company capitalizes the cost of internally used software when application development begins in accordance with aicpa sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this is generally defined as the point when research and development has been completed  the project feasibility established  and management has approved a development plan 
many of the costs capitalized for internally used software are related to upgrades or enhancements of existing systems 
these costs are only capitalized if the development costs will result in specific additional functionality of the existing system  and are capitalized at the point that application development begins 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  generally three years 
the key assumptions and estimates that must be made relative to this accounting policy center around determining when technological feasibility has been achieved and whether the project being undertaken is one that will be marketable or enhance the marketability of an existing product for externally marketed software and whether the project will result in additional functionality for internal use software projects 
management consults monthly with all project managers to ensure that the scope and expected results of each project are understood in order to make a judgment on whether it meets the requirements outlined in the authoritative accounting literature 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the asset and liability method  meaning that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company evaluates its ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the likelihood that the company will have sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the recorded deferred tax assets 
deferred taxes for the company primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards nols  which require considerable judgment as to the ultimate realizability 
for private business  this judgment relies largely on the fact that we expect to have sufficient taxable income in future years that will allow for full utilization of the nols recorded by the company 
the other key assumption impacting the amount of nols recorded by the company as a deferred tax asset is the estimated restrictions in usage due to section of the internal revenue service tax code 
section is very complex requiring significant expertise and professional judgment in order to properly evaluate its impact to the company s usable nols 
the company utilizes an independent public accounting firm to assist with this evaluation and believes that the limitations required by section have been appropriately considered in arriving at the company s deferred tax asset for nols 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of the identified consolidated statement of operations items to total revenues 
year ended december  revenues participation fees software license retail planning services maintenance and other total revenues operating expenses general and administrative selling and marketing research and development amortization other operating total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income income before income taxes income tax provision net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  participation fees 
participation fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the total funding through our businessmanager program 
total receivables funded through businessmanager declined to billion in compared to billion in this decreased funding was primarily the result of fewer merchants funding through our businessmanager program during as compared to the decline is a result of merchants attriting off of the program faster than they are being replenished through new sales 
merchant attrition rates are stable  however new merchant sales were sluggish  which is why the company invested heavily in its sales force during as a percentage of total revenue  participation fees decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year earlier period 
software license 
software license fees decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the slow pace of new licenses sold in the first quarter of total new licensed banks increased in compared to  however more of the new agreements were signed in the second half of due to the revenue recognition deferral policies in place for new license agreements discussed elsewhere in this document  the fact that more of the licenses were signed in late resulted in the decrease in license fees for software license fees accounted for of total revenues for the two years ended december  retail planning services 
retail planning services revenue decreased to million for as compared to million in the decline of  or  from is a result of a decline in point of sale customer support revenues from  in to  in this is due to the point of sale system support services offered relate to a point of sales system that is no longer being marketed  upgraded and sold 
as such  some existing point of sale support customers purchased new point of sale systems and moved their support services elsewhere 
as a percentage of total revenues  retail planning services accounted for during compared to in maintenance and other 
maintenance and other revenues decreased approximately  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  other revenue in includes two unusual revenue items a gain of  resulting from the sale of our bank insurance division in june  and a  gain resulting from a favorable legal settlement 
excluding these two items  other revenue would have been approximately million 
insurance commission revenues decreased approximately  to million in from million in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in factoring commission revenues of approximately  to  in from  in  as well as an increase in other new ancillary product revenues of  as a percentage of total revenues  maintenance and other revenue decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  total revenues 
as a result of the foregoing revenue categories  total revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses include the cost of our executive  finance  human resources  information services  support services  administrative functions and general operations 
the decrease was due to a million decrease in depreciation expense to million in as compared to million in this is due to lower capital spending over the last two years 
also contributing to the decrease was a decline in salary and benefits expense of million  due to a decrease in the number of general and administrative personnel during as compared to as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  selling and marketing expenses include cost of wages and commissions paid to our dedicated business development  bank and retail planning sales force  travel costs of the dedicated sales force  recruiting for new sales and marketing personnel and marketing fees associated with direct and telemarketing programs 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in sales staff  travel expenses and recruiting costs  partially offset by a decrease in commissions expense 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling and marketing expenses increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the previous year ended december  these costs include the non capitalizable direct costs associated with developing new versions of the businessmanager software  as well as  other software development projects that do not meet the capitalization rules 
the decrease was primarily due to fewer personnel on staff devoted to research and development activities in as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses remained constant at for the years ended december  and amortization 
amortization expenses decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the previous year 
these expenses include the cost of amortizing intangible assets including trademarks  software development costs  and debt issuance costs related to our recapitalization in as well as identified intangibles recorded from the towne merger 
the decrease is primarily the result of decreased debt issuance cost amortization associated with our new credit facility  as well as lower software development amortization 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased significantly to million for the year ended december   from approximately  for other operating expenses include property tax and other miscellaneous costs associated with providing support and services to our client banks 
the increase in is due to the capital event transaction discussed elsewhere in this document 
the capital event transaction resulted in two significant unusual items  a  charge for the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the fleet credit facility  and a  charge related to the purchase of a tail directors and officers insurance policy that was required to be expensed immediately 
partially offsetting these two unusual capital event items is a reduction in expense of approximately  due to the favorable conclusion of several state sales tax contingency matters 
excluding these three items  other operating expenses would have been approximately operating income 
as a result of the above factors  our operating income decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the previous year 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased million to  for the year ended december   compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the reduction of our outstanding debt resulting from the capital event transaction 
our average debt balance for was approximately million compared to million in other income 
for the year ended december   the company received proceeds totaling  relating to notes receivable from former officers of one of the company s subsidiaries 
these notes had previously been written off as uncollectible  therefore their collection resulted in this gain 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision for was approximately  as compared to million for the year ended december  during september  the company recorded a tax benefit of  relating to an income tax contingent liability for which the statute of limitations expired in september as a result  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
the company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately in future periods 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  participation fees 
participation fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to two reasons a decrease in the average participation rate and a decrease in the total funding through our businessmanager program 
the average participation rate declined to 
in as compared to 
in the decreased average participation rate was due to two factors 
first  our bank customers  in response to continued declines in interest rates  were forced to lower their service charge  which has a direct effect on our participation rates 
second  in reaction to competitive pressures and the general slow down in the economy  we were forced to make some rate concessions to avoid customer attrition 
total receivables funded through businessmanager declined to billion in compared to billion in this decreased funding was primarily the result of fewer merchants funding through our businessmanager program during as compared to as a percentage of total revenue  participation fees decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year earlier period 
software license 
software license fees decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of new software license agreements funded during compared to software license fees accounted for of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year earlier period  primarily as a result of the decrease in fees discussed above 
the decline is the result of fewer bank salesmen on staff during as compared to  as well as potential bank customers being unwilling to enter into long term contracts due to the company s financial uncertainty that existed throughout retail planning services 
retail planning services revenue decreased to million as compared to million in the decline of million  or  from is a result of a decline in forecast plans produced in as compared to  in compared to  in 
also contributing to the decline was fewer point of sale system support customers  which is due to the point of sale system support services offered relate to a point of sales system that is no longer being marketed  upgraded and sold 
as such some existing point of sale support customers purchased new point of sale systems and moved their support services elsewhere 
as a percentage of total revenues  retail planning services accounted for during compared to in maintenance and other 
maintenance and other revenues decreased approximately  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  other revenue in includes two unusual revenue items a gain of  resulting from the sale of our bank insurance division in june  and a  gain resulting from a favorable legal settlement 
excluding these two items  other revenue would have been approximately million 
insurance commission revenues decreased approximately  to million in from million in in addition  medical processing revenues declined approximately  to  in from  in towne other revenues  which consist of processing fees and machine rental fees  decreased by  to  in from  in  which is a result of the towne products being phased out during late these decreases were partially offset by an increase in factoring commission revenues of approximately  to  in from  in as a percentage of total revenues  maintenance and other revenue increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  total revenues 
as a result of the foregoing revenue categories  total revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses include the cost of our executive  finance  human resources  information services  support services  administrative functions and general operations

research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the previous year ended december  these costs include the non capitalizable direct costs associated with developing new versions of the businessmanager software  as well as  other software development projects that do not meet the capitalization rules 
the decrease was primarily due to fewer personnel on staff devoted to research and development activities in as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  amortization 
amortization expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the previous year 
these expenses include the cost of amortizing intangible assets including trademarks  software development costs  and debt issuance costs related to our recapitalization in as well as identified intangibles recorded from the towne merger 
included in is approximately  of amortization related to identifiable intangibles that were adjusted in june of to their appraised values  of which  relates to prior periods 
excluding the catch up amount of  amortization expense increased approximately  or in the increase is primarily the result of increased debt issuance cost amortization associated with additional debt amendment fees incurred during other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased approximately  for the year ended december   to approximately  other operating expenses include property tax and other miscellaneous costs associated with providing support and services to our client banks 
the increase was primarily the result of a legal dispute settlement that arose and was settled during for  excluding the  legal dispute settlement  other operating expenses remained relatively constant at less than of revenues for the two years ended december  operating income 
as a result of the above factors  our operating income decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the previous year 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the reduction of our outstanding debt  partially offset by higher average interest rates in as compared to in addition to our normal debt service  we reduced long term debt by approximately  using cash from the divestiture of our commercial insurance division 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision for was approximately million as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of income before taxes  the income tax rate was for both and liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations and investment from stockholders 
during  our operating activities provided cash of million 
we used million in our investing activities as a result of fixed asset and software development additions totaling million  which was partially offset by  of cash proceeds received from the sale of our bank insurance division 
cash used in financing activities totaled million for financing activities for included the capital event transaction described elsewhere in this document  which included the retirement of the old fleet credit facility for million  receipt of proceeds from the new preferred stock issuance of million and the receipt of proceeds from the new bank of america credit facility totaling million  net of issuance costs of  subsequent to the capital event transaction  the company s financing activities included the repayment of term debt totaling million and the repayment of revolving credit advances totaling million 
also  the company paid million in preferred stock dividends to the series a and b preferred shareholders 
the company was the borrower under a credit agreement dated august  between the company as borrower and fleet national bank as administrative agent for a syndicate of other lenders the fleet credit facility 
the fleet credit facility was paid in full on january  using the net proceeds received from the lightyear transaction and the net proceeds from the bank of america credit facility 
the company entered into the bank of america credit facility on january  the bank of america credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the company s assets and contains financial and non financial covenants 
the new credit agreement includes a term loan in the amount of million and a revolving line of credit of up to million for a total facility of up to million 
the revolving line of credit includes a million letter of credit sub limit 
as of december   million was outstanding under the bank of america credit facility 
the bank of america credit facility expires on january  the revolving credit commitment reduces by million on each of the first two anniversary dates 
the term loan is repayable in twelve equal quarterly installments of  along with interest at the applicable margin 
interest is also due on the revolving loan quarterly at the applicable margin 
the interest rates of the term loan and revolving loan are based on a pricing grid using the company s funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio  as follows funded debt to ebitda libor base rate less than or equal to libor greater than but less than or equal to libor greater than but less than or equal to libor as of december   the rates  calculated as libor  ranged from to 
the credit agreement includes certain restrictive financial covenants  measured quarterly  relating to net worth  maximum annual capital expenditures  funded debt to ebitda ratio and fixed charges coverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with the restrictive financial and non financial covenants throughout the credit agreement contains customary negative covenants  including but not limited to a prohibition on declaring and paying any cash dividends on any class of stock  except for the series a and series b preferred shares outstanding  provided  that no default  as defined in the credit agreement  exists as of the date of payment and such payment will not cause a default 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately  compared to a working capital deficit of approximately million as of december  the change in working capital resulted primarily from a decrease in the amount of the current portion of long term debt by million  short term borrowings by  dividends payable by  as well as a decrease in accrued liabilities of million partially offset by a million decrease in cash  a decrease in accounts receivable of  and a decrease in current deferred tax assets of  the decrease in current portion of long term debt is a result of the capital event transaction and new debt facility described above  as well as the use of available cash balances to paydown on our revolving line of credit 
the decrease in accrued liabilities relates to the favorable settlement of both income tax and sales tax contingencies that had previously been accrued totaling approximately million 
we believe that the existing cash available  future operating cash flows and our new revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
furthermore  we expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants of our new credit facility throughout there can be no assurance the company will have sufficient cash flows to meet its obligations or that the company will remain in compliance with the new covenants 
non compliance with these covenants could have a material adverse impact to the company s operating and financial results 
the following is a schedule of our obligations and commitments for future payments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years years after long term debt revolving line of credit operating leases total contractual cash obligations standby letters of credit commitment we may  in the future  acquire businesses or products complementary to our business  although we cannot be certain that any such acquisitions will be made 
the need for cash to finance additional working capital or to make acquisitions may cause us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot be certain that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  or that our need for higher levels of working capital will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the company must adopt sfas no 
r no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on july  as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were not material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
seasonality we have generally realized lower revenues and income in the first quarter and  to a lesser extent  in the second quarter of the year 
we believe that this is primarily due to a general slowdown in economic activity following the fourth quarter s holiday season and  more specifically  a decrease in purchased receivables by our client banks 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparison cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
due to the relatively fixed nature of costs such as personnel  facilities and equipment costs  a revenue decline in a quarter will typically result in lower profitability for that quarter 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
note regarding forward looking information this report contains several forward looking statements concerning our operations  prospects  strategies and financial condition  including our future economic performance  intent  plans and objectives  and the likelihood of success in developing and expanding our business 
these statements are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates  which are subject to significant uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
words such as may  would  could  expect  anticipate  believe  intend  plan  and estimate are meant to identify such forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in business risk factors and elsewhere in this report on form k  and include  among other factors  liquidity and capital resources  the timely development and market acceptance of products and technologies  and competitive market conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and cash management activities 
our exposure relates primarily to our long term debt obligations  which expire in pursuant to the bank of america credit facility 
under our current credit facility  our long term debt obligations totaled million as of december  an increase of basis point under the bank of america credit facility will impact future cash flows by approximately  annually
