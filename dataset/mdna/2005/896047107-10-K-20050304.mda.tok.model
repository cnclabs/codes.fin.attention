publishing currently consists primarily of daily newspapers  which include related businesses such as interactive websites 
publishing represented of the company s consolidated revenues in about of publishing revenues were derived from advertising 
these revenues were generated from the sale of advertising space in published issues of the newspapers and on interactive websites 
approximately of publishing revenues were generated from the sales of newspapers to individual subscribers or to sales outlets  which re sell the newspapers 
the remaining of revenues came from a variety of activities including the syndication of columns  features  information and comics to newspapers  commercial printing operations  sales of entertainment listings and other publishing related activities 
publishing advertising revenues are comprised of three basic categories retail  national and classified 
changes in advertising revenues are heavily correlated with changes in the level of economic activity in the united states 
changes in gross domestic product  consumer spending  auto sales  housing sales  unemployment rates  job creation  circulation levels and rates all impact demand for advertising in the company s newspapers 
the company s advertising revenues are subject to changes in these factors both on a national level and on a local level in its markets

compensation  which includes benefits expense  represented of publishing s consolidated operating expenses in compensation expense is affected by many factors  including the level of merit increases  the number of full time equivalent employees and changes in the design and costs of the company s various employee benefit plans 
newsprint and ink represented of the operating expenses for publishing 
the company consumed approximately  metric tons of newsprint in newsprint is a commodity and pricing can vary significantly between years 
other expenses comprised of total operating expenses 
these expenses are principally for the distribution of the newspaper  promotional activities and other general and administrative expenses 
these expenses are typically subject to less variability 
broadcasting and entertainment currently consists of television stations  one radio station  the chicago cubs and tribune entertainment  a company that develops and distributes first run television programming 
broadcasting and entertainment represented of the company s consolidated revenues in about of these revenues came from the sale of advertising spots on its television stations

changes in gross domestic product  consumer spending levels  auto sales  programming content  audience share and rates all impact demand for advertising on the company s television stations 
the company s advertising revenues are subject to changes in these factors both on a national level and on a local level in the markets in which it operates 
significant expense categories for broadcasting and entertainment include programming expense  compensation and other expenses 
programming expense represented of expenses 
the level of programming expense is affected by the cost of programs available for purchase and the selection of programs aired by the company s television stations 
compensation expense represented of broadcasting and entertainment s expenses and is impacted by the same factors as noted for publishing 
other expenses represented of total operating expenses and are for promotional activities and other station operating expenses 
the company uses revenues and operating profit before restructuring charges as ways to measure the financial performance of its business segments 
the company uses average net paid circulation for its newspapers and average audience share for its television stations as a means to measure its publishing and broadcasting and entertainment market shares and performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant policies are summarized in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item these policies conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and reflect practices appropriate to the company s businesses 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its policies and estimates  including those related to income taxes  pension and postretirement benefits  broadcast rights  goodwill and other intangible assets  self insurance liabilities  accounts receivable allowances and stock based compensation 
management has discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development  selection and disclosure of the critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates 
in addition  there are other items within the financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed to be critical accounting policies and estimates 
changes in the estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on the financial statements 
income taxes the company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes 
the company records its tax liabilities based on estimates of the amount of taxes that will ultimately be paid 
since the company s tax returns are subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs and various states  tax liabilities are maintained for estimated federal and state audit adjustments 
the company reduced its income tax expense and liabilities by a total of million in and million in as a result of favorably resolving certain federal and state income tax issues 
during  times mirror  which was acquired by the company in  disposed of its matthew bender and mosby subsidiaries in separate tax free reorganizations 
while the company strongly believes that these transactions were completed on a tax free basis  the irs has audited the transactions and disagreed with the position taken by times mirror 
in  the company received an irs adjustment to increase times mirror s taxable income by approximately billion 
if the irs prevails  the company s federal and state income tax liability would be approximately million  plus interest 
as of dec 
  the interest on the proposed taxes would be approximately million 
the company intends to vigorously defend its position and filed a petition in us tax court on nov 
 to contest the irs position 
in december  the company presented its position in us tax court 
the company does not expect to receive the court s decision before the fourth quarter of a tax reserve of million  plus million of interest  relating to these transactions is included in other obligations on the consolidated balance sheets 
times mirror established the million tax reserve in when it entered into the transactions based on its assessment  along with its tax advisors  of the amount needed to resolve a dispute with the irs 
the company evaluates the adequacy of this reserve on a periodic basis 
the company has maintained this initial reserve as no new information has become available which would warrant a change in that reserve 
the resolutions of the company s tax issues are unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than that which has been provided by the company 
pension and postretirement benefits the company provides defined benefit pension  postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees under a variety of plans see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item 
accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires the use of several assumptions 
weighted average assumptions used each year in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits were pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations increase in future salary levels for expense increase in future salary levels for obligations long term rate of return on plans assets the company expects to use a long term rate of return assumption of in  consistent with the assumption 
the long term rate of return assumption is subject to change due to the fluctuation of returns in the overall equity and debt markets 
as of the date of this report  a decrease in the company s long term rate of return assumption would result in a million increase in the company s net pension expense 
in  the pension plans assets earned a return of approximately 
the company will use a discount rate of for expense in at dec 
 and dec 
  the company s prepaid pension asset included an unrecognized net actuarial loss of million and million  respectively 
a significant portion of this net actuarial loss resulted from the difference between the company s expected returns on plan assets and the actual losses on plan assets in and expected returns on plan assets were million and million in and  respectively  actual losses were million and million  respectively 
in accordance with financial accounting standard fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the actuarial loss will be recognized in net periodic pension expense over the estimated average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
the company s policy is to incorporate asset related gains and losses into the asset value used to calculate the expected return on plan assets and into the calculation of amortization of unrecognized net actuarial loss over a four year period 
as a result of all these factors  the company expects to incur net pension expense of million in as compared to million in the company s pension plans asset allocations at dec 
 and dec 
  were as follows in millions plan assets asset category dec 
 dec 
 equity securities   fixed income securities other total   the company s current target allocation for pension plans assets is in equity securities and in fixed income securities and other 
for purposes of measuring postretirement health care costs  a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to for and remain at that level thereafter 
for purposes of measuring health care obligations at dec 
  a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to for and remain at that level thereafter 
on dec 
  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of act was signed into law 
the act resulted in a million reduction in the accumulated other postretirement obligations for prior service costs and a million reduction in net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans 
as of the date of this report  a change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in thousands increase decrease service cost and interest cost benefit obligation   the company plans to contribute million related to certain of its union and non qualified pension plans and million to its other postretirement benefit plans in expected future benefit payments the following benefit payments  which reflect expected future service  as appropriate  are expected to be paid in thousands pension benefits other postretirement benefits broadcast rights broadcast rights consist principally of rights to broadcast syndicated programs  sports and feature films and are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the total cost of these rights is recorded as an asset and a liability when the program becomes available for broadcast 
syndicated program rights that have limited showings are generally amortized using an accelerated method as programs are aired 
sports and feature film rights are amortized using the straight line method 
the current portion of broadcast rights represents those rights available for broadcast that are expected to be amortized in the succeeding year 
at dec 
 and dec 
  the company had broadcast rights assets of million and million  respectively 
the company maintains an allowance for programming that is not expected to be aired by the end of the contract period 
this allowance for excess programming inventory is based on a program by program review of the company s five year broadcast plans and historical write off trends 
the total reserve balance at dec 
 and dec 
 was million and million  respectively 
actual write offs in and were million and million  respectively 
future write offs can vary based on changes in consumer viewing trends and the availability and costs of other programming 
goodwill and other intangible assets at the beginning of the fiscal year  the company adopted fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer be amortized to earnings  but be reviewed periodically for impairment 
under fas no 
 the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization must be based generally on fair values 
as a result of initially applying the new impairment provisions of fas no 
 the company recorded a pretax charge of million million after tax in the first quarter of the charge related to certain of the company s newspaper mastheads million  a federal communications commission fcc license million and a television network affiliation agreement million  and is presented as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the impairments were primarily the result of decreases in operating revenues compared to forecasts prepared at the dates the respective companies were acquired 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is allocated is determined using multiples of operating cash flows for purposes of analyzing goodwill for impairment 
the estimated fair values of other assets subject to the annual impairment review  which include newspaper mastheads and fcc licenses  are calculated based on projected future discounted cash flow analyses 
the development of market multiples and cash flow projections used in the analyses requires the use of assumptions  including assumptions regarding revenue and market growth 
the analyses use discount rates based on specific economic factors in the publishing and broadcasting industries 
these assumptions reflect the company s best estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the company s control 
in the fourth quarter of  the company elected to early adopt the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force topic no 
d  which requires the use of a direct valuation method for valuing intangible assets  such as fcc licenses  and reviewing them for impairment 
historically  the company had been using a residual valuation method to review its fcc licenses for impairment each year 
a direct valuation method generally results in a lower valuation than does a residual valuation method 
the company performed an impairment review of its fcc licenses for the years ended dec 
 and dec 
 using a residual method 
no impairments were required as a result of the analyses performed in these years 
the effect of changing to a direct valuation method for the fcc licenses impairment review was a pretax charge of million million after tax 
the charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of income 
upon the adoption of fas no 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company treated the intangible assets associated with network affiliation agreements as having indefinite lives and stopped recording amortization expense on these assets 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission provided guidance regarding their accounting position in this area indicating that network affiliation agreements should be amortized 
as a result  the company began amortizing these assets in the fourth quarter of using a year life 
the company believes the year life is representative of the remaining expected useful life of the network affiliation intangibles 
the provisions of fas no 
required the company to perform an impairment analysis at the time of a change in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset which was previously not being amortized 
no adjustment to the network affiliation intangible assets was required as a result of this impairment review performed in the fourth quarter of beginning in  the company no longer performs an annual test of the impairment of its network affiliation agreements under fas no 
 but will perform an impairment test if indicators of impairment are present  as required by fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company s goodwill and other intangible assets at dec 
 consisted of the following in thousands gross amount accumulated amortization net amount intangible assets subject to amortization subscribers useful life of to years   network affiliation agreements useful life of years  other useful life of to years    total    goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization goodwill publishing  broadcasting and entertainment  total goodwill  newspaper mastheads  fcc licenses  tradename  total  total goodwill and other intangible assets  self insurance liabilities the company self insures for certain medical and disability benefits  workers compensation costs and automobile and general liability claims 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods and are not discounted 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims  claim growth and claims incurred but not reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in different liabilities than the amounts currently recorded 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks totaled million and million at dec 
 and dec 
  respectively 
accounts receivable allowances the company s accounts receivable are primarily due from advertisers 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer s financial condition and generally collateral is not required 
the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts  rebates and volume discounts 
this allowance is determined based on historical write off experience and any known specific collectibility exposures 
at dec 
 and dec 
  the company s allowance for accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recorded because the exercise price of employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
under fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by fas no 
 compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
for purposes of the disclosure required by fas no 
 as amended by fas no 
 the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of each option grant 
the black scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect the company s best estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the control of the company 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  pro forma stock based compensation  as calculated and disclosed under fas no 
could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if the company uses different assumptions in future periods  pro forma stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 
r  share based payment 
fas no 
r supercedes apb no 
 fas no 
 as amended by fas no 
 and related interpretations 
under fas no 
r  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is required to be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
the company plans to adopt fas no 
r in the third quarter of note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item presents the pro forma net income the company would have recognized had compensation costs for the company s incentive compensation plans been determined consistent with fas no 
the company is in the process of analyzing the impact of the adoption of fas no
