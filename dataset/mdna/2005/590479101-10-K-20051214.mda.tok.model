executive overview general mesa is a holding company whose principle subsidiaries operate as regional air carriers providing scheduled passenger and airfreight service 
as of september   the company served cities in states  the district of columbia  canada and mexico and operated a fleet of aircraft with approximately  daily departures 
approximately of our consolidated passenger revenues for the fiscal year ended september  were derived from operations associated with code share agreements 
our subsidiaries have code share agreements with america west  midwest airlines  united airlines and us airways 
the remaining passenger revenues are derived from our independent operations 
in fiscal  approximately of our passenger revenue was associated with revenue guarantee flying 
the america west regional jet and dash  united regional jet and dash  and us airways regional jet code share agreements are revenue guarantee flying agreements 
under the terms of these flying agreements  the major carrier controls marketing  scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories 
our role is simply to operate our fleet in the safest and most reliable manner in exchange for fees paid under a generally fixed payment schedule 
we received a guaranteed payment based upon a fixed minimum monthly amount plus amounts related to departures and block hours flown in addition to direct reimbursement of expenses such as fuel  landing fees and insurance 
among other advantages  revenue guarantee arrangements reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in passenger traffic and fare levels  as well as fuel prices 
in fiscal  approximately of our fuel purchases were reimbursed under revenue guarantee code share agreements 
in fiscal  approximately of our passenger revenue was associated with pro rate and independent flying 
the us airways beechcraft d turboprop  midwest airlines and america west beechcraft d turboprop code share agreements are pro rate agreements  for which we received an allocated portion of each passenger s fare and we pay all of the costs of transporting the passenger 
in addition to carrying passengers  we carry freight and express packages on our passenger flights and have interline small cargo freight agreements with many other carriers 
we also have contracts with the us postal service for carriage of mail to the cities we serve and occasionally operate charter flights when our aircraft are not otherwise used for scheduled service 
fleet in fiscal  we continued our regional jet fleet growth by growing from regional jets at september  to regional jets at september  
table of contents the company also continued reducing the number of b aircraft in service by leasing some of these aircraft to other operators 
in october  the company entered into an agreement to lease four of its beechcraft d aircraft operated by air midwest to gulfstream and in january  we entered into another agreement to lease ten beechcraft d aircraft to big sky 
as of september   we had leased nine aircraft to big sky pursuant to this agreement and subleased the tenth aircraft to big sky in the first quarter of fiscal as of september   we owned beechcraft d aircraft and were operating of these aircraft 
aircraft in operation at september  type of aircraft crj regional jet crj regional jet crj regional jet embraer regional jet beechcraft d dash total aircraft financing in september  the company completed the permanent financing of crj regional jets through a sale and leaseback transaction 
as a result of this transaction  which was structured as an off balance sheet operating lease  approximately million in both the asset and related debt were removed from the company s balance sheet 
in october  the company permanently financed five crj aircraft with million in debt 
the debt bears interest at the monthly libor plus three percent and requires monthly principal and interest payments 
the manufacturer has entered into an arrangement on the company s behalf to limit the company s variable interest rate exposure with respect to these aircraft 
these aircraft had been originally acquired with interim financing from the manufacturer 
code share agreements in may  the company announced a code share arrangement between the company  freedom  and delta that provides for freedom to become a delta connection partner 
under the terms of the agreement  freedom commenced operations in october and will operate up to seat regional jet aircraft on routes throughout delta s network 
the arrangement required mesa to partially reimburse delta s lease payments associated with delta s dornier fairchild jets throughout the term of the agreement in exchange for performing flight services under the agreement  however  the requirement to reimburse delta for certain lease costs was terminated when delta filed for bankruptcy protection 
the code share arrangement will terminate with respect to each aircraft  on an aircraft by aircraft basis  beginning in approximately twelve years 
delta may terminate the code share agreement at any time  with or without cause  upon twelve months prior written notice following the sixth anniversary of the in service date of the th aircraft added to the delta connection fleet 
however  delta has not yet assumed our code share agreement in its bankruptcy proceedings and could choose to terminate our agreement at any time prior to its emergence from bankruptcy 
in may  the company amended its code sharing arrangement with united to allow the company to put up to an additional seat regional jet aircraft into the united express system and extend the expiration dates under the existing code share agreement with respect to certain aircraft 
in connection with the amendment  the company agreed to make three million payments to united as follows i million in june  ii million in october  and iii million in november 
table of contents as of september   we operated seat regional jets for us airways 
as a result of us airways emergence from bankruptcy and their non assumption of our code share agreement  we began working with us airways to provide for the transition of these jets to our united and delta code sharing arrangements 
as of december   we had transitioned seat regional jets out of us airways system 
we expect to complete the transition of aircraft from us airways to united in the first quarter of fiscal year and to delta in the second quarter of fiscal year rotable spare parts maintenance agreements in august  the company entered into a ten year agreement with aar corp 
the aar agreement  for the management and repair of certain of the company s crj   and erj aircraft rotable spare parts inventory

under the agreement  the company is required to pay aar a monthly fee based upon flight hours for the management of  access to and maintenance of the inventory 
the agreement also contains certain minimum monthly payments that mesa must make to aar 
at termination  the company may elect to purchase the covered inventory at fair market value  but is not contractually obligated to do so 
the aar agreement is contingent upon the company terminating an agreement for the company s crj aircraft rotable spare parts inventory with ge capital aviation services gecas  and including these rotables in the arrangement 
the company notified gecas of its intent to cancel that agreement in august and terminated the agreement in november other operations the company announced its intention to establish an independent inter island hawaiian airline with service expected to begin in early to mid calendar the airline will be conducted using state of the art new generation regional jets in a high quality  high frequency service  connecting the islands of hawaii with service to the hilo  honolulu  kona  lihue and maui kahului markets

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  medical claims reserve  valuation of assets held for sale and costs to return aircraft and a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
such historical experience and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which contains 
table of contents accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
revenue recognition the america west  united and the us airways regional jet code share agreements are revenue guarantee flying agreements 
under a revenue guarantee arrangement  the major airline generally pays a fixed monthly minimum amount  plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights flown and block hours performed 
the contracts also include reimbursement of certain costs incurred by us in performing flight services 
these costs  known as pass through costs  may include aircraft ownership cost  passenger and hull insurance  aircraft property taxes as well as  fuel  landing fees and catering 
the contracts also include a profit component that may be determined based on a percentage of profits on the mesa flown flights  a profit margin on certain reimbursable costs as well as a profit margin based on certain operational benchmarks 
we recognize revenue under our revenue guarantee agreements when the transportation is provided 
the majority of the revenue under these contracts is known at the end of the accounting period and is booked as actual 
we perform an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period 
all revenue recognized under these contracts is presented at the gross amount billed 
under the company s revenue guarantee agreements with america west  us airway and united  the company is reimbursed under a fixed rate per block hour plus an amount per aircraft designed to reimburse the company for certain aircraft ownership costs 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  the company has concluded that a component of its revenue under the agreement discussed above is rental income  inasmuch as the agreement identifies the right of use of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time 
the amount deemed to be rental income during fiscal and was million and million  respectively  and has been included in passenger revenue on the company s consolidated statements of income 
in connection with providing service under the company s revenue guarantee agreement with us airways  the company s fuel reimbursement is capped at per gallon 
under this agreement  the company has the option to purchase fuel from a subsidiary of us airways at the capped rate 
as a result  amounts included in revenue for fuel reimbursement and expense for fuel cost may not represent market rates for fuel for the company s us airways flying 
the company purchased million gallons  million gallons and million gallons of fuel under this arrangement in fiscal  and  respectively 
the america west  us airways and midwest airlines bd turboprop code share agreements are pro rate agreements 
under a prorate agreement  we receive a percentage of the passenger s fare based on a standard industry formula that allocates revenue based on the percentage of transportation provided 
revenue from our pro rate agreements and our independent operation is recognized when transportation is provided 
tickets sold but not yet used are included in air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
we also receive subsidies for providing scheduled air service to certain small or rural communities 
such revenue is recognized in the period in which the air service is provided 
the amount of the subsidy payments is determined by the united states department of transportation on the basis of its evaluation of the amount of revenue needed to meet operating expenses and to provide a reasonable return on investment with respect to eligible routes 
eas rates are normally set for two year contract periods for each city 
allowance for doubtful accounts amounts billed by the company under revenue guarantee arrangements are subject to our interpretation of the applicable code share agreement and are subject to audit by our code share partners 
periodically our code share partners dispute amounts billed and pay amounts less than the amount billed 
ultimate collection of the remaining amounts not only depends upon mesa prevailing under audit  but also upon the financial well being of the code share partner 
as such  we periodically review amounts past due and records a reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at september  and  respectively 
if our actual ability to collect these receivables and 
table of contents the actual financial viability of its partners is materially different than estimated  the company s estimate of the allowance could be materially understated or overstated 
aircraft leases the majority of the company s aircraft are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
accrued health care costs we are currently self insured up to a cap for health care costs and as such  a reserve for the cost of claims that have not been paid as of the balance sheet date is estimated 
our estimate of this reserve is based upon historical claim experience and upon the recommendations of our health care provider 
at september  and  we accrued million and million  respectively  for the cost of future health care claims 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the accrual for future health care claims could be materially overstated or understated 
accrued worker s compensation costs beginning in fiscal  we implemented a new worker s compensation program 
under the program  we are self insured up to a cap for worker s compensation claims and as such  a reserve for the cost of claims that have not been paid as of the balance sheet date is estimated 
our estimate of this reserve is based upon historical claim experience and upon the recommendations of our third party administrator 
at september   we accrued million for the cost of worker s compensation claims 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the accrual for future worker s compensation claims could be materially overstated or understated 
long lived assets  aircraft and parts held for sale property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives to their estimated salvage values using the straight line method 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company records an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if an impairment loss has occurred  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company records deferred tax assets for the value of benefits expected to be realized from the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and state and federal net operating loss carryforwards 
we periodically review these assets for realizability based upon expected taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent we believe some portion of the benefit may not be realizable  an estimate of the unrealized portion is made and an allowance is recorded 
at september   we had a valuation allowance for certain state net operating loss carryforwards because we believe we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income in these jurisdictions in the future to realize the benefits of these recorded 
table of contents deferred tax assets 
we believe the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the benefits of its other deferred tax assets 
this belief is based upon the company having had pretax income in fiscal  and and we have taken steps to minimize the financial impact of its unprofitable subsidiaries 
realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of any net operating loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining  recorded deferred tax assets will be realized 
if the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is significantly different from our expectations  the value of its deferred tax assets could be materially overstated 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  requiring all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company intends to adopt fas r beginning in its first quarter of fiscal  which ends december   and intends to utilize the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  option awards granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption are required to be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the effective date will continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas  and compensation amounts for awards that vest will now be recognized in the income statement as an expense 
adoption of the pronouncement is estimated to have a million impact on after tax earnings in fiscal item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and short term marketable investment portfolio 
certain of our debt obligations are variable in rate and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates would result in an approximately million impact on interest expense 
we also have investments in debt securities 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in fiscal year interest income would be impacted by approximately million 
we have exposure to certain market risks associated with our aircraft fuel 
aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier and even marginal changes in the cost of fuel greatly impact a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they insure availability of supply 
however  the america west  united and us airways revenue guarantee code share agreements allow fuel costs to be reimbursed by the code share partner  thereby reducing our overall exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in fiscal  approximately of our fuel requirements were associated with these contracts 
each one cent change in the price of jet fuel amounts to a million change in annual fuel costs for that portion of fuel expense that is not reimbursed by our code share partners
