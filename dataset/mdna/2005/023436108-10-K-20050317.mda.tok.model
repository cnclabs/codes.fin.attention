item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the risk factors included herein and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto referenced in item overview amedisys is a leading provider of home health nursing services 
the company generates revenue and profits primarily by providing medicare eligible patients with home health care services and also by delivering these services to patients with benefits coverage provided by insurance companies  managed care organizations and self insured employers 
during  the company acquired two hospice agencies from tenet healthcare these agencies contributed approximately million  or less than  to net service revenue for the year 
the balance of the discussion below refers to the company s home health care operations  unless otherwise noted 
the company s services are delivered in the various geographic markets served by the company hours per day  days per week  and are delivered through operating locations as at december  and as of march approximately of amedisys revenue is generated from a single payor the medicare program  with the balance derived from commercial insurers and state medicaid programs 
the medicare program is subject to legislative and other risk factors that can result in fluctuating reimbursement rates for the company s services 
despite these risks  the company believes it can operate effectively by increasing its volume of medicare patients  and implementing new business processes  and utilizing technology  to make the company an increasingly efficient provider of services 
there are several factors  which lead the company to believe it can continue to grow in the marketplace 
these factors include the cost of a home health care visit can be significantly lower than the cost of an average day in a hospital  the demand for home health care is expected to grow  primarily due to an aging population as well as patient preference  and a highly fragmented industry with many smaller competitors 
in order to take advantage of these trends  the company s strategic approach is to focus on employees  expand the range and scope of services offered  enhance disease management capabilities  and utilize improved technology wherever possible 
results from this strategic approach are reflected in amedisys fiscal financial performance 
the company reported fiscal net service revenue of million  an increase of compared to fiscal  and earnings per diluted share of  compared to the reported for fiscal 
table of contents during fiscal  the company reported cash flow from operations of million  an increase of from fiscal in addition  the company issued stock in a public offering of common stock in september  resulting in net cash proceeds of million 
the company increased its cash balances to approximately million at december   as compared with million at december  the following discussion of amedisys financial condition and results of operations are intended to assist in understanding the company s financial statements and significant changes to its operations and other factors impacting such financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of our net service revenue net service revenue cost of service revenue excluding amortization and depreciation gross margin general and administrative expenses salaries and benefits other total general and administrative expenses operating income other expense  net income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income years ended december  and net service revenue 
approximately of the company s net service revenue for the year ended december  was derived from medicare  compared to for the previous year 
included in the net service revenue is million  or of total net service revenue  for services provided by the company s hospice business acquired in the second quarter of from tenet healthcare 
with respect to the home health nursing operations  the company is paid by medicare based on completed episodes of care 
an episode of care may arise from either a new admission  or by a physician ordering additional episodes of care for an existing patient 
for each episode of care  the company receives the applicable amount for each patient s diagnoses  location and severity of illness see revenue recognition discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the case of non medicare patients  the company is generally paid on a per visit basis for each patient admission 
net service revenue increased million  or  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in this increase is due to a increase in medicare revenue of million  and a increase in revenue from non medicare payors of million 
of the increase in medicare revenue  million is attributable to the hospice business 
of the remaining million balance of this increase  million is attributable to acquisitions completed after january  with the exception of the hospice revenue mentioned above see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of 
table of contents company acquisitions 
the remaining million reflects increases in medicare patient admissions and a improvement in revenue per episode 
substantially all of the improvement in revenue per episode is due to internal improvements and analysis of episodes of care 
in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that amounts previously reserved against revenue in and million and million  respectively were no longer necessary as a consequence of consistent application of the company s revenue recognition policy  the conversion of all metro locations  acquired in august  to the amedisys systems  and the commencement of appropriate billing procedures for the company s hospice acquisitions 
the reversal of these reserves increased net service revenues by million in the fourth quarter of total patient admissions for the year ended december  totaled  and increased from the prior year admissions by 
medicare patient admissions increased to  representing an increase of approximately over the twelve months ended december  the increase in medicare admissions for the most recent yearly comparative period is comprised of internal growth in admissions of with acquisitions contributing growth of approximately 
the company defines internal growth to include growth from operating locations owned by the company for more than twelve months  any start up locations initiated by the company  and from those acquisitions where the monthly medicare admissions at the acquired locations does not exceed of total company admissions in the month of acquisition 
internal growth of  including growth from new locations  arises from a combination of enhanced effectiveness of the sales force  increased size of the sales force  the introduction of additional disease management programs  and ongoing referral source education efforts 
admissions from non medicare payors increased by from  in the twelve months ended december  to  in the same period in  primarily as a result of acquisitions 
cost of service revenue cost of service revenue for the twelve months ended december  increased by million  or  as compared to the same period in of this increase  million is attributable to the hospice business 
the balance of the increase  million  is attributable to a increase in the total number of home health visits performed to  visits  and by a increase in the cost per visit 
the number of visits increased by as a result of a increase in visits for non medicare patients and a increase in the number of visits to medicare patients 
this increase in the number of visits to medicare patients is due to an increase in the average number of patients on service at month end during the most recent year of approximately  when compared with approximately  in the comparable period of the increase in the cost per visit is attributable to higher rates of pay and benefits for visiting staff  including those at the acquired locations  and an increase of approximately in the rate of reimbursement per visit for mileage 
typically  our acquisitions take up to months to reach the labor efficiencies of existing operations 
excluding the hospice business  cost of service revenue as a percent of net service revenue  increased  in large part due to the increased cost per visit as described above 
general and administrative expenses g a general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in the year ended december   as compared to this increase is primarily attributable to million of general and administrative expenses incurred by the company s acquisitions finalized since january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining balance of million includes increased personnel costs of million related to additional operational and corporate staff necessitated by the company s internal growth and acquisitions  other increases of million  including increases with respect to supplies  rent  and professional fees  a million increase in depreciation and amortization  primarily as a result of higher amortization associated with intangible assets attributable to the acquisitions  and an increase in travel and related costs of million  particularly with respect to operational and corporate training meetings and new employee orientation sessions undertaken for all employees 
in addition  severance costs of million pursuant to agreements reached with certain employees were accrued in the fourth quarter of

other income and expense  net 
net other income and expense decreased to  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  in this decrease in net other income and expense is primarily attributable to a million current year decrease in interest expense due to lower debt levels and a million increase in interest income from increased levels of cash and cash equivalents resulting from the current year third quarter equity offering

years ended december  and net service revenue the company is paid by medicare based on completed episodes of care 
an episode of care may arise from either a new admission or by a physician ordering additional episodes of care for an existing patient 
for each episode of care  the company receives the amount appropriate to each patient s diagnoses  location and severity of illness see revenue recognition 
in the case of non medicare patients  the company is generally paid on a per visit basis  which still requires an admission to take place 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   net service revenue increased by million  or  as a result of the factors described below 
net service revenue was decreased by million in the year ended december  due to changes in prior years estimates for pps revenue see medicare revenue recognition discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements  and by million in the year ended december  due to changes in prior years cost report estimates see liquidity and capital resources

non medicare revenue accounted for approximately of net service revenue for the period  compared to in 
table of contents cost of service revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   cost of service revenue increased by  or million 
this increase is attributable to a decrease in the total number of visits performed to million visits offset by a increase in the cost per visit 
the number of visits decreased to million as a result of a decrease in visits for non medicare patients for the reason noted above  and a increase in the number of visits to medicare patients 
this increase in the number of visits to medicare patients is due to a increase in the number of completed episodes  offset by an approximately decrease in the number of visits per medicare episode 
the increase in the cost per visit is attributable to increased rates of pay  including benefits for full time staff and for visiting staff 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or by  in as compared to this increase is primarily attributable to million of general and administrative expenses for the acquisition of metro preferred completed in august additional increases included million related to outsourcing of operational functions  increased personnel costs  particularly bonuses for corporate personnel of approximately million  and an increase of million in legal and other professional fees  particularly with respect to ongoing litigation related to the ncfe matter  as well as costs related to the applications for and defense of awards of cons for expanded service coverage in georgia  tennessee and alabama 
these increases were offset by a reduction in health insurance and other benefit costs of million  and a decrease in bad debt expense of million 
the company also reduced the personnel costs associated with the administration of our field offices by million when compared with as a result of the restructuring undertaken in the fourth quarter of with respect to the oig matter described below  the company incurred million in reserves in the year which were not required in as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in in  the company discovered questionable conduct involving the former owner of one of our smaller agencies that occurred between and the company conducted an initial audit using an independent auditor and voluntarily disclosed the irregularities to the department of health and human services office of the inspector general oig 
since that time  the oig has been examining the disclosed activities and during the second quarter of  a further audit of relevant claims was initiated at the request of the government  which was completed during the third quarter of management believes the company has adequately reserved for the estimated liability associated with this incident  including million in additional reserves provided in the fourth quarter of in february  the oig offered a settlement that included certain penalties not previously anticipated by the company  as the company self reported the matter 
on august   the company signed both a settlement agreement and a corporate integrity agreement with the oig and department of justice 
the settlement agreement provides for payment of a financial settlement in three equal annual payments of  with the first payment made on the date of execution 
this agreement also obligates the company to amend previously filed cost reports to deduct costs incurred by the company for audit and investigation of this matter 
the corporate integrity agreement  which is binding for a three year period  requires that the company maintain its existing compliance program and provides for enhanced training requirements  annual claims audits of the subject agency by an independent reviewer  and regular reporting to the oig 
this agreement provides for stipulated penalties in the event of non compliance by the company  including the possibility of exclusion from the medicare program 
the company believes that these obligations will not materially affect the company s operations  or financial performance  over the period of the agreement  although no assurances can be provided that the ultimate cost will not be materially different 
management believes the company is in compliance with the corporate integrity agreement at december  and december  operating income the company had operating income of million in as compared to operating income of million in the increase in operating income of million is attributable to the changes described above

these judgments and estimates are based on  among other things  historical experience and information available from outside sources 
the critical accounting policies presented below have been discussed with the audit committee as to the development and selection of the accounting estimates used as well as the disclosures provided herein 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
medicare revenue recognition the following comments pertain to the company s home care nursing services 
since october  with the implementation of pps  the company has been paid by medicare based on episodes of care 
an episode of care is defined as a length of care up to days with multiple continuous episodes allowed 
a base episode payment is established by the medicare program through federal legislation for all episodes of care ended on or after the applicable time periods detailed below period beginning base episode payment october  through march   per episode april  through september   per episode october  through september   per episode october  through september   per episode october  through march   per episode april  through december   per episode january  through december   per episode 
table of contents the provision in the benefits improvement and protection act bipa whereby home health providers received a increase in reimbursement that began april for serving patients in rural areas expired march   however  in april  a increase in reimbursement was reinstated for a one year period 
patients in rural areas account for approximately of the company s patient population as of december  medicare reimbursement rates are subject to change 
the applicability of a reimbursement change depends upon the completion date of the episode and generally applies to all episodes ending after the effective date of the change 
therefore  any change in medicare reimbursement  positive or negative  will impact the financial results of the company up to sixty days in advance of the effective date of such change  and the impact of a change could be material 
the base episode payment as shown above is adjusted by a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following a case mix adjuster consisting of home health resource groups hhrg  the applicable geographic wage index to give effect to geographic differences in wage levels  low utilization either expected or unexpected  intervening events  such as a significant change in the patient s condition and other factors 
the episode payment is also adjusted in the event that a patient is either readmitted by the company  or admitted to another home health agency  prior to the expiration of days from the original admission date these reimbursement adjustments are known as partial episode payments 
as a result  the actual payment to the company is different from the base episode payments listed above  but generally  a decrease in a base episode payment will result in a decrease in actual episode payment 
the episode payment will be made to providers regardless of the cost to provide care 
the services covered by the episode payment include all disciplines of care  in addition to medical supplies  within the scope of the home health benefit 
a portion of the cash reimbursement from each medicare episode is typically received before all services are rendered 
the estimated episodic payment is billed at the commencement of the episode 
medicare reimburses of the estimated reimbursement at the initial billing for the initial episode of care per patient and the remaining reimbursement is received upon completion of the episode 
medicare reimburses at initial billing for any subsequent episodes of care for a previously admitted patient immediately following the first episode of care for a patient 
the remaining reimbursement is received upon completion of the episode and upon final billing 
revenue is recorded as services are provided to a patient 
amounts billed and or received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
the amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million respectively 
these deferred revenue amounts have been recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet since only a nominal amount of deferred revenue represents cash collected in advance of providing services 
for episodes of care that are completed  all of the revenue expected to be received for that episode is recognized 
the amount of revenue recognized for episodes of care which are incomplete at period end is based on an estimate of the portion of the episode which applies to the period  and is calculated based upon total visits performed to date as a percentage of total expected visits for a particular episode 
management believes that this is a reasonable estimate for revenue with respect to services provided for incomplete episodes  and for which reimbursement will be ultimately received 
because of the potential for changes in base episode payments referred to above and the complexity of the regulations noted above  the estimated amounts originally recorded as net patient revenue and accounts receivable may be subject to revision as additional information becomes known 
during  cms informed home health care providers that it intended to make certain recoveries of amounts overpaid to providers for the periods dating from the implementation of pps on october  through particular dates in and the first of these amounts related to partial episode payments peps whereby a patient was readmitted to a home health care agency prior to the passing of days from the previous admission date at another home health agency 
in such instances  reimbursement for the first agency is reduced 
cms advised the industry that cms had implemented changes to its computer system such that the 
table of contents proper adjustment would be made at the time of claim submission on an ongoing basis  and that recovery for prior overpayments would commence in the summer of and extend over a two year period 
the company reserved  based on information supplied by cms  approximately million in for all claims dating from october  during the twelve months ended december   cms recouped approximately  of the above estimated overpayments 
the company cannot predict the actual timing of future collections initiated by cms 
secondly  cms advised the industry that it would seek recovery of overpayments that were made for patients who had  within days of such admission  been discharged from inpatient facilities  including hospitals  rehabilitation and skilled nursing units  and that these recoveries would commence in april this date was subsequently extended to cms will provide at least five weeks notice of any impending recovery 
to date no notice has been received by the company 
the company conducted an analysis of a representative sample of claims where and when these events had occurred  and estimated that  for all periods dating from october  through december   a reserve in the amount of approximately million was appropriate 
this reserve is recorded in current portion of medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
prior to the implementation of pps on october   reimbursement for home health care services to patients covered by the medicare program was based on reimbursement of allowable costs subject to certain limits 
final reimbursement was determined after submission of annual cost reports and audits thereof by the fiscal intermediaries 
retroactive adjustments have been accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services were rendered and will be adjusted in future periods  as final settlements are determined 
estimated settlements for cost report years ended and subsequent years  which are still subject to audit by the intermediary and the department of health and human services  are recorded in current medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
under the new pps rules  annual cost reports are still required as a condition of participation in the medicare program 
however  there are no final settlements or retroactive adjustments based on the submitted annual cost reports 
non medicare revenue recognition the company has agreements with third party payors that provide payments for services rendered to the company at amounts different from established rates 
gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the company s established rates or estimated reimbursement rates  as applicable 
allowances and contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between the established rates and the amounts estimated to be payable by third parties and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue 
net service revenue is the estimated net amounts realizable from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements 
reimbursement from all sources except medicare as noted above is typically billed and revenue is recorded as services are rendered and is based upon discounts from established rates 
hospice revenue recognition services are billed to medicare  medicaid and private payors generally on a daily basis 
the hospice locations are subject to limits for payments 
for inpatient services the limit is based on inpatient care days 
if inpatient care days provided to patients at a hospice exceeded of the total days of hospice care provided for the year  then payment for days in excess of this limit are paid at the routine home care rate 
overall payments made by medicare are also subject to a cap amount calculated by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of the hospice cap period 
the hospice cap period runs from november st of each year through october st of the following year 
total medicare payments during this period are compared to the cap amount for this period 
payments in excess of the cap amount must be returned to medicare 
the cap amount is calculated by multiplying the number of beneficiaries electing hospice care during the period by a statutory amount that is indexed for inflation 
the per beneficiary cap amount was  for the twelve month period ending october  the hospice cap amount is computed on a hospice by hospice basis 
any amounts received in excess of this per beneficiary cap must be refunded to medicare 

table of contents collectibility of accounts receivable the process for estimating the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable involves judgment  with the greatest subjectivity relating to non medicare accounts receivable 
the company currently records an allowance for uncollectible accounts on a percentage of revenue basis unless a specific issue is noted  at which time an adjustment to the allowance may be recorded 
in the year ended december   accounts receivable increased  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  to million from million at december  this increase was due to the increases in net service revenue of over referred to earlier  and to delays in billing associated with the previously discussed acquisitions  particularly with respect to the hospice acquisitions 
accounts receivable as at december  by payor class is as follows medicare  net of deferred revenue medicaid private total gross accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable net of doubtful accounts amounts receivable from state medicaid agencies and private insurers are significantly more difficult to collect  in particular  because all billing is done on a per visit basis resulting in a number of smaller accounts 
in late the company ceased servicing a number of private insurance companies as a result of these difficulties 
insurance and litigation reserves the company is obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including employee health and welfare  workers compensation and professional liability  and while the company maintains various insurance programs to cover these risks  it is self insured for a substantial portion of the potential claims 
in january  the company reverted to a high deductible worker compensation plan with a  deductible per claim and this continued for the policy year 
during these periods  the company elected to fund a deposit with the carrier for the purpose of ensuring timely payment of claims 
at december   the cash deposit was approximately equal to estimated claims outstanding in respect of the policy year 
at december   the cash deposited with the carrier for both the and policy years was not equal to the estimated claims for either year  and therefore  the company elected record the cash deposited as other assets  and the estimates for outstanding claims as accrued expenses insurance in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company maintained reserves at december  for worker s compensation claims incurred but not reported of million and million for the and policy years  respectively 
the company recognizes its obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims  and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on historical data  industry statistics  the company s claims experience and analysis provided by the company s insurance agents 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the company maintained reserves at december  for health insurance claims incurred but not reported of million for the fiscal year 
in the case of potential liability with respect to professional liability  employment  or other matters where litigation is involved  or where no insurance coverage is available  the company s policy is to utilize advice from both internal and external counsel as to the likelihood and amount of any potential cost to amedisys 
the 
table of contents company maintained reserves at december  for professional liability claims incurred but not yet reported of  at december  
this advice is reviewed regularly by both internal staff  and on a quarterly basis  the company s audit committee 
the company recognizes its obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims  and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on historical data  industry statistics  the company s claims experience and analysis provided by the company s insurance agents 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets in july  the fasb issued financial accounting standards statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas that was effective january  under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in particular  the company has allocated amounts ranging from to of the purchase price of its acquisitions to the value of non competition agreements  generally with a useful life of two to three years 
in the twelve months to december   the company amortized million associated with these agreements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement also supersedes certain aspects of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as previously required by apb additionally  certain dispositions may now qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
the company reviews goodwill and other intangible assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether impairment has occurred  and if so  what impairment charge would be appropriate 
income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability approach to measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company s deferred tax calculation requires management to make certain estimates about future operations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s principal source of liquidity is the collection of its account receivable  in particular under the medicare program 
the company s operating activities provided million in cash during the year ended december   whereas such activities provided million in cash during the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities in is primarily attributable to net income of million  non cash items such as depreciation and amortization of million  provision for bad debts of million  increase in accrued expenses of million  deferred income tax change of million offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million

management does not expect the final cost report settlements to all occur in the coming year 
in addition  when the cost reports are settled  the company is entitled to apply for a payment plan for up to five years in length 
there can be no assurance that such a payment plan would be granted if sought 
effective april   the company entered into a financing arrangement with ge healthcare financial services ge for a million working capital facility the ge facility  under which the company may request  under certain conditions  that the borrowing capacity under the ge facility be increased in two separate increments of million each  for a total borrowing capacity of million 
the company believes that it meets at december   all conditions necessary for increasing the borrowing capacity of the ge facility to million 
to date  no amounts have been drawn under this facility 
the company has certain other contingencies and reserves  including litigation reserves  recorded as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
that management may not be required to liquidate in cash during however  in the event that all current liabilities become due within twelve months  the company may be required to limit its acquisition activities  utilize its ge facility and or sell securities on unfavorable terms 
there can be no absolute assurance that such action may not be necessary to ensure appropriate liquidity for the operations of the company 
however  the company believes that its cash flows from operations combined with borrowing availability under its ge facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for the next months

prior to the implementation of pps on october   the company recorded medicare revenue at the lower of actual costs  the per visit cost limit  or a per beneficiary cost limit on an individual provider basis 
under the previous medicare cost based reimbursement system  ultimate reimbursement under the medicare program was determined upon final settlement of the annual cost reports 
the million remaining balance due medicare reflects the company s estimate of amounts likely to be assessed by medicare as overpayments in respect of prior years when medicare audits of the company s cost reports from through october  are completed 
at the time these audits are completed and final assessments are issued  the company may apply to medicare for repayment over a thirty six month or longer period  although there is no assurance that such applications will be agreed to if sought
