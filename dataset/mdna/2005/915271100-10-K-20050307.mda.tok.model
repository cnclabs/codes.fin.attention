these are included in the due in one to five years category on issue 
the borrower has the right to prepay the loan at any time 

table of contents asset quality performance of the entire loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by bank management and loan officers 
a number of factors regarding the borrower  such as overall financial strength  collateral values and repayment ability  are considered in deciding what actions should be taken when determining the collectibility of interest for accrual purposes 
when a loan  including a loan impaired under sfas no 
 is classified as nonaccrual  the accrual of interest on such a loan is discontinued 
a loan is classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectibility of principal or interest  even though the loan is currently performing 
a loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and unpaid interest accrued in prior years is charged against other expense 
interest received on nonaccrual loans is either applied against principal or reported as interest income  according to management s judgment as to the collectibility of principal 
loans are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current  has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time  and the ultimate collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt 
total cash basis  restructured and nonaccrual loans totaled million at december   million at december  and million at december  and consist mainly of commercial loans and real estate commercial loans 
for the years ended december   and  nonaccrual loans resulted in lost interest income of million  million and million respectively 
the corporation s ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate owned was as of december  and as of december  at december   the recorded investment in loans that are considered to be impaired under sfas no 
was million  all of which were on a nonaccrual basis 
the related reserve for loan losses for those loans was million 
nonaccruing loans increased during due to million in real estate commercial loans and million in commercial loans placed on nonaccrual status 
specific reserves of million have been established for these loans based on current facts and management s judgments about the ultimate outcome of these credits 
the amount of the specific reserve needed for these credits could change in future periods subject to changes in facts and judgments related to these credits 
increases in nonaccruing loans in were offset by million in charge offs  approximately million in paydowns  million in loans returned to accruing status and million in foreclosed loans carried in other real estate owned

at december   management is not aware of other potential problem loans that cause serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
in management s evaluation of the loan portfolio risks  any significant future increases in nonperforming loans are dependent to a large extent on the economic environment  or specific industry problems 
at december  there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans other than disclosed in table

management s methodology to determine the adequacy of and the provisions to the reserve considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions and trends  and the volume  growth  and composition of the loan portfolio 
the reserve for loan losses is determined through a monthly evaluation of reserve adequacy 
quarterly  this analysis takes into consideration the growth of the loan portfolio  the status of past due loans  current economic conditions  various types of lending activity  policies  real estate and other loan commitments  and significant changes in charge off activity 
non accrual loans are evaluated individually 
all other loans are evaluated as pools 
based on historical loss experience  loss factors are determined giving consideration to the areas noted in the first paragraph and applied to the pooled loan categories to develop the general or allocated portion of the reserve 
loans are also reviewed for impairment based on discounted cash flows using the loans initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans as provided under sfas no 
management also reviews the activity within the allowance to determine what actions  if any  should be taken to address differences between estimated and actual losses 
any of the above factors may cause the provision to fluctuate 
the reserve for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions and such other factors  which  in management s opinion  deserve recognition in estimating loan losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
additions to the reserve arise from the provision for loan losses charged to operations or from the recovery of amounts previously charged off 
loan charge offs reduce the reserve 
loans are charged off when there has been permanent impairment or when in the opinion of management the full amount of the loan  in the case of non collateral dependent borrowings  will not be realized 
certain impaired loans are reported at the present value of expected future cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  less costs to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent 

table of contents the reserve for loan losses consists of an allocated reserve and an unallocated reserve 
the allocated reserve is comprised of reserves established on specific loans  and class reserves based on historical loan loss experience  current trends  and management assessments 
the unallocated reserve is based on both general economic conditions and other risk factors in the corporation s individual markets and portfolios 
the specific reserve element is based on a regular analysis of impaired commercial and real estate loans 
for these loans  the specific reserve established is based on an analysis of related collateral value  cash flow considerations and  if applicable  guarantor capacity 
the class reserve element is determined by an internal loan grading process in conjunction with associated allowance factors 
the corporation revises the class allowance factors whenever necessary in order to address improving or deteriorating credit quality trends or specific risks associated with a given loan pool classification 
the corporation maintains a reserve in other liabilities for off balance sheet credit exposures that currently are unfunded 
table allocated  unallocated loan loss reserves the reserve for loan losses is made up of the allocated reserve and the unallocated portion 
the following table summarizes the two categories for the periods indicated 
at december  allocated unallocated total the million increase in the allocated portion of the reserve for the year ended december  was the result of a million increase in specific reserves  primarily on impaired real estate commercial loans  partially offset by a million reduction on homogeneous loan pools such as loans to individuals 
the reduction in homogeneous loans pool reserves were due to more favorable trends in recent historical loss experience and reserve methodology adjustments 
the million increase in the unallocated position is a result of the improved loan grade migration of the homogeneous loan pools 
analysis of unallocated adequacy is based on a stress testing model assessing loan grade migration as influenced by economic conditions and grading accuracy 
the total reserve for loan losses increased million for the year ended december  primarily due to the reserve acquired as part of the acquisitions of first county bank and suburban community bank which added million to the reserve 
the million increase in the allocated portion of the reserve for the year ended december  occurred as increased risk associated with the commercial loan portfolio more than offset lower risk identified for the retail loan portfolio 
the number of impaired credits increased year over year and the associated specific reserves increased million  almost entirely due to one commercial credit 
the favorable impact of commercial real estate loan grade migrations nearly matched additional allocation requirements related to weaker commercial loan portfolio quality 
retail loan allocations decreased primarily due to material improvement in past due and loss experience 
the million reduction in the unallocated position reflects unfavorable loan grade migration of the commercial portfolio 
management believes that both the allocated and unallocated portions of the reserve are maintained at a level that is adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio

there is a buyback program in place which as of december  allows the corporation to purchase an additional  shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions 

table of contents accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt securities is primarily the difference between the book value and market value of the available for sale investment portfolio 
the year to year decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income was caused by the decline in the portfolio yield as a result of debt securities maturing  being called  or sold 
as these securities were replaced with new securities purchased at market rates  the difference between the book value and market value of this portfolio declined 
additionally during  available for sale debt and equity securities  primarily fixed rate us government agency mortgage backed securities  totaling approximately million were sold for a net gain of million

critical accounting policies management  in order to prepare the corporation s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  is required to make estimates and assumptions that effect the amounts reported in the corporation s financial statements 
there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions 
certain critical accounting policies  discussed below  could materially affect the results of operations and financial position of the corporation should changes in circumstances require a change in related estimates or assumptions 
the corporation has identified the reserve for loan losses  intangible assets  investment securities  mortgage servicing rights  income taxes and benefit plans as its critical accounting policies 
reserve for loan losses are provided using techniques that specifically identify losses on impaired loans  estimate losses on pools of homogeneous loans  and estimate the amount of unallocated reserve necessary to account for losses that are present in the loan portfolio but not yet currently identifiable 
the adequacies of these reserves are sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may affect the ability of borrowers to make contractual payments as well as the value of the collateral committed to secure such payments 
rapid or sustained downturns in the economy may require increases in reserves that may negatively impact the corporation s results of operation and statements of financial condition in the periods requiring additional reserves 
intangible assets have been recorded on the books of the corporation in connection with its acquisitions of first county bank  pennview savings bank  suburban community bank  univest investments  inc and univest insurance  inc these assets  both identifiable and unidentifiable  are subject to tests for impairment 
changes in the useful life or economic value of acquired assets may require a reduction in the asset value carried on the financial statements of the corporation and a related charge in the statement of operations 
such changes in asset value could result from a 
table of contents change in market demand for the products or services offered by an acquired business or by reductions in the expected profit margins that can be obtained through the future delivery of the acquired product or service line 
sfas no 
 which took effect january   defines the methods that are acceptable for determining whether intangible asset values are sustainable 
the corporation designates its investment securities as held to maturity  available for sale or trading in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
each of these designations affords different treatment in the statement of operations and statement of financial condition for market value changes effecting securities that are otherwise identical 
should evidence emerge that indicates that management s intent or ability to manage the securities as originally asserted is not supportable  securities in the held to maturity or available for sale designations may be re categorized so that either statement of financial position or statement of operations adjustments may be required 
the corporation accounts for mortgage servicing rights for mortgages it originated but subsequently sold in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fas no 
as such  the value of the rights is booked as income when the corresponding mortgages are sold 
the income booked at sale is the estimated present value of the cash flows that will be received from servicing the loans over the entire future term 
the term of a servicing right can be reasonably estimated using prepayment assumptions of comparable assets priced in the secondary market 
as mortgage rates being offered to the public decrease  the life of loan servicing rights tends to shorten  as borrowers have increased incentive to refinance 
shortened loan servicing lives require a change in the value of the servicing rights that have already been recorded to be marked down in the statement of operations of the servicing company 
this may cause a material change in reported operations for the corporation depending on the size of the servicing portfolio and the degree of change in the prepayment speed of the type and coupon of loans being serviced 
the corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities under the liability method of fas enacted tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on expected taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is anticipated to be realized 
future tax rate changes could occur that would require the recognition of income or expense in the statement of operations in the period in which they are enacted 
deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if in management s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset will not be realized 
management may need to modify their judgments in this regard from one period to another should a material change occur in  the business environment  tax legislation  or in any other business factor that could impair the corporation s ability to benefit from the asset in the future 
the corporation has a retirement plan that it provides as a benefit to employees and former employees and supplemental retirement plans that it provides as a benefit to certain current and former executives 
determining the adequacy of the funding of these plans may require estimates of future salary rate increases  of long term rates of investment return  and the use of an appropriate discount rate for the obligation 
changes in these estimates and assumptions due to changes in the economic environment or financial markets may result in material changes in the corporation s report of operation or statement of financial condition 
readers of the corporation s financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the corporation s current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances  business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the corporation at that time 
asset liability management the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate earnings  capital and liquidity while maintaining an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest 
table of contents bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet cash flow requirements of customers and corporate needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing rates 
the corporation uses both an interest sensitivity gap analysis and a simulation model to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk 
the corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure the short term rate exposures 
the corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the effect of declining or rising interest rates on the net interest margin over a one year horizon 
the simulation uses existing portfolio rate and repricing information  combined with assumptions regarding future loan and deposit growth  future spreads  prepayments on residential mortgages  and the discretionary pricing of non maturity assets and liabilities 
the corporation had used interest rate swap agreements that convert a portion of its floating rate commercial loans to a fixed rate basis 
in these swaps  the corporation agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest rates calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount 
interest rate swaps in which the corporation pays a floating rate and receives a fixed rate are used to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the corporation s net interest income 
at december  the corporation had no swaps outstanding 
at december   the total notional amount of pay floating  receive fixed swaps outstanding was million 
the net payable or receivable from interest rate swap agreements is accrued as an adjustment to interest income 
the million in notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at december  expired on january  there was no material impact of interest rate swaps on net interest income for the year ended december  the impact of the interest rate swaps on net interest income for the year ended december  was a positive million 
the corporation s credit exposure on swaps is limited to the value of interest rate swaps that have become favorable to the corporation 
as of december   the market value of interest rate swaps in a favorable position was thousand and there were no interest rate swaps with a market value in an unfavorable position 
credit risk exists because the counterparty to a derivative contract with an unrealized gain might fail to perform according to the terms of the agreement 
credit risk extending credit exposes the corporation to credit risk  which is the risk that the principal balance of a loan and any related interest will not be collected due to the inability of the borrower to repay the loan 
the corporation manages credit risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to consistent standards  guidelines and limitations established by the board of directors 
written loan policies establish underwriting standards  lending limits and other standards or limits as deemed necessary and prudent 
the loan review department conducts ongoing  independent reviews of the lending process to ensure adherence to established policies and procedures  monitors compliance with applicable laws and regulations  provides objective measurement of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and ensures that proper documentation exists 
the corporation focuses on both assessing the borrower s capacity and willingness to repay and on obtaining sufficient collateral 
commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by the borrower s assets and by personal guarantees 
commercial real estate loans are originated primarily within the eastern pennsylvania market area and are secured by developed real estate at conservative loan to value ratios and often by a guarantee of the borrowers 
management closely 
table of contents monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that significant credit concentrations by borrower or industry do not exist 
credit risk in the direct consumer loan portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to conservative underwriting standards that consider debt to income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower and  if secured  collateral values 
in the home equity loan portfolio  combined loan to value ratios are generally limited to 
other credit considerations may warrant higher combined loan to value ratios for approved loans 
the corporation originates fixed rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that are secured by the underlying to family residential properties 
credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower  including debt to equity ratios  credit scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan to value ratios of generally no more than 
residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan to value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance 
the corporation closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining high asset quality 
collection efforts begin after a loan payment is missed  by attempting to contact all borrowers 
if collection attempts fail  the corporation will proceed to gain control of any and all collateral in a timely manner in order to minimize losses 
while liquidation and recovery efforts continue  officers continue to work with the borrowers  if appropriate  to recover all monies owed to the corporation 
the corporation monitors delinquency trends and past due reports are submitted to the board of directors 
liquidity the corporation  in its role as a financial intermediary  is exposed to certain liquidity risks 
liquidity refers to the corporation s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demand for loans and deposit withdrawals 
the corporation manages its liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring its liquidity sources and estimated funding needs 
the corporation has a contingency funding plan in place to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution specific or a systemic financial crisis 
sources of funds core deposits and cash management repurchase agreements repos have historically been the most significant funding sources for the corporation 
these deposits and repos are generated from a base of consumer  business and public customers primarily located in bucks and montgomery counties  pennsylvania 
the corporation faces increased competition for these deposits from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  security dealers and others 
the corporation supplements its core funding with money market funds it holds for the benefit of various trust accounts 
these funds are fully collateralized by the bank s investment portfolio and are at current money market mutual fund rates 
this funding source is subject to changes in the asset allocations of the trust accounts 
the corporation  through the bank  has short term and long term credit facilities with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately million 
at december   outstanding borrowings under the fhlb credit facilities totaled million 
the maximum borrowing capacity changes as a function of qualifying collateral assets and the amount of funds received may be reduced by additional required purchases of fhlb stock 
the corporation maintains federal fund lines with several correspondent banks totaling million 
at december   there was million in outstanding borrowings under these 
table of contents lines 
future availability under these lines is subject to the policies of the granting banks and may be withdrawn 
the corporation  through the bank  has an available line of credit at the federal reserve bank of philadelphia  the amount of which is dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral 
at december   the corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this line 
cash requirements the corporation has cash requirements including various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments that require cash payments 
the contractual obligations and commitments table that follows presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties 
the most significant obligation  in both the under and over one year time period  is for the bank to repay its certificates of deposit 
securities sold under agreement to repurchase constitute the next largest payment obligation and it is short term in nature 
the bank anticipates meeting these obligations by continuing to provide convenient depository and cash management services through its branch network  thereby replacing these contractual obligations with similar fund sources at rates that are competitive in our market 
the table also shows the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of december  these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
commitments to extend credit are the banks most significant commitment in both the under and over one year time periods 
in  the corporation made investments in bank acquisitions requiring cash outlays of million 
these cash outlays to invest in income producing businesses are discretionary and may not be typical of the corporation s regular cash requirements 
contractual obligations and commitments the corporation enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and its asset liability management  to fund acquisitions and to meet required capital needs 
these obligations require the corporation to make cash payments over time as detailed in the table below 
the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to manage the corporation s exposure to fluctuation in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby and commercial letters of credit and forward contracts 
these financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contract or notional amounts of these financial instruments reflect the extent of involvement the corporation has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the corporation s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
unless noted otherwise  the corporation does not require and is not required to pledge collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk 
these commitments expire over time as detailed in table forward contracts represent agreements for delayed delivery of financial instruments or commodities in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver  at a specified future date  a specified instrument or commodity at a specified price or yield 
forward contracts are not traded on organized exchanges and their contractual terms are not standardized 
the corporation s forward contracts are commitments to sell loans secured by to family residential properties whose predominant risk characteristic is interest rate risk

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board revised interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the interpretation 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
application of this interpretation is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  as a result of the adoption of fin  the corporation deconsolidated its capital trust in the first quarter of the result was an increase in the junior debt of thousand 
in december  the financial accounting standards board revised statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r required that the fair value based method of accounting for stock options be used for all public entities and eliminates alternative accounting methods  consequently  similar economic transactions will be accounted for similarly 
entities are required to estimate the number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered as compared to the original statement which permitted entities to account for forfeitures as they occur 
in addition  sfas r amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
incremental compensation cost for a modification of the terms or conditions of an award is measured by comparing the fair value of the modified award with the fair value of the award immediately before the modification 
sfas r becomes effective for public entities that do not file as small business issuers  as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under the original statement will apply sfas r using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under the original statement for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  those entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by the original statement 
pro forma disclosures under the original statement are presented in footnote of the consolidated financial statements  herein 
the corporation does not anticipate recording expense significantly different than what is presented in footnote  although actual expense recorded in under the transition method will be approximately thousand which equates to six months of stock based compensation expense  net of allowable tax benefits 
future grants and unvested forfeitures of prior grants may alter this projected number 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
in the course of its lending and deposit taking activities  the corporation is subject to changes in the economic value and or earnings potential of these assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates 
the corporation s asset liability management committee almc manages interest rate risk in a manner so as to provide adequate and reliable earnings 
this is accomplished through the 
table of contents establishment of policy limits on maximum risk exposures  as well as the regular and timely monitoring of reports designed to quantify risk and return levels 
the corporation uses both an interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and a simulation model to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk 
the corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure the short term rate exposures 
the corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the effect of declining or rising interest rates on the net interest margin over a one year horizon 
the simulation uses existing portfolio rate and repricing information  combined with assumptions regarding future loan and deposit growth  future spreads  prepayments on residential mortgages  and the discretionary pricing of non maturity assets and liabilities 
the corporation is permitted to use interest rate swaps and interest rate caps floors with indices that correlate to on balance sheet instruments  to modify its indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on the corporation s current economic outlook 
the effect of the interest rate swaps that the bank uses to reduce its earnings volatility due to rate risk is also included in the results of the simulation 
at december   the simulation  based upon forward looking assumptions  projects that the corporation s greatest interest margin exposure to interest rate risk would occur if interest rates decline from present levels 
given the assumptions  a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve applied on a ramp down basis would cause the corporation s net interest margin  over a year horizon  to be approximately less than it would be if market rates would remain unchanged 
at december   the simulation  based upon forward looking assumptions  projects that the corporation s greatest interest margin exposure to interest rate risk would occur if interest rates decline from present levels 
given the assumptions  a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve applied on a ramp down basis would cause the corporation s net interest margin  over a year horizon  to be approximately less than it would be if market rates would remain unchanged 
policy limits have been established which allow a tolerance for no more than approximately a negative impact to the interest margin resulting from a basis point parallel yield curve shift over a forward looking month period
