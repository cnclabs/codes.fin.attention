table of contents force and marketing automation  and alert notification and web self help  for the delivery of consistent  quality customer care across multiple channels 
our customer care retention clients typically enter into longer term  contractual relationships that may contain provisions for early contract terminations 
we generally operate under month to month contractual relationships with our telesales clients 
the pricing component of a contract is often comprised of a base service charge and separate charges for ancillary services 
our services are generally priced based upon per minute or hourly rates 
on occasion  we perform services for which we are paid incentives based on completed sales 
the nature of our business is such that we generally compete with other outsourced service providers as well as the retained in house call center operations of our customers 
this can create pricing pressures and impact the rates we can charge in our contracts 
revenue is recognized as the services are performed  generally based on hours of work performed  however  certain types of revenue relating to up front project setup costs must be deferred and recognized over a period of time  typically the length of the customer contract 
results for included the following increased revenue  which grew compared to revenue 
significant growth in customer care and other inbound call center services 
we were awarded customer support programs in  and growth in our services revenue was 
continued expansion in our offshore operations  specifically in the philippines  where we opened our second contact center 
in the fourth quarter  our philippines operations handled of the company call volume as compared to in the fourth quarter of settlement of the shingleton litigation  which occurred in but is reflected  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  in our operating results for following four quarters of flat revenue rd quarter of through nd quarter of  strong growth resumed during the second half of the flat revenue was caused by the decline in domestic consumer telesales revenue offset by growth in services revenue 
as the domestic sales business stabilized  overall corporate revenue growth resumed 
we ended with two quarters of record revenue 
some of our key achievements in included completion of the deployment of our north american centralized technology infrastructure 
strengthening of our position in key vertical markets  primarily financial services and healthcare 
expansion of our presence in the telecommunications and technology markets and capturing our first government contract 
expansion of the scope of our marketing and technology services with ivr service offerings and introduction of business process outsourcing offerings  primarily back office data capture capabilities 
we improved our operations in due to our success in growing our client base  particularly in providing customer care management services in our key vertical markets  which often command higher revenue rates 
we were also successful in controlling our direct operating costs for labor and telecommunications 
the deployment of our centralized technology infrastructure helped us achieve savings in our telecom costs and increase the utilization of our workstations and software licenses 
on march   we announced a settlement to resolve the shingleton litigation 
under the terms of the settlement  ict  without admitting liability or wrongdoing  agreed to pay million to settle all allegations relating to unpaid wages  bonuses and other claims  as well as payments for liquidated damages required by the wage act 
our expenses relating to this litigation in were approximately million and includes legal costs incurred in as well as the additional amounts necessary to increase the settlement amount  offset by insurance proceeds of million 
see item of this annual report on form k 
our future profitability will be impacted by  among other things  our ability to expand our service offerings to existing customers as well as our ability to obtain new customers especially within the vertical markets where we have had the most success  including the financial services industry and healthcare industry 
we also 
table of contents need to continue to explore and grow new vertical markets 
our profitability is also impacted by our ability to manage costs and mitigate the effects of foreign currency exchange risk 
our business is very labor intensive and consequently  in an effort to reduce costs and be as competitive as possible in the marketplace  we have been reallocating some of our services to near shore and offshore contact centers  which typically have lower labor costs 
in  we opened a second contact center in the philippines 
we now have more than  workstations in the philippines 
some of these benefits  however  are offset by the expanded training and associated costs we may incur because of our service mix 
many of our customer care services require more complex and costly training processes and to the extent we cannot bill these amounts to our clients  our profitability will be impacted 
in addition to the more complex training  the employees who work on our customer care programs are generally paid a higher hourly rate because of the more complex level of services they are providing 
we believe that our success in will be largely dependent on our ability to continue capturing new marketing and customer service contracts  maintaining stabilized sales revenue and leveraging the investment we have made in our infrastructure by expanding our business service offerings 
we believe that major corporations will continue to leverage the skills of companies like ours and that the services outsourced will continue to expand beyond the contact center services that currently comprise the large majority of our business 
we plan to leverage our existing strength in the financial services  insurance and healthcare markets and provide additional business services to our customers in these industries 
to capitalize on these opportunities  we will continue to enhance the technologies we use 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue as services are performed  generally based on hours of work incurred 
revenue is typically calculated based on contracted hourly rates with customers 
in order to provide our business services solutions  we may incur certain up front project set up costs specific to each customer contract 
in certain instances  we can bill the customer for these costs  however  because the delivered item project set up costs does not have stand alone value to the customer  revenue is deferred and recognized as services are provided over the contract term or until contract termination  should that occur prior to the end of the contract term 
to the extent we have billed these costs and there are no customer issues with collection  we will defer the project set up costs and amortize such amounts as the services are provided over the remaining contract term or until contract termination 
the costs incurred are deferred only to the extent of the amounts billed 
amounts collected from customers prior to the performance of services are also recorded as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the deferred revenue related to up front project set up costs was million and  as of december  and  respectively 
the deferred cost associated with this revenue is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the deferred costs totaled million and  at december  and  respectively 
we believe our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition of financial statements and emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the company adopted eitf issue prospectively for arrangements entered into beginning july  the adoption of eitf issue did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts 
management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical write off experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
other items considered in estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts include the age of the receivables  the financial status of our customers and general economic conditions 
while we believe the reserve estimate to be appropriate  it may be necessary to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if actual bad debt expense exceeds the estimated reserve 
we are subject to concentration risks as certain of our customers  as well as certain of the industries we support  generate a high percentage of our total revenue and corresponding receivables 
accounts receivables as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
given the significance of accounts receivable to our consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets is used to measure 
table of contents recoverability 
some of the more important factors we consider include our financial performance relative to our expected and historical performance  significant changes in the way we manage our operations  negative events that have occurred  and negative industry and economic trends 
if any impairment is indicated  measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the assets  generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
impairment charges totaling approximately  were recognized as part of the million restructuring charge recorded in the year ended december  for the year ended december   additional impairment charges of  were recognized 
for the year ended december   no impairment charges were incurred 
net property and equipment as of december  and december  totaled million and million  respectively  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are recorded through business combinations 
as of december  and  we had million and million of goodwill and  and  of other intangible assets  respectively 
an impairment of these assets could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
an impairment exists when events have occurred or circumstances exist that would cause the fair value of these assets to fall below their carrying value 
although goodwill is no longer required to be amortized  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill 
this impairment review is performed in the fourth quarter of each year 
the impairment assessment is performed using our historical and projected cash flows 
on an interim basis  we also evaluate whether any events have occurred or whether any circumstances exist that could indicate an impairment of our goodwill 
for the years ended december  and  there were no impairment charges taken against goodwill and other intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income 
a portion of our deferred tax asset relates to net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes 
we do not believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded against these assets 
at december   some of our non us subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes of approximately million that do not expire 
these net operating loss carryforwards are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as deferred tax assets of million 
based on a detailed analysis performed by management  it was determined that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of the deferred tax assets associated with these net operating losses 
accordingly we recorded a valuation allowance of  against these deferred tax assets 
additionally  we have recorded as a deferred tax asset as of december  approximately million of federal tax credits 
because we do not believe we will be able to realize all of these credits  we have recorded a valuation allowance of  against them 
although realization is not assured with our deferred tax assets  management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
we will continue to evaluate and assess the realizability of all deferred tax assets and adjust valuation allowances  if required in the future 
restructuring charges as of december   we had a remaining accrual of million for the amount of estimated costs required to terminate the leases and close the facilities included in the december restructuring 
the original charge of million consisted of severance  site closure costs and asset impairments 
certain estimates were made in determining the amount of the charge for site closure costs and asset impairments  but no estimate for sublease income was made  given the market conditions at that time and the inability to find suitable tenants 
the amount of the charge will be subject to change over time if a suitable tenant is identified or to the extent we are able to negotiate early lease terminations 
in  the only activity in the accrual were payments of million for the ongoing lease obligations and severance payments of  
table of contents accounting for contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships  or from our relationships with our employees 
management accounts for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires an estimated loss contingency be recorded when information available prior to issuance of a company s financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
sfas no 
and its interpretations further states that when there is a range of loss and no amount within that range is a better estimate than any other  that the minimum amount in the range shall be accrued 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  the accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
as of december   accruals for loss contingencies  excluding estimated legal fees to defend currently pending matters  totaled million and are included in accrued litigation costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the contingency relates to an ongoing lawsuit filed in by a former employee  william shingleton 
on march   we announced a settlement with the plaintiffs to this litigation 
under the terms of the settlement  ict  while continuing to dispute the plaintiffs allegations and without admitting liability or wrongdoing  agreed to pay million to the plaintiff class to settle all allegations relating to unpaid wages  bonuses and other claims  as well as potential payments for liquidated damages allowed by west virginia law of thirty days pay plus interest  which was being sought for all class members regardless of the amount of wages allegedly unpaid 
because this settlement was a subsequent event  which occurred prior to the release of our financial statements and form k filing and provided additional evidence on a matter that existed at the balance sheet date  we have reflected the financial outcome of this settlement in our consolidated financial statements as of december  prior to this settlement  our litigation accrual for this matter had been million 
with the impact of this settlement considered  our accrual was adjusted to million 
our accrual reflects the settlement amounts to be paid by ict and associated payroll taxes

total revenue per average workstation increased by  reflecting a growing mix of services revenue  which typically has greater workstation utilization as compared to sales revenue 
sales revenue has declined for the last two years  however  since the sharp decline in mid caused by the enactment of federal legislation  our quarterly sales revenue has maintained consistent levels 
although revenue in declined very slightly from  there was a significant change in the mix of client programs to the extent that the increase in services revenue of million almost fully offset the decline 
table of contents in sales revenue 
sales revenue declined million in  largely due to a slowdown in domestic telemarketing activity resulting from legislation enacted in by the federal communications commission and the federal trade commission 
the increase in services revenue of million reflects the investments we made to take advantage of the growing trend of businesses to outsource their customer care requirements 
revenue per average workstation declined in from by approximately  which was partially due to the underutilization of workstations at our contact centers where we run programs that generate sales revenue 
additionally  in we began moving more production to lower priced and lower cost offshore and near shore locations 
as we continue to perform work for our customers in offshore and near shore locations  our revenue will be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

the effective rate benefit in was impacted by higher losses in the united states due to the additional litigation charge recorded during as well as  of work opportunity tax credits that we earned 

table of contents quarterly results and seasonality we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in our operating results  principally as a result of the timing of client programs particularly programs with substantial amounts of upfront project setup costs  the commencement and expiration of contracts  the timing and amount of new business we generated  our revenue mix  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to support the growth and development of existing and new business units  competitive industry conditions and litigation costs 
historically  our business tends to be strongest in the fourth quarter due to the high level of client sales and service activity for the holiday season 
the fourth quarter of  however  was impacted by the settlement of the shingleton litigation 
our fourth quarter results reflect  of expenses related to the settlement of the shingleton litigation  net of known insurance proceeds of  during the first quarter  our business generally levels off or slows from the previous quarter as a result of reduced client sales and service activity 
historically  we have expanded our operations in the first quarter to support anticipated business growth in the second quarter 
in the past  demand for our business typically slowed or decreased in the third quarter as the volume of business decreased during the summer months 
in addition  our operating expenses typically increased during the third quarter in anticipation of higher demand during the fourth quarter 
however  more recently  we have experienced quarterly fluctuations in the business as a result of other factors  such as the timing of the demand for the particular services we offer in the specific geographic areas we serve  as well as the increasing portion of our business coming from service programs  which generally have less seasonality than sales programs 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities as compared to million at december  the short term marketable securities are not considered cash equivalents because of their stated maturities  however  we do consider them to be liquid because of our ability to buy and sell the securities in secondary markets 
we generate cash through various means  primarily through cash from operations and  when required  through borrowings under our revolving credit facility the credit facility 
the primary areas of our business in which we spend cash include capital expenditures  payments of principal and interest on amounts owed under our credit facility  costs of operations  litigation defense and business combinations 
cash from operations cash provided by operations in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash from operations in was generated by a net loss of million  which was offset by non cash expenses of million  primarily depreciation and amortization  and increased litigation accruals of million 
the additional litigation accrual is associated with the shingleton settlement 
changes in working capital  exclusive of the increased litigation accrual  accounted for a million decrease in cash flow from operations and was driven primarily by an increase in accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable increased because of the significant growth in revenue in the fourth quarter of much of the cash associated with these fourth quarter receivables was collected in january and february of cash from operations in was generated by a net loss of million  offset by non cash expenses of million  primarily depreciation and amortization 
net working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by  the reduction in working capital changes was primarily due to million of restructuring payments made in  partially offset by increased collections of accounts receivable 
cash from operations in was generated primarily through net income of million along with a million benefit from non cash expenses  primarily depreciation and amortization 
net income in reflected the million restructuring charge  however  there were no restructuring payments made until these items were partially offset by declines in working capital of million 

table of contents credit facility in  and  we had net borrowings of million  million and million  respectively 
the primary use of these borrowings was to fund a portion of our capital expenditures each year 
additionally  in  borrowings under our credit facility were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of dps data group llc dps 
we paid approximately million   and  of interest expense against amounts outstanding for each of those years 
in december  we renewed the credit facility  which now expires in december the commitment includes sub limits for both foreign denominated loans and letters of credit 
the agreement has two borrowing options  either a base rate option  defined as the higher of federal funds plus or prime  plus a spread ranging from to or a eurocurrency rate option  defined as libor plus a spread ranging from to  depending on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda net income before interest expense  interest income  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from to of the unused amount 
the agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified levels of consolidated leverage  consolidated fixed charges  and minimum net worth 
as a result of the new credit facility  we paid  of issuance costs in that  for accounting purposes  were deferred and are being amortized over the three year term of the agreement 
the unamortized issuance costs associated with the original credit facility were  and are also being amortized over the new three year term 
on july   we signed an amendment to the credit facility 
the purpose of the amendment was to increase the aggregate commitment to million through the addition of a new participating lender 
we are in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility as of december  on january   we amended the credit facility to revise the definition of consolidated ebitda such that any non cash accruals and cash payments made by the company during  not exceeding million in the aggregate  relating to or in settlement of the shingleton class action litigation see note  shall be added back to consolidated net income as defined in the credit agreement for the purpose of calculating consolidated ebitda under the credit agreement 
this amendment will allow us to remain in compliance with its covenants upon payment of the shingleton settlement 
litigation we have spent significant resources defending the company in the current class action and related litigation 
our associated legal costs in  and  were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
on march   we announced a settlement with the plaintiffs to this litigation 
under the terms of the settlement  ict  while continuing to dispute the plaintiffs allegations and without admitting liability or wrongdoing  agreed to pay million to the plaintiff class to settle all allegations relating to unpaid wages  bonuses and other claims  as well as payments for liquidated damages allowed by west virginia law of thirty days pay plus interest  which was being sought for all class members regardless of the amount of wages allegedly unpaid 
because this settlement was a subsequent event that occurred prior to the release of our financial statements and form k filing and provided additional evidence on a matter that existed at the balance sheet date  we have reflected the financial outcome of this settlement in our consolidated financial statements as of december  our accrual at december  is now million 
we expect to fund this settlement partially with cash on hand and partially with borrowings under our credit facility 
we have made arrangements with our lenders that would allow us to satisfy the settlement completely with additional borrowings  however  we do not anticipate that will be necessary 
our accrual reflects the settlement amounts to be paid by us along with associated payroll taxes 
we sought insurance coverage for part of the damages in this litigation under directors and officers policies that were in effect with two insurers 
one of the insurers agreed to pay million toward the settlement and that amount was recorded against litigation costs in our consolidated statement of operations 
this amount is recorded as a receivable within prepaid expenses and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  
table of contents we continue to pursue a pending lawsuit against the other insurer  seeking to recover the million policy limits and attorneys fees and costs 
in that litigation  the court has issued rulings favorable to us  including rejecting the two primary defenses of that insurer 
if we are successful in recovering payments from this insurer  the amounts recovered would be recognized in the period received 
capital expenditures and business combinations in  we spent million on capital expenditures as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
for each year  these amounts represented the vast majority of our investing activities 
in  we added a net total of workstations at our contact centers in the us and abroad 
in  new workstations were established in the philippines  where we opened our second contact center 
in  we spent million less on capital expenditures than we spent in our spending was curtailed in as we completed our restructuring that was begun in in  a net total of workstations were added across our contact centers  compared to a net  workstations added in this reflects the elimination of workstations during  primarily through the restructuring that occurred at the end of there were  workstations in operation at december  compared to  workstations at december  and  at december  in addition to capital expenditures  we spent million   and million in  and  respectively on business combinations 
in april  we acquired the assets of dps data group llc dps for million 
this amount included approximately  of direct costs incurred for the transaction 
amounts paid in were related to additional amounts we paid for the assets of grupo teleinter  sa de sa  a contact center in mexico city  which was acquired in for million 
the amounts paid in were accounted for as additional goodwill 
in connection with the acquisition of dps  we agreed to pay the shareholders of dps additional consideration based on the achievement of specific financial goals for these goals were not achieved and therefore no additional amounts will be paid out under this agreement 
our operations will continue to require significant capital expenditures to support the growth of our business 
historically  equipment purchases have been financed through cash generated from operations  the credit facility  our ability to acquire equipment through operating leases  and through capitalized lease obligations with various equipment vendors and lending institutions 
we believe that cash on hand  together with cash flow generated from operations  the ability to acquire equipment through operating leases  and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures at least into commitments and obligations as of december   we are also parties to various agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
these obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources 
we expect to satisfy our contractual obligations through cash flows generated from continuing operations 
we would also consider accessing capital markets to meet our needs  although we can make no assurances that this type of financing would be available when we might need it 
the tables noted below present a summary of these obligations and commitments contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period description total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases telephone contract commitments credit facility total contractual obligations includes facility and equipment operating leases  some of which call for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent 
these obligation amounts include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statements of cash flows 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 and will require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas no 
r requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective for periods beginning after june  public companies are required to adopt the new standard using a modified prospective method and may elect to restate prior periods using the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  companies are required to record compensation cost for new and modified awards over the related vesting period of such awards prospectively and record compensation cost prospectively for the unvested portion  at the date of adoption  of previously issued and outstanding awards over the remaining vesting period of such awards 
no change to prior periods presented is permitted under the modified prospective method 
under the modified retrospective method  companies record compensation costs for prior periods retroactively through restatement of such periods using the exact pro forma amounts disclosed in the companies footnotes 
also  in the period of adoption and after  companies record compensation cost based on the modified prospective method 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged 
the guidance in that apb opinion no 
 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
to meet disclosure requirements  we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on our debt and other financial instruments 
information provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that would be incurred under normal market conditions because  due to practical limitations  all variables other than the specific market risk factor are held constant 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit facility 
a change in market interest rates exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss but would not impact the fair 
table of contents market value of the related underlying instrument 
borrowings under our credit facility are subject to variable libor or prime base rate pricing 
accordingly  a change basis points in the libor rate and the prime rate would have resulted in interest expense changing by approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the rate on the million of outstanding borrowings at december  approximated market rates  thus  the fair value of the debt approximates its reported value 
in the past  management has not entered into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  we may consider these instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
foreign currency risk we have operations in canada  ireland  the united kingdom  australia  barbados  mexico and the philippines that are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of the foreign entities statements of operations from local currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
our most significant foreign currency exposures occur when revenue is generated in one foreign currency and corresponding expenses are generated in another foreign currency 
our most significant exposure has been with our canadian operations  where revenue is generated in us dollars usd and the corresponding expenses are generated in canadian dollars cad 
when the value of the cad increases against the usd  cad denominated expenses increase and operating margins are negatively impacted 
partially offsetting this exposure is indigenous canadian business and associated profitability where usd profits will be higher in a period of a strong cad 
in  management implemented a strategy to hedge a portion of anticipated operating costs and payables associated with the cad  primarily payroll expenses  rental expenses and other known recurring expenses  on a monthly basis to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the expansion of operations in the philippines has increased the level of currency exposure in that operation  however  the exchange rate of the philippine peso against the usd has historically not fluctuated significantly 
the impact of foreign currencies will continue to present economic challenges for us and could negatively impact overall earnings 
a change in the value of the usd relative to foreign currencies could have had an impact of approximately million and  on our annual earnings in and  respectively
