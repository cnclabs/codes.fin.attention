item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview calamp is a provider of wireless products and engineering services that enable anytime anywhere access to critical information  data and entertainment content 
calamp is the leading supplier of direct broadcast satellite dbs outdoor customer premise equipment to the us satellite television market 
the company also provides wireless connectivity solutions for the healthcare industry  public safety organizations  telemetry and asset tracking markets  enterprise class wi fi networks  and digital multimedia delivery applications 
the company s dbs reception products are sold primarily to the two us dbs system operators  echostar communications corporation and directv group inc  for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems 
the company sells its other wireless access products directly to system operators as well as through distributors and system integrators 
on april   the company completed the acquisition of vytek corporation vytek  a privately held company 
the acquisition of vytek was motivated primarily by the strategic goal of increasing the company s presence in markets which offer higher growth and profit margin potential  and diversifying the company s business and customer base beyond its current dependence on the two us dbs system operators 
concurrent with the acquisition of vytek  the company realigned its operations into a divisional structure 
the legacy operations of calamp  previously segregated into the satellite and wireless access business units  were combined together with vytek s products manufacturing business to form the new products division 
the operations of vytek  which are principally service oriented  comprise the company s solutions division 
revenue consists principally of sales of satellite television outdoor reception equipment for the us dbs industry  which accounted for of consolidated revenue in the fiscal year ended february  the dbs system operators have approximately share of the total subscription television market in the us in calendar  the size of the us dbs market is estimated by industry analysts to have grown by from million subscribers to approximately million subscribers at december  demand for the company s satellite television reception products is driven not only by the growth in the overall dbs subscriber base  but also by product upgrade cycles and subscriber churn 
churn  which is defined as subscribers whose service is disconnected for any reason  is an important factor driving demand for the company s satellite products because the outdoor reception equipment typically is not redeployed by the service provider when churn occurs 
average monthly churn in the us dbs market was approximately in calendar year given the average size of the us satellite television market of about million subscribers during calendar  this means that in calendar the aggregate churn amounted to approximately million subscribers 
the demand for the company s products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of orders from one of calamp s key customers in calamp s satellite products business and the company s ability  as well as the ability of its customers  to manage inventory  the rate of subscriber churn in the us dbs market  and the ability of the system operators to manage and reduce their churn rates  the rate of growth in the overall subscriber base in the us dbs market  the economic and market conditions in the wireless communications markets  calamp s ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the rate at which calamp s present and future customers and end users adopt the company s products and technologies in its target markets  and the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of the company s products 
for these and other reasons  the company s net revenue in fiscal may not necessarily be indicative of future years revenue amounts 
from time to time  the company s key customers significantly reduce their product orders  or may place significantly larger orders  either of which can cause the company s quarterly revenues to fluctuate significantly 
the company expects these fluctuations to continue in the future 
material opportunities for the company include increasing the company s market share for outdoor reception equipment in the us dbs market  expanding its presence in wireless industry market segments for both fixed and mobile wireless applications  and leveraging calamp s high volume manufacturing capabilities to gain production contracts with customers of the solutions division s product design and consulting engineering services 
the company s principal challenges include eliminating the operating losses in the solutions division and improving product division gross margins 
basis of presentation the company uses a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to february  which for fiscal years  and fell on february   february  and march   respectively 
in these consolidated financial statements  the fiscal year end for all years is shown as february for clarity of presentation 
fiscal years  and each consisted of weeks 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made include  but are not limited to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  product warranties  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and the valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for estimated bad debts based upon a review and evaluation of specific customer accounts identified as known and expected collection problems  based on historical experience  due to insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company s customer base is quite concentrated  with two customers accounting for of the company s fiscal sales 
changes in either a key customer s financial position  or the economy as a whole  could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the recorded allowance amount 
inventories the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values  inventory carrying amounts are written down 
in addition  the company generally treats inventory on hand or committed with suppliers  which is not expected to be sold within the next months  as excess and thus appropriate write downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of sales 
estimated usage in the next months is based on firm demand represented by orders in backlog at the end of the quarter and management s estimate of sales beyond existing backlog  giving consideration to customers forecasted demand  ordering patterns and product life cycles 
significant reductions in product pricing  or changes in technology and or demand may necessitate additional write downs of inventory carrying value in the future 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while it engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowance the deferred income tax asset reflects the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized if realization of such asset is more likely than not  based upon the weight of available evidence that includes historical operating performance and the company s forecast of future operating performance 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred income tax asset on a quarterly basis  and a valuation allowance is provided  as necessary 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its forecasts of income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred income tax asset to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
during fiscal year  the valuation allowance was reduced by  substantially all of which related to tax benefits associated with exercises of non qualified stock options in prior years and was therefore recognized by increasing additional paid in capital 
this reduction of the valuation allowance in fiscal year exhausted that portion of the valuation allowance that was related to tax benefits from option exercises 
during fiscal years and  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was further reduced by  and  respectively  which had the effect of reducing income tax expense by corresponding amounts in these respective years 
vytek  which was acquired by the company in april  has tax loss carryforwards and other tax assets that the company believes will be utilizable to some extent in the future  subject to change of ownership limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code and to the ability of the combined post merger company to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the benefits before the expiration of the applicable carryforward periods 
in the purchase price allocation described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements   was the value assigned to vytek s deferred tax assets  which is net of a valuation allowance of  at february  the company s net deferred income tax asset was  which amount is net of a valuation allowance of  if in the future a portion or all of the  valuation allowance at february  is no longer deemed to be necessary  reductions of the valuation allowance will decrease the goodwill balance associated with the vytek acquisition 
conversely  if in the future the company were to change its realization probability assessment to less than  the company would provide an additional valuation allowance for all or a portion of the net deferred income tax asset  which would increase the income tax provision 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill the company accounts for long lived assets other than goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
and certain sections of accounting principles board opinion no 
specific to discontinued operations 
sfas classifies long lived assets as either to be held and used  to be disposed of by other than sale  or to be disposed of by sale 
this standard introduces a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to address situations where alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
the company has adopted this statement  which has not had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
sfas requires  among other things  that an entity review its long lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
during fiscal years and  the company recorded impairment writedowns of  and  respectively  on property and equipment which had become underutilized due to increased outsourcing to contract manufacturers 
the company also adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets at the beginning of fiscal as a result  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subject to a transitional impairment analysis and is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
the test for impairment involves the use of estimates related to the fair values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated and is usually based on projected cash flows or a market value approach 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the goodwill of  that resulted from the vytek acquisition was apportioned on the basis of a valuation analysis between the company s products division and solutions division because both of these reporting units are expected to benefit from the synergies of this business combination 
this valuation analysis resulted in an apportionment of the vytek acquisition goodwill to the products division and the solutions division in the amounts of  and  respectively 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company tested its products division goodwill for impairment as of december   which indicated that there was no impairment as of that date 
the initial annual impairment test of the solutions division goodwill will be performed during the first quarter of fiscal using a testing date of april  based on its most recent financial projections  and specifically on the improving trend of operating results that the company expects for its solutions division in fiscal compared to fiscal as discussed further below under recent developments  at the present time the company does not believe that this fiscal first quarter impairment test will result in an impairment of the solutions division goodwill 
the company believes the estimate of its valuation of long lived assets and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because if circumstances arose that led to a decrease in the valuation it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
recent developments subsequent to february   the company experienced a significant reduction in orders from the us dbs service providers  which are the two key customers of its products division 
based on information obtained from these key customers  the company believes that the primary reason for the decline in orders is that these key customers are adjusting their inventory holding levels 
the company believes that this is a temporary situation and does not  in management s judgment  represent a fundamental shift either in its market share or the dbs industry as a whole 
the company expects that this decline in orders will adversely affect sales and results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal the company believes that its dbs business will improve in the fiscal second quarter as these two key customers reach their target inventory levels and resume normal ordering patterns 
the company expects that the solutions division s operating loss in the fiscal first quarter will be reduced significantly from the operating loss of million it incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of continuing actions that are being taken to eliminate the losses in this division 
it is a goal of the company to bring this business into operating profitability by the fourth quarter of fiscal results of operations  fiscal years through the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of sales represented by items included in the company s consolidated statements of income year ended february  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangibles in process research and development write off operating income other expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income the company s sales and gross profit by business segment for the last three years are as follows revenue by segment year ended february  segment of of of division s total s total s total products    solutions  total    gross profit by segment year ended february  segment of of of division s total s total s total products    solutions  total    the products division generates substantially all of its revenue from the sale of outdoor reception equipment for use with subscription satellite television programming services 
such products accounted for approximately  and of total products division revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the remaining portion of the products division revenue in these fiscal years was generated primarily from the sale of wireless access equipment 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue products division revenue in fiscal increased  or  over fiscal  primarily as the result of increased unit sales of dbs reception equipment  specifically lnbfs 
sales of dbs products increased during fiscal in part because the company began volume shipments of two new products in the fiscal third quarter in support of customers multi satellite and digital video recorder service offerings 
the increasing availability of high definition television programming and the introduction of set top boxes with integrated digital video recorders is driving demand for increasingly complex dbs outdoor reception equipment that the company supplies 
these latest generation satellite products typically have higher average selling prices than earlier generation dbs outdoor reception products 
the solutions division revenue in fiscal represents the service operations of vytek which was acquired effective april  the products manufacturing business of vytek is included in the products division 
gross profit and gross margins products division gross profit increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal approximately one half of the gross profit increase is attributable to the  increase in revenue in fiscal  and the remaining gross profit increase is attributable to the year over year improvement in the gross margin percentage 
the products division gross margin improved from in fiscal to in fiscal the gross margin improvement in fiscal is due mainly to the fact that the products division gross margin during fiscal was adversely affected by quarter to quarter volatility in ordering patterns from the company s two key customers 
this demand volatility required the company to make a rapid contraction in production capability in the fiscal first quarter  and a rapid expansion of production capability in the fiscal third quarter  all of which adversely affected manufacturing efficiencies and gross margins during fiscal fiscal gross profit and gross margin of the solutions division were  and  respectively 
during fiscal the company took action to improve the cost structure and gross margins of the solutions division  and management expects that gross margins of this division will be higher in fiscal see also note to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional operating data by business segment 
operating expenses consolidated research and development r d expense increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase in r d expense was primarily due to the inclusion of the operations of the solutions division formerly known as vytek in fiscal  which accounted for  or of the increase 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to increased salaries and temporary labor expense  increased incentive compensation expense  and increased workers compensation insurance expense 
consolidated sales and marketing expenses increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal substantially all of this increase is attributable to the inclusion of the solution division s operations in fiscal consolidated general and administrative expense increased from  last year to  this year 
the  increase is primarily explained by the inclusion of the solutions division s operations in fiscal  which accounted for  of the increase 
the remaining increase is attributable primarily to increased auditing and accounting fees  increased incentive compensation expense  increased legal expense  increased salaries and wages expense  increased recruiting fees  increased consulting fees  and the fact that the gain on sales of property and equipment  which is netted against g a expense  was  less in fiscal compared to fiscal amortization expense of intangible assets in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal this increase is attributable to the intangible assets arising from the acquisition of vytek in april the write off of in process r d of  in fiscal is also attributable to the vytek acquisition 
operating income operating income was  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
the increased profitability is attributable to the improvement in the satellite products portion of the company s products division  as discussed above under the headings revenue and gross profit and gross margins 
fiscal operating income of  is comprised of operating income of the products division of  an operating loss of the solutions division of  and unallocated corporate expenses of  the company has taken recent steps to reduce the losses of the solutions division by strengthening the sales and marketing organization  by reducing overhead costs  and by making a leadership change 
management is closely monitoring the performance of this business unit with the objective of achieving profitable results for the solutions division as soon as possible 
income tax provision during fiscal years and  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reduced by  and  respectively  which had the effect of reducing income tax expense by corresponding amounts in these respective years 
the effective income tax rate was and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in effective tax rate in fiscal is attributable primarily to the fact that the reduction in the valuation allowance in fiscal as a percentage of fiscal pretax income was significantly greater than the reduction in the valuation allowance in fiscal as a percentage of fiscal pretax income 
in addition  the company was able to utilize a greater amount of tax credits in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales substantially all of the company s satellite product sales consist of outdoor reception equipment for the us direct broadcast satellite dbs industry 
sales of satellite products increased  or  in fiscal from fiscal this increase resulted primarily from substantially higher customer orders in fiscal for the newer generation lnbfs  which have higher average selling prices compared to older lnbf products 
also  satellite product revenues in the second half of fiscal were depressed because of lower unit sales of lnbf products caused by a delay in obtaining customer acceptance of new product designs that were approved in the latter part of fiscal s third quarter 
a new lnbf product was introduced during fiscal which generated sales of million 
also  the number of units sold in fiscal for all other lnbf products was approximately higher than in fiscal  and the average selling price of these other lnbf products increased by approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal sales of non satellite products in fiscal declined by  or  from fiscal this decline resulted mainly because fiscal s revenue included several large sales that were nonrecurring 
gross profit and gross margins in fiscal  gross profit on sales of satellite products declined by  or  from fiscal  and gross margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal despite the fact that satellite product sales in fiscal were higher than in fiscal  the quarter to quarter volatility of sales in fiscal was extreme  ranging from a low of million in the first quarter and a high of million in the third quarter 
this volatility in fiscal sales  which resulted in similar volatility in manufacturing activity  was caused by rapid shifts in demand on the part of the two us dbs system operators 
this required the company to make a rapid contraction in production capability in the fiscal first quarter  and a rapid expansion of production capability in the third quarter  all of which adversely affected manufacturing efficiencies and gross margins 
also contributing to the declines in gross profit and gross margin for satellite products in fiscal were the effect of persistent competitive pricing pressures on certain satellite products and significantly higher freight costs incurred for the procurement of raw materials and subassemblies in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  included in satellite cost of sales for fiscal were asset impairment writedowns of  on property and equipment which had become underutilized due to increased outsourcing to contract manufacturers  and a lower of cost or market inventory writedown of  gross profit for non satellite products decreased  or  and gross margin for non satellite products decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in gross profit was primarily due to the year over year decrease in sales 
the decline in gross margin in fiscal was also attributable to the decrease in sales of non satellite products  which resulted in higher unabsorbed fixed overhead costs that are included in cost of sales 
operating expenses research and development expense decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decline in r d expense in fiscal is due in part to the cancellation  in the third quarter of fiscal  of a product development contract for broadband wireless application specific integrated circuits asics because the market timing for large scale deployment of this technology was considered to be uncertain in the near term future 
this cancellation resulted in a reduction of approximately  in outside service expense in fiscal also contributing to the decline in r d expense in fiscal was lower salaries expense due to staffing reductions 
selling expense decreased by  or  in fiscal to  from  in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the fact that bad debts expense for fiscal included a charge of  to write down the carrying amount of an available for sale investment in common stock that had been received in fiscal in satisfaction of an accounts receivable balance from a customer that went through a legal reorganization 
general and administrative expense increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the company s relocation of its facilities in ventura county  california during the fourth quarter of fiscal expense incurred in connection with this relocation amounted to approximately  non operating expense  net net non operating expense increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase in net non operating expense was primarily attributable to a decline in foreign currency gains from  in fiscal to  in fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate was and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decline in effective tax rate in fiscal was attributable primarily to the fact that  in fiscal  reductions in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance had a corresponding impact on the income tax provision 
prior to fiscal  reductions of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance were offset by increases in additional paid in capital  and accordingly the effective income tax rate in fiscal was not impacted by reductions in the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents  which amounted to  at february   and its million working capital line of credit with a bank 
during fiscal year  cash and cash equivalents increased by  this net increase consisted of cash provided by operating activities of  proceeds from sale of property and equipment of  and proceeds from stock option exercises of  less cash used for capital expenditures of  net repayments of debt of  and cash used in the vytek acquisition of  net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was  comprised of  net income of  after adjustment for non cash items of  reduced by cash used in operating working capital of  cash was used by an increase in operating working capital during fiscal in the aggregate amount of  comprised of a  increase in accounts receivable  a  increase in inventories  a  decrease in accounts payable  and a decrease of  in accrued liabilities  partially offset by a  decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the company believes that inflation and foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on its operations in fiscal the company believes that fiscal will not be impacted significantly by foreign exchange since substantially all of the company s sales are to us markets  or to international markets where its sales are denominated in us dollars 
at february  the company had a million working capital line of credit with a commercial bank that matures on august  borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at libor plus or the bank s prime rate  and are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at february   million was outstanding on this line of credit which is classified as long term at that date 
also at that date   was reserved under the line of credit for outstanding irrevocable stand by letters of credit 
the company also has two term loans with this bank that had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of  at february   as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the bank credit agreement that encompasses the working capital line of credit and the two bank term loans contains certain financial covenants and ratios that the company is required to maintain  including a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than  a current ratio of not less than  a leverage ratio of not more than  tangible net worth of at least  such minimum amount increasing by million annually beginning on march   cash and cash equivalents not less than million  and net income of at least in each fiscal year 
the company s bank credit agreement also prohibits payment of dividends without the prior written consent of the bank 
at february  and  the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the bank credit agreement contains a subjective acceleration clause that enables the bank to call the loans in the event of a material adverse change as defined in the credit agreement in the company s business 
based on the company s history of profitable operations and positive operating cash flow over the past five years  and based on the company s internal financial forecasts for the next year  the company does not believe it is probable that the bank will assert the material adverse change clause in the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations following is a summary of the company s contractual cash obligations as of february  in thousands payments due by period less contractual than obligations year years years total debt    capital leases operating leases     purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations     purchase obligations consist of obligations under non cancelable purchase orders  primarily for inventory purchases of raw materials  components and subassemblies 
the company believes that its cash on hand  its cash generated from operations and the amount available under its working capital line of credit  are collectively sufficient to support operations  fund capital equipment requirements and discharge contractual cash obligations
