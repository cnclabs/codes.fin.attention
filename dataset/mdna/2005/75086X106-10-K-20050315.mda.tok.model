factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in our other reports filed with the sec that attempt to advise interested parties of certain risks and factors that may affect our business

significant events and trends discussed in this management s discussion and analysis include significant pricing pressure that has negatively impacted  and is expected to continue to negatively impact  revenue  gross margins and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability  changes to accounting rules related to stock compensation expense that are anticipated to significantly affect our financial results in the second half of  a one time software license we entered into in  severance charges we incurred in  a change in accounting treatment for costs associated with the development of our next generation service  which commenced in the third quarter of  and restructuring charges and asset impairment charges we incurred in these significant events and trends have materially impacted  or are expected to materially impact  our business  operations and financial results 
some of these events result from unique facts and circumstances or one time events that may not recur 
while these items are important to understand and evaluate financial results  other transactions  events or trends discussed later in this management s discussion and analysis and in the section entitled risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock may also materially impact our business operations and financial results 
a complete understanding of these transactions  as well as the other events and trends explained throughout this report  is necessary to evaluate our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our quarterly and yearly operating results have varied significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly in future periods 
for example  our net loss was million and our net income was million for the quarters ended december  and  respectively  and our net loss was million and our net income was million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although we reported net income throughout the year ended december   we incurred net losses in each quarter of additionally  we expect to report net income in the first quarter of  however there can be no assurance that we will achieve or maintain net income in the future 
our stock based compensation expense will increase significantly beginning in the third quarter of due to a change in accounting rules that will require us to record compensation expense for employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan in the financial statements 
no single customer accounted for greater than of total revenue 
our five largest customers represented million or of our total revenue and million or of our total revenue 
our ten largest customers represented million or of our total revenue and million or of our total revenue 
this indicates a diminishing financial concentration in our five and ten largest customers  however  a loss of any one of these customers would still negatively impact our financial results 
in december we settled a billing dispute with a significant customer and vendor related to the provision and procurement of prior services which resulted in recognition of million in revenue and million in cost of revenue 
while our business model is largely usage based  which generally means that our customers only pay for the services they use  our non usage revenue  such as from subscriptions and software licenses  may fluctuate based on the timing of new subscription agreements  the expiration and renewal of existing agreements and the timing of and revenue recognition associated with software licenses 
this fluctuation can significantly impact our financial results  particularly revenue  gross margins and net income or loss because these subscriptions and software licenses have 
table of contents virtually no variable cost of revenue expense 
such opportunities to license our software have arisen infrequently and are difficult to predict  and currently we do not anticipate any software license revenue in the near term 
for example  we recognized million and million in software revenue in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  associated with the sale of a web conferencing pro license 
as a result  the impact this revenue has had on our business and financial results in the past is not consistent and should not be relied upon as indicative of our future performance 
in the quarter ended december   of our revenue was non usage based as compared to in the quarter ended december  in the year ended december   of our revenue was non usage based as compared to in the year ended december  we expect our non usage based revenue to approximate to of our total revenue in the first quarter of our next generation service  raindance meeting edition  was released in march raindance meeting edition revenue growth has been slower than anticipated and we believe this is due in large part to the small workgroup collaboration services sector being in the early adoption phase 
however  we continue to add new customers and revenue from this product is increasing quarter over quarter 
we expect to release raindance seminar edition in mid raindance seminar edition complements raindance meeting edition and is designed for large  planned seminar events where there is one main presenter and hundreds or thousands of participants 
currently  it is difficult to predict with any certainty the impact raindance seminar edition will have on our business  operations and financial results  the market in general  or our existing customer base including those that currently utilize web conferencing pro 
our gross profit is higher on our web based services  namely web conferencing pro and raindance meeting edition and to the extent we are successful in selling more web based services  we would expect our overall gross profit to increase 
we define multi media revenue as revenue generated from a collaboration event where more than one media type is used  such as an event that combines audio and web conferencing or an event that combines audio  web and video conferencing using raindance meeting edition 
multi media revenue excludes all service revenue attributable to audio only conferencing 
multi media revenue was million in compared to million in our gross profit margins are typically higher on multi media events  due to the web integration  as compared to audio only events and we expect our multi media revenue to grow as a percentage of revenue in the upcoming year 
statement of operations overview the following describes how we recognize revenue for the services and software we offered as of december  raindance meeting edition 
revenue for our raindance meeting edition service is derived from subscription and usage fees 
revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly regardless of usage  while usage fees are based upon either connections or minutes used 
we recognize usage revenue from our raindance meeting edition services in the period the meeting is completed 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
reservationless conferencing revenue 
revenue for our reservationless conferencing service is generally based upon the actual time that each participant is on the phone or logged onto the web 
for example  a customer is charged a per minute  per user fee for each participant listening and viewing a live or recorded simulcast 
in addition  we charge customers a one time fee to upload visuals for a phone conference or a recorded simulcast 
we recognize usage revenue from our reservationless conferencing services in the period the call or simulcast of the call is completed 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
web conferencing pro revenue 
revenue for our web conferencing pro service is derived from subscription and usage fees in addition to event fees or  in more limited cases  a software license fee 
revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly regardless of usage  while usage fees are based upon either connections or minutes used 
event fees are generally hourly charges that are recognized as the events take place 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from software license agreements is either recognized upon shipment of the software when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence is available for the fair value of all undelivered elements  or 
table of contents recognized ratably over the software support period if we do not have vendor specific objective evidence for all undelivered elements 
operator assisted revenue 
revenue for our operator assisted conferencing service is generally based upon the actual time that each participant is on the phone 
in addition  we charge customers a fee for additional services such as call taping  digital replay  participant lists and transcription services 
we recognize usage revenue and related fees from our operator assisted conferencing service in the period the call is completed 
unlimited conferencing 
revenue from unlimited conferencing is derived from a flat  fixed charge per month depending on the conference size limit selected by the customer 
the fixed monthly charge is recognized as revenue each month 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of telecommunication expenses  depreciation of network and data center equipment  amortization of certain software including internally developed software  internet access fees and fees paid to network providers for bandwidth  equipment maintenance contract expenses  compensation and benefits for operations personnel and allocated overhead 
our telecommunication expenses are variable and directly correlate to the use of our services and primarily are incurred when our customers use our reservationless conferencing service 
a change in our mix of reservationless conferencing and web conferencing pro or raindance meeting edition revenue will affect our gross profit  as our cost of revenue is typically higher on our reservationless conferencing service as a result of price compression for this service 
our depreciation  internet access and bandwidth expenses  equipment maintenance expenses and compensation expenses generally increase as we increase our capacity and build our infrastructure 
we plan to continue to make investments in our infrastructure  however  we currently expect capital expenditures in to be comparable with we expect that our cost of revenue will increase in due to a corresponding increase in revenue  but do not expect cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to change materially 
we expect that our current capacity and infrastructure  coupled with the capital expenditures we have made and we expect to make  will accommodate our needs through the end of we have a limited number of sources for our telephony services 
if one of our suppliers were to terminate or interrupt its services  we may experience difficulties or delays in obtaining alternative sources on commercially reasonable terms and may experience an increase in our variable telephony cost 
we are also involved in a dispute with our primary conferencing bridge provider that may require us to seek alternative sources for conferencing bridges  which may be difficult and expensive to integrate into our existing infrastructure 
we incur sales and marketing expenses that consist primarily of the salaries  commissions and benefits for our sales and marketing personnel  remote sales offices expenses  product and market research  sales lead generation and telemarketing expenses and allocated overhead 
we currently expect sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively flat in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue as we expand our sales force and continue our marketing initiatives in to support raindance meeting edition and the anticipated mid release of raindance seminar edition 
we incur research and development expenses that consist primarily of salaries and benefits for research and development personnel  equipment maintenance contract expenses and allocated overhead 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred  except for certain capitalized costs associated with internally developed software 
we capitalized million of internally developed software in and expect to continue to capitalize costs associated with internally developed software in based on plans developed in the third quarter of regarding the external distribution of software  we changed the accounting treatment of costs associated with the development of our next generation service from sop to sfas since the second quarter of we had capitalized  pursuant to sop  million in costs associated with our next generation service  million of which was related to internal development and million of which was related to contract development 
we currently expect to continue to make investments in research and development and anticipate that these expenditures will remain relatively flat in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue in we incur general and administrative expenses that consist primarily of expenses related to finance  human resources  administrative and general management activities  including legal  accounting and other professional fees  in addition to other general corporate expenses 
we currently expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat in terms of absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue in since our inception  we have used stock based compensation for employees  consultants and members of our board of directors to attract and retain business and technical personnel 
stock based compensation expense is 
table of contents based on the excess of the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant or sale over the option exercise price or stock purchase price 
compensation expense related to stock options is amortized over the vesting period of the options  which generally is four years 
as of may  all of these options with fair values deemed in excess of the exercise price were fully vested and therefore all associated stock based compensation expense has been recognized 
during the three months ended december  we did not record any deferred stock based compensation  however  during the year ended december   we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation 
we also expensed million and million of stock based compensation in the three months and year ended december   respectively 
the million of deferred stock based compensation for the year ended december  relates to the issuance of  shares of restricted stock to our new president and chief executive officer in january  of which  shares were immediately vested   shares vest after the completion of months of continuous service and  shares vest after the completion of months of continuous service 
this agreement was amended in august to include acceleration of all unvested shares of restricted stock in the event of a change in control of the company  as defined in the agreement 
in the year ended december  we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation related to  shares of restricted stock issued in february to certain executives and key employees under our executive performance based compensation arrangement  as approved by the board of directors in february the restricted stock will vest in full on the sixth anniversary of its issuance  subject to accelerated vesting upon the achievement of certain financial or product based performance milestones  or  generally at the board s discretion  upon a change in control of the company 
accordingly  the million deferred stock based compensation charge is being expensed ratably over six years  which charges will be accelerated when it becomes apparent that the financial or product based milestones are deemed probable of being achieved 
in addition  pursuant to this arrangement  million of cash compensation was approved and will become payable upon the achievement of such financial or product based milestones  or  generally in the board s discretion  upon a change in control of the company 
however  the termination of the company s former president and chief executive officer effective december  and the resulting cancellation of  shares of restricted stock granted to him under the plan triggered the reversal of the unamortized portion of his restricted stock grant compensation expense in the amount of million and terminated the company s million cash compensation commitment to this former officer 
in the first quarter of we determined that a product based milestone would likely be achieved in and  accordingly  we accelerated the stock compensation charge associated with  shares of restricted common stock and began accruing a million cash bonus 
in the first quarter of this milestone was achieved and the cash bonus of million was paid and the restricted stock was released and issued 
in the third quarter of we determined that a second product based milestone will likely be achieved in and  accordingly  we began accruing a million cash bonus payable upon the achievement of the milestone and accelerated the stock compensation charge associated with  shares of restricted common stock 
in connection with the acquisition of interact  we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation related to the issuance of  shares of common stock simultaneously with the closing of the interact acquisition 
the deferred stock based compensation related to these shares was being expensed over three years  beginning in may in june  our former senior vice president of sales  carolyn bradfield  left the company  and  as a result  we recorded a million stock compensation charge related to the unrecognized deferred stock based compensation associated with the release of certain escrowed shares of restricted stock 
the value of these escrowed shares was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over the three day period before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed upon and announced 
assuming that no additional shares of restricted stock will be forfeited or granted  assuming there is no change in control of the company  and excluding stock based compensation expense we expect to record as a result of adopting financial accounting standards board fasb r share based payment an amendment of fasb no 
and  we estimate incurring stock based compensation expense of approximately million in for common stock issued or awarded to our employees and members of our board of directors under our equity plans through december  other data non gaap financial measure we evaluate operating performance based on several factors  including our primary internal financial measure of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda 
this analysis eliminates the effects of considerable amounts of depreciation and stock based compensation 
since our initial public offering  we have reported adjusted ebitda  a financial measure that is not 
table of contents defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
certain restructuring charges and asset impairment charges historically presented in this non gaap financial performance measure have been removed from adjusted ebitda for to conform to the presentation of adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  and the calculation of adjusted ebitda is as follows in thousands years ended december  net income loss add depreciation  amortization and other income expense  net add stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda although we had achieved quarterly net income for five consecutive quarters ending december   we recorded net losses in each quarter of partially due to the increase in sales and marketing expenditures to support the release of raindance meeting edition 
our research and development costs also increased in over due to a change in accounting treatment of our software development costs 
additionally  our cost of revenue increased in primarily due to an increase in variable costs as a result of an increase in revenue 
for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   our net income decreased by million  resulting in a million net loss for the current year 
for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   adjusted ebitda decreased by million 
the trend from to depicted by this calculation indicates that we increased operating costs primarily in sales and marketing and research and development expenses for a new product launch and ongoing product development with the majority of these expenditures contributing to the net loss for and the corresponding decrease in adjusted ebitda 
for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   our net loss decreased by million  resulting in million in net income for for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   adjusted ebitda increased by million 
the trend from to depicted by this calculation indicates that we were successful in reducing our net loss and generating net income as well as increasing adjusted ebitda  primarily as a result of our efforts to control operating costs while simultaneously increasing revenue 
adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful performance metric for our investors and is a measure of operating performance and liquidity that is commonly reported and widely used by financial and industry analysts  investors and other interested parties because it eliminates significant non cash charges to earnings 
in addition  many sophisticated financial institutions and banks use adjusted ebitda as a performance metric in their lending practices 
for example  adjusted ebitda is used by our bank to determine our compliance with a financial covenant articulated in our credit agreement 
however  adjusted ebitda as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the funds depicted by adjusted ebitda were not available for our discretionary use due to debt service and debt maturities  all of which were satisfied in  and other commitments that we have made 
cash flow calculated in accordance with gaap is as follows net cash provided by operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was less than million for the year ended december   and net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due in part to the addition of new customers and an increase in usage from our existing customer base  which was partially offset by pricing pressure we 
table of contents are experiencing for some of our services  particularly our reservationless conferencing service and the loss of oracle corporation who accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in and reduced its use of our conferencing services as it completed the transition of substantially all of its conferencing to an internal conferencing system in the third quarter of we recognized million in revenue in associated with the sale of a web conferencing pro license 
opportunities to license our software have traditionally arisen infrequently and are difficult to predict 
we did not record any software revenue in and do not currently project software licensing revenue in total minutes attributable to our usage based services were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  which represents a increase in minutes 
usage based revenue increased by in from  which indicates that our average price per usage based minute declined by approximately or 
cents per minute in we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  telecommunications costs increased million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  due to an increase in minutes from our reservationless conferencing and web conferencing pro communication services  partially offset by an overall improvement in the utilization of our infrastructure 
total depreciation expense increased million for the year ended december  due to additional hardware and software being placed into service in  including the depreciation of capitalized costs in connection with the release of raindance meeting edition in march of expense associated with our operator assisted conferencing service increased million in the current year  which is consistent with growth in revenue from this service 
conversely  maintenance and repairs expense decreased million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the primary drivers that affect our gross profit are changes in our telephony and fixed internet costs and a general improvement in our infrastructure utilization  all of which are or may be partially offset by pricing pressure we are experiencing on the sale of our reservationless conferencing service 
in addition  our gross profit is higher on our web based services  namely web conferencing pro and raindance meeting edition and to the extent we are successful in selling more web based services  we would expect our overall gross profit to increase 
we define multi media revenue as revenue generated from a collaboration event where more than one media type is used  such as an event that combines audio and web conferencing or an event that combines audio  web and video conferencing using raindance meeting edition 
multi media revenue excludes all service revenue attributable to audio only conferencing 
multi media revenue was million in compared to million in our gross profit margins are typically higher on multi media events  due to the web integration  as compared to audio only events and we expect our multi media revenue to grow as a percentage of revenue in the upcoming year 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  bad debt expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of the on going quarterly analysis of the bad debt reserve 
commissions expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in connection with an increase in revenue in the current year 
personnel and payroll related expenses increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to increased headcount in as compared to expenses related to advertising and promotion  lead generation  market research and sales tools increased million  million  million  and million  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to an overall increase in marketing initiatives  some of which directly related to the release of raindance meeting edition which occurred in march additionally  trade show expenses  travel expenses and meetings and conferences expenses have each increased million year over year due to an overall increase in marketing and sales initiatives 
outside service expense increased million in the current year over the previous year due to consulting services utilized in connection with the sales organization restructuring 
offsetting these increases  depreciation expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  primarily due to fixed assets not specifically allocated to cost of revenue becoming fully depreciated 
research and development 
research and development expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  personnel and payroll related expenses increased million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  due to increased headcount in connection with the development of raindance meeting edition that was released in march  as well as a decrease in capitalized internally developed software 
similarly  outside services increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in personnel and payroll related expenses and outside services is primarily related to a change in 
table of contents the accounting treatment of costs associated with the development of raindance meeting edition from sop to sfas there was a slight variance in other expenses  including a million decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to fixed assets not specifically allocated to cost of revenue becoming fully depreciated 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  legal expenses decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to the accrual of a million loss contingency pertaining to a patent infringement suit in the third quarter of  which was subsequently paid in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of accounting expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to an increase in audit fees associated with the audit of internal controls over financial reporting required by sarbanes oxley 
outside services expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of consultants we engaged to assist us with our sarbanes oxley compliance effort and certain strategic initiatives 
there were slight fluctuations in other expenses  including amortization  bonuses  payroll  recruiting expense and allocated depreciation expense for the year ended december  as compared to the previous year 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  prior to our initial public offering  options and stock purchase rights were granted at less than the estimated initial public offering price resulting in deferred compensation charges  which were being recognized over the applicable vesting periods  which generally were four years 
as of may  all of these options were fully vested and therefore all associated stock based compensation expense has been recognized 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of deferred stock based compensation 
the million of deferred stock based compensation recorded in the first quarter of relates to the issuance of  shares of restricted stock to our new president and chief executive officer in january  of which  shares were immediately vested   shares vest after the completion of months of continuous service and  shares vest after the completion of months of continuous service

accordingly  the million deferred stock based compensation charge is being expensed ratably over six years  which charges will be accelerated when it becomes apparent that the financial or product based milestones are deemed probable of being achieved 
however  the termination of the company s former president and chief executive officer effective december  and the resulting cancellation of  shares of restricted stock granted to him under the plan triggered the reversal of the unamortized portion of his restricted stock grant compensation expense in the amount of million 
in the first quarter of we determined that a product based milestone would likely be achieved in and  accordingly  we accelerated the stock compensation charge associated with  shares of restricted common stock 
in the first quarter of this milestone was achieved and the restricted stock was released and issued 
in the third quarter of we determined that a second product based milestone will likely be achieved in and  accordingly  we have accelerated the stock compensation charge associated with  shares of restricted common stock

table of contents severance 
in october  we entered into a separation agreement with our former president and chief executive officer to terminate his employment as of december  pursuant to the terms of the separation agreement  we recognized approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to severance costs 
the unpaid severance commitment at december  was million 
in addition   shares of common stock issued to him in february under the executive performance based compensation arrangement were subject to forfeiture and were cancelled as of december   which triggered the reversal of the deferred portion of his restricted stock grant compensation expense in the amount of million 
in addition  a million cash compensation commitment allocated to our former president and chief executive officer under the executive performance based compensation arrangement was cancelled as of the termination of his employment 
other income  net 
interest income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   respectively  as interest rates increased in the latter half of and we began purchasing short term investments

total revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due in part to the addition of new customers and an increase in usage from our existing customer base  which was partially offset by pricing pressure we experienced for some of our services  particularly our reservationless conferencing service 
in addition  we first recognized significant revenue from our operator assisted conferencing service in the first quarter of we also recognized million and million in revenue in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  associated with the sale of a web conferencing pro license 
this license was entered into contemporaneously with our agreement to purchase million in hardware from the licensee  who is also our primary hardware vendor  through december opportunities to license our software have traditionally arisen infrequently and are difficult to predict 
total minutes attributable to our usage based services were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  which represents a increase in minutes 
usage based revenue increased by in from  which indicates that our average price per usage based minute declined by approximately or 
cents per minute in although this trend continued into  we saw pricing pressure at a reduced rate in the latter months of and in and therefore lowered our per usage based minute prices at a reduced rate  as discussed above 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  telecommunications costs increased million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  due to an increase in minutes from our reservationless conferencing and web conferencing pro communication services  partially offset by volume discounts received from our long distance telephony providers  as well as an overall improvement in the utilization of our infrastructure 
total depreciation expense increased million for the year ended december  due to additional hardware and software being placed into service in  partially offset by allocated depreciation due to decreased headcount over the same period in the previous year

maintenance and repairs expense increased million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in gross property and equipment 
the primary positive drivers that affect our gross profit are reductions in our long distance rates  a general improvement in our infrastructure utilization  the sale of subscriptions and software licenses with virtually no corresponding variable cost of revenue expense  all of which are or may be partially offset by pricing pressure we are experiencing on the sale of our reservationless conferencing service

the restricted stock grants vest in full on the sixth anniversary of their issuance  subject to accelerated vesting upon the achievement of certain financial or product based performance milestones  or in the board s discretion  upon a change in control of the company 
accordingly  the million deferred stock based compensation charge is being expensed ratably over six years  with such charges being accelerated when it becomes probable that the financial or product based milestones will be achieved 
however  the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer effective december  and the resulting cancellation of  shares of restricted stock granted to him under the plan triggered the reversal of the unamortized portion of his restricted stock grant compensation expense in the amount of million  as none of the acceleration milestones were achieved by this time 
in connection with the acquisition of interact  we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation related to the issuance of  shares of common stock simultaneously with the closing of the interact acquisition  which are being held in escrow and will be released annually in equal one third increments beginning in may accordingly  the deferred stock based compensation related to the  shares is being expensed over three years  beginning in may the value of these escrowed shares was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over the three day period before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed upon and announced 
asset impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we identified and removed from service equipment that was no longer required or had become obsolete 
the asset write offs were determined under the long lived assets to be disposed of by sale model 
for a discussion of the methodology used to determine the amount of the impairment charge under this model  see the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates below and the notes to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f we completed the sale and disposal of the assets in in connection with the plan of disposal  the carrying amount of the assets exceeded the fair value of the assets less cost to sell  and as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a reversal of million based upon revised estimates of the cash

severance 
in october  we entered into a separation agreement with our former president and chief executive officer to terminate his employment as of december  pursuant to the terms of the separation agreement  we recognized approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to severance costs 
in addition   shares of common stock issued to him in february under the executive performance based compensation arrangement were subject to forfeiture and were cancelled as of december   which triggered the reversal of the deferred portion of his restricted stock grant compensation expense in the amount of million 
in addition  a million cash compensation commitment allocated to our former president and chief executive officer under the executive performance based compensation arrangement was cancelled as of the termination of his employment 
restructuring charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we reassessed our cost structure and in december  our board of directors approved a plan of restructuring  which was announced in january in connection with this restructuring  we streamlined our operations to focus on our core web conferencing service offerings 
additionally  in connection with streamlining operations  we refocused our marketing strategy  reduced our workforce and closed several leased office facilities 
in connection with this restructuring we recorded restructuring charges of million and million in the first and second quarter of  respectively 
the actual cost savings we anticipated as a result of this restructuring effort have been realized with the exception of the restructuring costs associated with the closure of remote sales facilities 
due to the real estate market that existed  it took us longer than expected to sublease or otherwise terminate our lease obligations in certain cities 
we will continue to monitor and adjust  as warranted  the restructuring reserve associated with remote sales facilities based on current facts and circumstances 
other income  net 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was related to lower interest rates in compared to interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year december  the decrease was due to refinancing our outstanding term loan with a lower interest rate and a decreasing principal balance on which interest is calculated 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standard  accounting for income taxes 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which are available to offset future federal taxable income  if any  through we experienced an ownership change in as defined in section of the internal revenue code that limited approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to an annual usage of approximately million 
the balance of the net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million are not limited by section as of december  the availability of our net operating losses will be affected should we experience another ownership change in the future  as defined in internal revenue code section currently  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax asset 
we review our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis for realizability 
while we had generated net income for the five consecutive quarters ending december   we incurred a net loss in all four quarters of and believe there currently is not enough positive evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets 
when we determine there is enough evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will realize some or all of our deferred tax assets  we will reduce the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  which is anticipated to increase net income in the period in which such determination is made 
evidence to support a conclusion that our deferred tax asset is realizable includes  but is not limited to  generating net income in several consecutive quarters and projections for taxable income sufficient to utilize our deferred tax assets 
our net deferred tax assets at december  were million and we have established a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets

for example  we expect our results will fluctuate based on seasonal sales patterns  particularly around holidays and the spring and summer months 
accordingly  our operating results are difficult to predict 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results as indications of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  costs and difficulties frequently encountered by growing companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  such as the market for web conferencing services 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  an increase of million compared with cash and cash equivalents of million held as of december  net cash provided by operations was million  million and million for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by operations decreased in from cash provided by operations in primarily due to a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the decrease is also explained by an increase in accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable  accrued compensation  accrued severance obligation and the restructuring reserve partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase in deferred revenue

cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to debt service payments partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
as of december   we had no debt obligations outstanding 
effective december   we amended the terms of a loan and security agreement that we originally entered into on october  we renewed and increased the revolving line of credit and refinanced the term loan 
in connection with refinancing the term loan  the then outstanding balance was scheduled to be repaid with monthly principal payments of approximately million plus interest at over months  with the final payment due in january advances under the revolving line of credit were limited to million or of eligible accounts receivable as defined and adjusted in the agreement 
the revolving line of credit was available through january  advances under the revolving line of credit may have been repaid and re borrowed at any time prior to the maturity date 
the loan and security agreement was collateralized by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and was subject to compliance with covenants  including minimum liquidity coverage  minimum quick ratio and maximum quarterly operating losses adjusted for interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges 
we were also prohibited from paying any dividends without the bank s prior written consent 
in april  the balance due under this agreement exclusively related to the term loan of million was paid in full 
in addition  in may  we entered into a loan agreement with a vendor  in the amount of million  to finance certain fixed assets 
the loan was being repaid with quarterly principal payments of approximately million plus interest at with the final payment due in april in december  the balance due under this agreement of million was paid in full 
in april we entered into a credit agreement with another bank for a revolving line of credit  which expires in april outstanding advances under the revolving line of credit are limited to million 
advances under the revolving line of credit bear interest at below the bank s prime rate and may be repaid and re borrowed at any time prior to the maturity date 
at december   the company did not have an outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit  however million of the line of credit was securing letters of credit 
the credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and is subject to compliance with covenants  including minimum liquidity coverage  minimum tangible net worth and positive adjusted ebitda defined as quarterly net income loss adjusted for interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges 
we are also prohibited from paying any dividends without the bank s prior written consent 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial loan covenants 
we also receive funds from time to time from the exercise of options or similar rights to purchase shares of our common stock 
we have no other material external sources of liquidity 
we have generated positive cash flows from operations for thirteen consecutive quarters and we expect to 
table of contents continue to generate positive cash flows from operations in the near term 
while we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations in the near term  such cash flows may be less than the amounts recorded in prior quarters 
looking ahead  we do not anticipate any debt service payments in as a result of the early retirement of our outstanding debt obligations  unless we decide to incur new debt or borrow on our line of credit 
we expect capital expenditures in to be comparable with we also expect proceeds from the exercise of common stock options  however  it is not possible to estimate the impact those proceeds will have on our cash flow in we obtain a significant portion of our liquidity from operating cash flows 
our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across several industries 
no single customer accounted for greater than of our total revenue in any one quarter of or for the year 
at december   the company had a receivable  all of which was current  due from qwest communications international  inc of million or of the company s total accounts receivable balance at such date 
our five largest customers represented million or of our total revenue and also represented million or of our total accounts receivable balance at december  the sixth through twenty fifth largest customers represented million or of our total revenue 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of our larger customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows 
in addition  a decrease in their use of our services may adversely impact our future operating results 
for example  oracle corporation  whose purchases accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in the first and second quarters of  significantly reduced its use of our conferencing services as it completed the transition of substantially all of its conferencing to an internal conferencing system in the third quarter of as of december   our purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and telephony services and equipment were approximately million and will be expended over the next two years 
some of these agreements may be amended to either increase or decrease the minimum commitments during the lives of the respective contracts 
in september we entered into an agreement with our primary conferencing bridge provider pursuant to which we made a commitment to purchase a certain amount of equipment through december this commitment was contingent on certain functionality being available in the equipment by may   which did not occur 
as a result  we notified the conferencing bridge provider that we terminated our remaining commitment  as well as the agreement for material breach 
the total remaining commitment that we terminated as of december  was approximately million 
our vendor disputes this position  has threatened litigation and may seek to recover the alleged million remaining contractual commitment 
we lease office facilities under various operating leases that expire through total future minimum lease payments  under all operating leases  as of december   are approximately million 
we have subleased six of these facilities and future minimum sublease receivables for all subleased facilities  as of december   approximate million that we expect to receive through september our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years over years debt operating leases  exclusive of sublease receivables purchase obligations total contractual obligations and commitments not included in the contractual commitments schedule above are employment commitments we have made to certain current and former officers of the company 
see note c and d to the financial statements 
typically  the amount that may be paid and the timing of such a payment are not known with certainty 
at december  our total employment related commitments were approximately million 
not included in the contractual commitments schedule above is the equipment purchase commitment we terminated in the second quarter of see note b to the financial statements 
our vendor has disputed our position with respect to the termination 
the total remaining commitment that we terminated as of december  was approximately million  which would have been required to be expended in 
table of contents we currently anticipate that existing cash resources and our new revolving line of credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs into the foreseeable future 
we base our expenses and expenditures in part on our expectations of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than expected  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities  borrow on our revolving line of credit or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or  if available  may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria  the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our critical accounting estimates include the accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives of depreciable and intangible assets and their recoverability  the assessment of goodwill and its recoverability and the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following accounts receivable we perform periodic credit evaluations and continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our doubtful accounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience doubtful accounts at the same rate as we have in the past 
our accounts receivable is currently diverse and is comprised of numerous geographically dispersed customers who are dispersed across many different industries 
however  our five largest customers representing million or of total revenue also represented million or of our total december  accounts receivable balance 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of our larger customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivables  the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our future operating results 
we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers and as such actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate  we will record a credit or charge to sales and marketing expense in the period in which such determination is made 
long lived assets and their recoverability effective january   we adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas  long lived assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we recognize an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted estimated cash flows and we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or 
table of contents fair value less costs to sell 
in  we identified and removed from service equipment that was no longer required or had become obsolete 
the asset write offs were determined under the long lived assets to be disposed of by sale model described above 
we completed the sale and disposal of the assets in in connection with the plan of disposal  the carrying amount of the assets exceeded the fair value of the assets less costs to sell  and as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of we did not record any asset impairment losses in or goodwill effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas which requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas requires a two phase approach for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase if necessary measures the impairment 
in  and  we completed our first phase impairment analysis and did not find indication of impairment of our recorded goodwill  accordingly  the second testing phase was not necessary in each year 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and profitability to determine fair value 
the valuation techniques that we consider include a weighted average multiple of revenue  a weighted average multiple of cash flow  our stock market capitalization and the book value of our assets 
our stock has been and continues to be volatile 
we do not believe stock market capitalization alone  particularly given the volatility in our stock price  is a good indicator of impairment 
as such  we will continue to monitor the volatility in our stock price and the resulting market capitalization  as well as all of our other impairment indicators  and will continue to assess their collective impact on our recorded goodwill 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record charges for impairment of goodwill in the future and there can be no assurances that our goodwill will not be impaired in the future 
at december   we had approximately million in goodwill subject to the impairment testing provisions of sfas income tax valuation allowances currently  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax asset 
we review our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis for realizability 
while we generated net income for five consecutive quarters ended december  we incurred net losses in each quarter of and believe there currently is not enough positive evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets 
when we determine there is enough positive evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will realize some or all of our deferred tax assets  we will reduce the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  which will increase net income in the period in which such determination is made 
positive evidence to support a conclusion that our deferred tax assets are realizable includes  but is not limited to  generating net income in consecutive quarters and projections for taxable income sufficient to utilize our deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation our stock compensation expense is comprised of the following a the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the grant of stock options or shares of restricted stock to employees and board members at exercise or sale prices deemed to be less than fair value of the common stock at grant date  net of forfeitures related to such employees who terminated service while possessing unvested stock options  as these terminated employees have no further service obligations  b the intrinsic value of modified stock options or restricted stock awards  measured at the modification date  for the number of awards that  absent the modification  would have expired unexercisable  c the intrinsic value of restricted stock awards to employees and directors  d deferred stock based compensation associated with the acquisition of interact conferencing  llc and e compensation related to options granted to non employees 
we currently account for our stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price  the intrinsic value method 
under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  entities are permitted to recognize as expense  over the vesting period  the fair value of all stock based awards on the date of grant 
alternatively  sfas also allows entities to continue to apply the provisions 
table of contents of apb opinion and provide pro forma net income loss disclosures for employee stock option grants as if the fair value based method defined in sfas had been applied 
we have elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion and provide the pro forma disclosures required by sfas all stock based awards to non employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with sfas and related interpretations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the provisions of this statement will become effective in our third quarter commencing on july  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we have not determined the method we will use when we adopt sfas r 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position or cash flows 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted with certainty at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption and we have not assessed the impact of this provision in the context of our net operating loss carryforwards 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
eliminates the fair value exception in apb for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have a commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange is deemed to have commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of this statement will become effective in our third quarter commencing on july  management does not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows

the risk factors listed below  as well as any cautionary language in this document  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this document could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and stock price 
we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
our operating costs have exceeded our revenue in each year since our inception in april  except for the fiscal year we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million from our inception through december  although we have projected to report net income in the first quarter of  there can be no assurance that we will achieve or maintain profitability in the future  particularly if existing or future competitors decrease our market share  if price pressure increases  if our next generation services do not achieve widespread market acceptance  if such services reduce our revenue from our existing services  if our revenue from web related services does not substantially increase  or if we are unable to increase our market share as the web conferencing market grows 
if we are not able to significantly increase revenue  we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales and marketing  research and development  or other operating expenses  and as a result  we may be unable to continue our operations as currently planned 
increasing our revenue may be difficult for us to do as a result of increased competition  price pressure and other risk factors described in this section 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
we have a limited operating history and you should not rely on our recent results as an indication of our future performance 
we were incorporated in april and first recorded revenue in january we began commercially offering our reservationless conferencing service in april  our web conferencing pro service in june  our operator assisted conferencing service in the first quarter of and raindance meeting edition in march in january  we restructured our company to focus solely on our conferencing services 
in connection with this restructuring  we made significant changes to our services and growth strategies  our sales and marketing plans  and other operational matters  including a significant reduction in our employee base 
as a result  we have a limited relevant operating history and it may be difficult to evaluate an investment in our company  and we cannot be certain that our business model and future operating performance will yield the results that we intend 
as such  we may be required to restructure our company and operations in the future 
in addition  the rapidly changing nature of the web conferencing market makes it difficult or impossible for us to predict future results  and you should not expect our future revenue growth to equal or exceed historical growth rates 
there are a number of factors described in this section that could cause fluctuations in our operating results in any particular period 
if any of these risks are not within our control or we are otherwise unable to address these risks in a cost effective manner or at all  our operating results will be harmed 

table of contents we may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations or lack of growth in our quarterly operating results  which would cause our stock price to decline 
as a result of our limited operating history  increased competition  the rapidly changing market for our services  price pressure and the other risks described in this section  our quarterly operating results have varied significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly in future periods 
more recently  our quarterly operating results have declined 
for example  our quarterly net loss ranged between million and million in the four quarters ended december  and our quarterly revenue ranged between million in the first quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
many of the factors that affect our quarterly operating results are beyond our control  such as increased competition  pricing pressure and market demand for our services 
our ability to license software may also contribute to such fluctuations 
for example  in the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized a significant portion of our revenue from a non recurring software license 
licensing opportunities have traditionally arisen infrequently  are difficult to predict  and currently  we do not have any software licensing revenue projected 
additionally  we expect our results will fluctuate based on seasonal sales patterns 
our operating results have shown decreases in our usage based services around certain times  such as spring  summer  thanksgiving  december and new year holidays 
we expect that our revenue during these seasons will not grow at the same rates as compared to other periods of the year because of decreased use of our services by business customers 
as a result of these factors and other risks described in this section  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would decline 
a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to repeat customers  none of whom are obligated to continue to use our services 
the failure of continued use of our services by existing customers could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 
a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to repeat customer usage of our services 
our customers are not obligated to continue to use our services as we provide our services largely on a usage based pricing model 
in the year ended december   of our revenue was usage based 
in addition  customers have no obligation to renew subscription contracts with us 
as a result  our inability to retain existing customers and sustain or increase their usage of our services could result in lower than expected revenue  and therefore  impact our ability to achieve or maintain profitability  and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  because many of our customers have no continuing obligations with us  we may face increased downward pricing pressure that has caused  and will continue to cause  a decrease in our gross margins 
the reasons we have lost customers have included the failure of our software or systems to meet customers performance expectations or requirements  customers decision to purchase competitive products or services for reasons such as lower price  greater brand recognition and broader features and functionality  or the lack of significant efforts required to educate our customers about the benefits of our services 
a significant portion of our revenue is attributable to large customers that have no obligation to continue to use our services 
we target our services to large companies and as a result  we may experience an increase in customer concentration 
for example  our top five customers accounted for and of our revenue in the quarter and year ended december   respectively 
the sixth through twenty fifth largest customers represented of our revenue in both the quarter and year ended december   respectively 
these large customers have no obligation to continue to use our services 
for example  oracle corporation was a large customer of ours  representing of our revenue in the second quarter of  and then significantly reduced the use of our services as it completed its transition of substantially all of its conferencing to an internal conferencing system in the third quarter of if any of our large customers stop using our services or are unable to pay their debts as they become due  our operating results will be harmed  our revenue will be negatively impacted  and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability would be negatively impacted 
for example  we have a significant receivable due from qwest communications international  inc at december   which was approximately million or of the company s total accounts receivable balance 
our operating expenses may increase  and if our revenue does not increase  our operating results will be negatively impacted 
we may increase sales and marketing  research and development and other operating expenses  particularly as we continue developing our next generation services and architecture 
we project expenses in part on our

if our revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect  we may be unable to reduce our operating expenses for that period or at all  in which case our operating results and ability to achieve or maintain profitability would be negatively impacted 
we have experienced significant pricing pressure  which is expected to continue and has negatively impacted our financial results 
the prices for our services are subject to rapid and frequent changes  particularly our reservationless conferencing service 
for example  our average price per usage based minute for this service declined by in the year ended december  in many cases  competitors provide their services at significantly reduced rates  for free or on a trial basis in order to win customers 
in addition  telecommunications providers enjoy lower telephony costs as a result of their ownership of the underlying telecommunications network 
as a result  these carriers can offer services similar to ours at substantially reduced prices 
due to competitive factors and the rapidly changing marketplace  we have reduced our pricing in many circumstances and expect we will be required to further reduce our pricing structure in the future 
audio conferencing only revenue constituted of our revenue in the fourth quarter of and we expect that audio conferencing only revenue will continue to constitute the vast majority of our revenue in the near term 
as such  significant pricing pressure has negatively impacted  and will continue to negatively impact  our financial results 
the growth of our business substantially depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new services and features in a timely manner 
our growth depends on our ability to develop leading edge web conferencing services and features 
for example  we recently released our raindance meeting edition service and our switchtower technology in march  however  we will need to release additional features  functionalities and services to remain competitive in the market 
many companies  including some of our competitors  are utilizing less costly resources in china and india to develop and enhance their products and services 
as a result  our competitors are able to develop and introduce additional products  services and features more quickly and more cost effectively than we can 
if the services and features we develop fail to achieve widespread market acceptance or fail to generate significant revenue to offset operational costs  our financial results may be harmed and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
in addition  we have experienced development delays and cost overruns in our development efforts in the past and we may encounter these problems in the future 
delays and cost overruns could affect our ability to respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards  competitive developments or customer requirements 
in addition  our ability to introduce new services and features may depend on our ability to license or otherwise acquire technologies from third parties 
in such cases  we may be unable to identify suitable candidates or come to terms acceptable to us  particularly if such need arises from an intellectual property dispute 
we also may not be able to successfully alter the design of our systems to integrate new technologies 
our next generation services may impact the revenue we receive from existing services 
our raindance meeting edition and other next generation services may negatively impact the revenue we receive for our existing services  particularly our web conferencing pro services 
while we intend to continue to sell our web conferencing pro services  this service may lose market share due to the vast majority of our resources being expended on our next generation services and this product becoming obsolete 
in the event that we are unable to develop our next generation services in a timely manner  and if such next generation services do not generate significant revenue to offset any declining revenue from web conferencing pro services  our financial performance could be negatively affected  particularly revenue  gross margins and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 
competition in the web conferencing services and software market is intense and we may be unable to compete successfully  particularly as a result of recent announcements from large software companies 
the market for web conferencing services and software is relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
competition in our market will continue to intensify and competitors are investing significant resources to develop  market and sell competitive services 
as a result  we have experienced in the past and may continue to experience further price reductions  reduced sales  revenue and margins  and reduced acceptance of our services 
as an integrated provider of web and audio conferencing services  we compete with stand alone providers of web conferencing and traditional teleconferencing services 
in the web conferencing services market our principle 
table of contents competitors include centra software  cisco systems  genesys  ibm  macromedia  microsoft and webex 
our principle competitors in the teleconferencing market include at t  global crossing  mci  premiere global services formerly ptek  sprint and west corporation 
some of our competitors have entered or expanded their positions in the conferencing market by acquiring competitors of ours 
for example  microsoft acquired placeware  cisco systems acquired latitude communications  and west corporation acquired intercall 
in addition  some large software companies  such as oracle  ibm  citrix and macromedia  are also providing web conferencing products in addition to their software offerings 
these large companies have expended significantly greater resources developing  enhancing  marketing and selling conferencing services and or software that directly compete with our offerings  and because these companies can leverage widespread use of their products and services by existing customers to capture market share in the conferencing market  our market share as well as our revenue may significantly decline 
in addition  oracle  which was a large customer of ours  significantly reduced its use of our services as it completed the transition to an internal conferencing system in the third quarter of other competitors or potential competitors may enter or expand their positions in the conferencing market by acquiring one of our competitors  by forming strategic alliances with these competitors or by developing an integrated offering of services 
we also compete with resellers of web and audio conferencing services 
there are also a number of private companies that have entered or may enter the web conferencing market 
many of our current and potential competitors have larger and more established customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  broader service offerings  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations and distribution resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to spread costs across diversified lines of business  and therefore  adopt aggressive strategies  such as reduced pricing structures and large scale marketing campaigns  that reduce our ability to compete effectively 
telecommunication providers  for example  enjoy lower telephony costs as a result of their ownership of the underlying telecommunication network 
many more companies have entered and will continue to enter this market and invest significant resources to develop conferencing services that compete with ours 
these current and future competitors may also offer or develop products or services that perform better than ours and as a result capture market share that may reduce our share as well as our revenue 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic partnerships involving our current and potential competitors could harm us in a number of ways 
for example competitors could acquire or partner with companies with which we have distribution relationships and discontinue our partnership  resulting in the loss of distribution opportunities for our services  competitors could be acquired by or enter into strategic relationships with third parties that have greater resources and experience than we do  such as the cisco latitude  microsoft placeware  and west intercall acquisitions  thereby reducing our ability to compete with such competitors  or competitors could acquire or partner with our key suppliers  such as the acquisition of voyant technologies  our primary conferencing bridge supplier  by polycom  inc our sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our quarterly operating results 
our sales cycle varies from several weeks to several months depending on the type and size of customer approached 
oftentimes  potential customers require approvals from multiple decision makers within their organizations 
in addition  since most of our services are provided on a usage based pricing model  it generally takes several weeks or months before our services are ramped for use within an organization 
we also have experienced long sales cycles because we need to educate customers on the benefits of our web conferencing services  particularly raindance meeting edition 
these variables make it difficult for us to predict if and when our services will be adopted and used by our customers 
as a result  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict 
we have limited marketing  branding and lead generation efforts  which may not be successful 
we believe that significant marketing efforts are required to achieve brand recognition  to educate customers and potential customers on the benefits of our services  and to increase adoption of our services 
we have limited resources  however  to support marketing  branding and lead generation efforts 
as such  our current and planned marketing efforts may not be sufficient or successful to achieve the results we intend 
as a result  our business may be impacted  which may require us to further reduce investments in marketing 

table of contents in the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized a significant portion of our revenue from a non recurring software license 
we recognized million and million in revenue in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  associated with the sale of a web conferencing pro license to voyant technologies  which was subsequently acquired by polycom 
the software license fees associated with this license will not recur 
licensing opportunities have traditionally arisen infrequently  are difficult to predict and currently we do not have any software licensing revenue projected in the near term 
in addition  by licensing software we may have created an opportunity for voyant polycom to compete against us  which may reduce our market share  harm our competitive position  and create further price pressure 
as a result  our operating and financial performance may be harmed 
our business and operating results may suffer if we fail to establish distribution relationships or if our distribution partners do not successfully market and sell our services 
for the quarter ended december   of our revenue was attributable to our indirect service customers 
these customers may not be obligated to distribute our services through their sales channels 
in addition  these customers may not be obligated to continue to use our services or renew any subscription agreements with us 
as a result  we cannot anticipate the amount of revenue we will derive from these relationships in the future 
our inability to retain these customers and sustain or increase their distribution of our services could result in significant reductions in our revenue or we may be required to reduce the price they pay for our services  and therefore  reduce our margins and negatively affect our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 
if we fail to establish new distribution relationships in a timely manner or if our distribution partners do not successfully distribute our services  our ability to achieve widespread adoption for our services will suffer and our business and operating results will be harmed 
establishing these distribution relationships can take several months or more 
in some cases  our service limitations  such as our inability to offer branding capabilities to our resellers  has prevented us and will continue to prevent us from establishing distribution relationships 
additionally  since the vast majority our contracts with our distribution partners are usage based  it typically takes several months or longer before our distribution arrangements generate revenue 
our distribution partners are not prohibited from offering and reselling the products and services of our competitors and may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products and services of our competitors 
our largest conferencing bridge supplier has threatened litigation against us regarding a significant contract dispute 
in september  we entered into an agreement with voyant technologies  subsequently acquired by polycom  our largest conferencing bridge supplier  pursuant to which we made a significant commitment to purchase conferencing bridges through december this commitment was contingent on certain voip technology functionality being made available in the equipment by may   which did not occur 
as a result  we notified voyant technologies that we have terminated our remaining purchase commitment 
additionally  we terminated the agreement for material breach 
voyant technologies disputes our position  has threatened litigation and may seek to recover the alleged million remaining contractual commitment plus damages 
litigation could require us to spend significant amounts of time and money to defend ourselves regardless of merit 
if any of these claims were to prevail  we could be forced to pay damages  comply with injunctions and divert management attention and resources 
furthermore  this dispute may harm our relationship with this vendor and require that we seek alternative sources for conferencing bridges  which may be difficult and expensive to integrate into our infrastructure 
we have been sued for breach of contract and unjust enrichment and may be subject to additional litigation 
on may   a complaint was filed against us by italk  llc in the district court of boulder county  colorado alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment  seeking damages and injunctive relief regarding an expired covenant not to compete in a license agreement entered into in march raindance disputes plaintiff s claims and intends to defend against them vigorously 
in addition  we may be subject to other litigation  including from employees or former employees 
in addition  if we hire employees from our competitors  these competitors may claim that we have violated agreements with their former employees or otherwise violated the law 
litigation could require us to spend significant amounts of time and money to defend ourselves regardless of merit 
if any of these claims were to prevail  we could be forced to pay damages  comply with injunctions and divert management attention and resources 

table of contents we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and may be subject to additional claims alleging patent and intellectual property infringement in the future 
we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and may be subject to additional claims alleging patent and intellectual property infringement in the future 
as the number of competitors in our market grows  there is an increased risk that the proprietary systems and software upon which our services rely may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims 
our services may infringe issued third party patents or other intellectual property rights 
there may also be pending patent applications related to our services that we are unaware of since these applications are not made public until issued 
from time to time  we have received notices alleging that we infringe issued third party patents or other intellectual property rights 
for example  in february  we received a letter on behalf of webex alleging that our raindance meeting edition service infringes one or more claims of certain webex patents 
when this happens  we evaluate the allegations based on an investigation of the intellectual property asserted against our services 
in addition  we evaluate our ability to allege counterclaims 
we may also evaluate settlement opportunities  including licensing or cross licensing arrangements that may include royalty provisions or distribution restrictions  neither of which may be advantageous for our business 
in some cases  these matters result in litigation  which is expensive  time consuming and could divert management s attention and resources 
claims of this nature could require us to spend significant amounts of time and money to defend ourselves  regardless of their merit 
if any of these claims were to prevail  we could be forced to pay damages  comply with injunctions  or halt or delay distribution of our services while we reengineer them or seek licenses to necessary intellectual property  which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our competitors may be able to create systems with similar functionality to ours and third parties may obtain unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
the success of our business is substantially dependent on the proprietary systems that we have developed 
we own five patents issued in the united states relating to features of our web conferencing pro service 
other than these issued patents  our proprietary systems are not currently protected by any patents and we may not be successful in our efforts to secure additional patents for our proprietary systems 
our current patent claims may not be sufficient enough to protect our technology 
we also have thirteen pending patent applications in the united states covering aspects of our existing and next generation services and infrastructure 
we may file more patent applications in the future 
there is no assurance that our current and future patent applications will result in any patents being issued 
if they are issued  any patent claims allowed may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
in addition  any current or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented and any right granted thereunder may not provide meaningful protection to us 
the failure of any patent to provide protection for our technology would make it easier for other companies or individuals to develop and market similar systems and services without infringing upon any of our intellectual property rights 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we also rely on a combination of trademarks  service marks  trade secrets  copyrights  and confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties  and protective contractual provisions 
these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our web conferencing services and other intellectual property 
unauthorized third parties may copy or infringe upon aspects of our technology  services or other intellectual property 
regardless of our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors and others may be able to develop similar systems and services without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our proprietary systems and services may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property and we may not have any adequate remedies 
furthermore  the validity  enforceability and scope of protection for intellectual property such as ours in internet related industries are uncertain and still evolving 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain countries 
in addition  our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive  and as a result  negatively affect our financial results 
additionally  in any litigation the outcome is uncertain 

table of contents we substantially depend on a single supplier for conferencing bridges and a limited number of sources for telephony services  the loss of which could cause significant delays and increased costs in providing services to our existing and prospective customers 
we purchase substantially all of our conferencing bridges from a single supplier  voyant technologies  which was acquired by polycom 
any extended reduction  interruption or discontinuation in the supply of these bridges would cause significant delays and increased costs in providing services to our existing and prospective customers 
these bridges form the basis of our audio conferencing infrastructure  upon which the majority of our services rely 
in order to continue to expand our infrastructure capacity  we must purchase additional components from this supplier 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached of our capacity during peak usage  whereas  we typically operate at to of capacity 
in september  we entered into an agreement with voyant technologies pursuant to which we made a significant commitment to purchase a certain amount of conferencing bridges through december this commitment was contingent on certain voip technology functionality being made available in the equipment by may   which did not occur 
as a result  we notified voyant technologies that we have terminated our remaining purchase commitment 
additionally  we terminated the agreement for material breach 
if we are required to find alternative sources for conferencing bridges  we may experience difficulty in integrating them into our infrastructure and we could be required to expend significant money and resources  which may harm our operating results 
we also have a limited number of sources for our telephony services  particularly due to the current routed architecture of our audio conferencing network upon which the majority of our services rely 
if these suppliers were to terminate or interrupt their services  we may experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources on commercially reasonable terms or in integrating alternative sources into our technology platform 
in addition  if we were required to obtain these services from alternative sources  our cost of sales may substantially increase due to the limited amount of suppliers 
due to increased price compression in the conferencing industry  we may be required to alter the architecture of our audio conferencing network 
we have architected our audio conferencing network with conferencing bridges and telephony services to automatically route calls into conferences 
while more reliable  the cost of this routed architectural approach is more expensive than a non routed architecture 
for example  the cost of purchasing routed telephony services is more expensive than it would be to purchase non routed telephony services 
in addition  our costs of purchasing routed telephony services have not decreased at the same rate as our prices have for reservationless conferencing 
as a result of this trend  our margins have declined and our net losses have increased  which could continue 
in order to reduce costs  we may be required to alter the architecture of our audio conferencing network to a non routed network in order to take advantage of lower priced telephony services 
this would be expensive  as well as time consuming  as we would be required to purchase non routed conferencing bridges and we could experience technical difficulties and delays in doing so 
our transition to voip technology is subject to significant risks  delays and costs 
we recently announced that we intend to transition some of our long distance telephony traffic onto a voip platform 
as a result of this change  we become subject to significant risks  delays and costs 
the costs associated with a transition to a new service provider are substantial 
for example  we have reengineered our systems and infrastructure to accommodate our new service provider  and expect to continue to do so  which is both expensive and time consuming 
in addition  we have experienced disruptions and delays in this transition 
for example  our primary bridge conferencing vendor did not have certain functionality available in conferencing bridges required for this transition in the time periods we initially anticipated 
as such  we expect our transition to a widespread voip platform to be delayed 
there also may be unforeseen circumstances as a result of this transition that may cause delays in transitioning our long distance telephony traffic 
as a result of these delays  our ability to achieve or maintain profitability may be negatively impacted 
any interruption in the delivery of our services may cause a loss of revenue and a loss of customers 

table of contents if any of the third party services that we use become unavailable to us  our services would be subject to significant delays and increased costs 
we rely on third party services  such as internet access  transport and long distance providers 
these companies may not continue to provide services to us without disruptions  at the current cost  or at all 
the costs associated with a transition to a new service provider would be substantial 
we may be required to reengineer our systems and infrastructure to accommodate a new service provider  which would be both expensive and time consuming 
in addition  we have experienced disruptions and delays in our services in the past due to service disruptions from these providers 
any interruption in the delivery of our services would likely cause a loss of revenue and a loss of customers 
our business will suffer if our systems or services fail or become unavailable 
a reduction in the performance  reliability or availability of our systems or services will harm our ability to provide our services to our users  as well as harm our reputation 
some of our customers have experienced interruptions in our services in the past due to service or network outages  periodic system upgrades and internal system failures 
similar interruptions may occur from time to time in the future 
because our revenue depends largely on the number of users and the amount of minutes consumed by users  our business will suffer if we experience frequent or extended system interruptions or if our systems or services become unavailable 
our customers depend on the reliability of our services and we may lose customers if we fail to provide reliable services for even a single communication event 
we maintain our primary data facility and hosting servers at our headquarters in louisville  colorado  and two secondary data facilities in the denver  colorado metropolitan area 
our operations depend on our ability to protect these facilities and our systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  water  telecommunications failure  vandalism  sabotage and similar unexpected events 
in addition  a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our systems or infrastructure could strain the capacity of the software  hardware and systems that we use 
this could lead to slower response times or system failures 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could cause service interruptions and  as a result  materially harm our reputation and negatively affect our revenue and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 
our services are often used to share confidential and sensitive information and  as a result  if our security system is breached  our business and reputation could suffer 
we must securely receive and transmit confidential information for our customers over public networks and maintain that information on internal systems 
our failure to prevent security breaches could damage our reputation  and expose us to risk of loss or liability 
if we fail to provide adequate security measures to protect the confidential information of our customers  our customers may refrain from using our services or potential customers may not choose to use our services  and as a result  our operating results would be harmed 
our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
in addition  our internal systems are accessible to a number of our employees 
although each of these employees is subject to a confidentiality agreement  we may be unable to prevent the misappropriation of this information 
our business may be harmed if our services do not work with the various hardware and software systems  including corporate security measures  used by our customers 
we currently provide services to customers with various hardware and software systems  ranging from legacy to next generation applications and networking equipment 
if our services are unable to support these diverse platforms  and if we fail to modify our services to support new versions of these applications and equipment  our services may fail to gain broad market acceptance  which would cause our operating results to suffer 
for example  usage of our web conferencing pro services depends on computers being enabled with certain java technology 
there are new computers being shipped without microsoft s operating systems incorporating this java technology 
as such  our web conferencing pro services will not work on these computers unless the user downloads the java technology separately  which may be impracticable and expensive 
furthermore  because of bandwidth constraints on corporate intranets and concerns about security  our customers and potential customers may block reception of web services like ours within their corporate environments 
in order for customers to use our services  customers and users may 
table of contents need to reconfigure their corporate intranets  security measures and firewalls 
widespread adoption of our technology and services depends on overcoming these obstacles 
if we do not increase the capacity of our infrastructure in excess of customer demand  customers may experience service problems and choose not to use our services 
the amount of conferencing events we host has increased significantly 
we must continually increase our capacity consistent with our growth in usage 
we generally utilize between and of our capacity based on average usage 
in the fourth quarter  we reached of our capacity during peak usage 
to accommodate increased customer usage and rapidly expand our operations requires a significant increase in the capacity of our infrastructure 
to increase capacity  we may need to order equipment with substantial development and manufacturing lead times  which can sometimes be several months or longer 
if we fail to increase our capacity in a timely and efficient manner  customers may experience service problems  such as busy signals  improperly routed conferences  and interruptions in service 
service problems such as these would harm our reputation  cause us to lose customers and decrease our revenue  and therefore harm our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 
conversely  if we overestimate our capacity needs  we will pay for more capacity than we actually use  resulting in increased costs without a corresponding increase in revenue  which would harm our operating results 
we may pursue additional business relationships through acquisitions  joint ventures  or other investment prospects  which may not be successful  and we may not realize the benefits of any acquisition  joint venture  or other investment 
we have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions 
there may also be risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
further  these potential acquisitions  joint ventures and investments entail risks  uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business 
for example  we may not be able to successfully integrate a company s operations  technologies  products and services  information systems and personnel into our business 
an acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial controls  and divert management s attention away from our other business concerns 
there may also be unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition that may harm our operating results and key personnel may decide not to work for us 
these risks could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  if we were to make any acquisitions  we could  for example issue equity securities that would dilute our stockholders  expend cash  incur debt  assume unknown or contingent liabilities  and experience negative effects on our results of operations 
our failure to manage growth could cause increases in our operating costs  harm our ability to achieve or maintain profitability  and therefore  decrease the value of our stock 
despite our restructuring in january  which resulted in  among other things  a significant reduction in the size of our workforce  we have rapidly expanded since inception  and may continue to expand our operations and infrastructure organically or through acquisitions 
this expansion has placed in the past  and may place in the future  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and we may not effectively manage this growth 
rapidly expanding our business would require us to invest significant amounts of capital in our operations and resources  which would substantially increase our operating costs 
as a result  our failure to manage our growth effectively could cause substantial increases in our operating costs without corresponding increases in our revenue  thereby harming our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 
also  our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day to day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing growth 
in order to rapidly expand our business we may need to raise additional funds 
any future financing we require may not be available on a timely basis  in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain adequate funds  we may not be able to grow  which could impact our ability to compete effectively 

table of contents if we do not attract and retain qualified management and personnel  our business may be harmed 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified management and personnel 
recently  we hired a new chief executive officer  executive vice president of sales and chief marketing officer 
in addition  we have hired a number of personnel in sales and marketing in connection with the substantial reorganization of those groups in we may also continue to hire new personnel 
if we are not successful in attracting and retaining a substantial number of these individuals  our business may be disrupted  management time and resources may be expended and  as a result  our financial results may be harmed 
in addition  we rely on stock options to compensate existing employees and attract new employees 
we are currently not required to record stock based compensation charges if the employee s stock option exercise price equals or exceeds the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
however  the financial accounting standards board has issued its final standard relating to share based payments  including stock options and other equity incentives granted to employees 
this change in accounting policy will require us to record expense for the fair value of stock options granted  modified or settled in fiscal periods beginning after june  and recognize compensation cost with respect to any unvested stock options outstanding on july  because of this change in accounting policy  we expect to reduce our reliance on stock options as a compensation tool which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
if we do not expand further internationally  our ability to attract and retain multi national customers will be harmed and as a result our business and operating results may be harmed 
we have attempted to expand into international markets and spent significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
in particular  we formed a joint venture with viso limited  a european based venture capital firm  to expand our operations to continental europe and the united kingdom 
this joint venture failed and was recently liquidated and dissolved 
in the fourth quarter of  we expanded the capability of our reservationless conferencing service to offer multi national customers international access to our service through a partner in certain countries 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete effectively in international markets 
in addition  we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as difficulties in establishing and maintaining distribution channels and partners for our services  varying technology standards from country to country  uncertain protection of intellectual property rights  inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  linguistic and cultural differences  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  imposition of currency exchange controls  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  our expansion into international markets may require us to develop specific technology that will allow our current systems to work with international telephony systems 
we may not develop this technology in a timely manner  in a way to prevent service disruptions or at all 

table of contents our reservationless conferencing service may become subject to traditional telecommunications carrier regulation by federal and state authorities  which would increase the cost of providing our services and may subject us to penalties 
we believe our reservationless conferencing service is not subject to regulation by the federal communications commission fcc or any state public service commission because the services integrate traditional voice teleconferencing and added value internet services 
the fcc and state public service commissions  however  may require us to submit to traditional telecommunications carrier regulations for our reservationless conferencing service under the communications act of  as amended  and various state laws or regulations as a provider of telecommunications services 
for example  in march  we received a letter from the fcc investigations and hearing division of the enforcement bureau regarding filing requirements of telecommunications carriers 
if the fcc or any state public service commission seeks to enforce any of these laws or regulations against us  we could be prohibited from providing the voice aspect of our reservationless conferencing service  which constitutes the vast majority of our revenue  until we have obtained various federal and state licenses and filed tariffs 
we believe we would be able to obtain those licenses  although in some states  doing so could significantly delay our ability to provide services 
we also would be required to comply with other aspects of federal and state laws and regulations 
subjecting our reservationless conferencing service to these laws and regulations would increase our operating costs  could require restructuring of those services to charge separately for the voice and internet components  and would involve on going reporting and other compliance obligations 
we also might be subject to fines or forfeitures and civil or criminal penalties for non compliance 
we may be subject to assessment of state sales and other taxes for the sale of our services  license of technology or provision of services  for which we have not accounted 
we may have to pay past sales or other taxes that we have not collected from our customers 
for example  we recently were audited by the commonwealth of massachusetts  department of revenue who claims that our reservationless conferencing service is subject to sales tax in the commonwealth of massachusetts 
we have formally protested this assessment 
because we do not currently collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services  our total liability in the state of massachusetts could be as much as million based on the position taken by massachusetts 
additionally  more states may claim that we are subject to an assessment of sales or other taxes  in which case our total liability may increase 
our business would be harmed if one or more states were to require us to pay sales or other taxes on past sales of services  particularly because we may be unable to go back to customers to collect sales or other taxes for past sales and may have to pay such taxes out of our own funds 
our current stock compensation expense negatively impacts our earnings  and once we are required to report the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans as an expense in conjunction with financial accounting standards board r share based payment  our earnings will be adversely affected  which may cause our stock price to decline 
under our current accounting practice  stock compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price 
as of december  we had approximately million in deferred equity based compensation expense 
we expect this expense to be amortized over five years and to negatively impact our ability to achieve or maintain profitability during that time 
we recorded approximately million of this deferred stock based compensation in january associated with the issuance of  shares of restricted stock to our new president and chief executive officer 
in addition  we issued restricted stock grants for  shares of common stock on january  to certain executives and key employees 
the total amount of deferred stock based compensation recorded was million to be expensed ratably over years 
under current accounting practices and including the january restricted stock grants  million of this deferred equity based compensation will be recognized as an expense over the next year as certain restricted stock grants vest 
effective july   we will be required to record compensation expense in the financial statements for stock issued to employees based on the grant date fair value of the equity issued 
the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations and as such  our ability to achieve or maintain profitability will be negatively impacted  which may cause our stock price to decline 
we disclose non gaap financial information 
we prepare and release quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial 
table of contents information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
this non gaap financial information excludes certain non cash expenses  consisting primarily of depreciation  the amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we believe the disclosure of non gaap financial information helps investors meaningfully evaluate the results of our operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with the non gaap financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations 
as a publicly traded company we are subject to significant regulations  including the sarbanes oxley act of  some of which have either only recently been adopted or are currently proposals subject to change 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices and continue to update the program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements  we cannot assure that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations 
for example  we cannot assure that in the future our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we also cannot assure that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to attest that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our annual report on form k to be filed with the securities and exchange commission or attest that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions  fines  or other sanctions or litigation 
in addition  if we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  this may cause our stock price to decline 
we are subject to risks associated with governmental regulation and legal uncertainties 
it is likely that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted in the united states and other countries with respect to the internet that might affect us 
these laws may relate to areas such as changes in telecommunications regulations  copyright and other intellectual property rights  encryption  personal privacy concerns  including the use of cookies and individual user information  e commerce liability  and email  network and information security 
changes in telecommunications regulations could substantially increase the costs of communicating on the internet or over voip networks 
this  in turn  could slow the growth in internet use or voip networks and thereby decrease the demand for our services 
several telecommunications carriers are advocating that the federal communications commission regulate the internet and voip networks in the same manner as other telecommunications services by imposing access fees 
recent events suggest that the fcc may begin regulating the internet and voip networks in such a way 
in addition  we operate our services throughout the united states and state regulatory authorities may seek to regulate aspects of our services as telecommunication activities 
other countries and political organizations are likely to impose or favor more and different regulations than those that have been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the complexity of regulation 
the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties associated with their validity and enforcement  may affect the available distribution channels for and costs associated with our services  and may affect the growth of the internet or voip networks 
such laws or regulations may therefore harm our business 

table of contents our stock price is volatile and this volatility may depress our stock price  result in litigation or indicate that our goodwill is impaired  resulting in further declines to our stock price 
the stock market in general  and the stock price of our company in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
for example  between january  and december  our stock has traded as high as and as low as on the nasdaq national market 
the volatility of our stock price can be due to factors such as  fluctuating operating results  significant purchases and sales of our stock  announcements by us or our competitors  changes in security analysts estimates of our performance  or our failure to meet analysts expectations 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  broad market and industry factors may negatively impact our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
many companies that have experienced volatility in their stock prices have been targets for securities class action litigation 
if we were subject to any such litigation  we could be required to expend substantial costs and resources  which could harm our business 
additionally  one of the factors that we consider in determining a potential impairment of our goodwill is our stock market capitalization 
if our stock price declines and remains depressed for an extended period of time  our reported goodwill could be materially adversely impaired which would require us to write down our goodwill  and this charge may cause our stock price to decline further 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had no outstanding debt obligations 
future increases in interest rates could increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings  including any advances on our revolving line of credit 
in april we entered into a credit agreement with a bank for a million revolving line of credit that bears interest at below the bank s prime rate and matures in april  under which we would be exposed to the risk that a material increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense to the extent that we make any future draw downs on the revolving line of credit 
at december   we did not have an outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit  however million of the line of credit was securing letters of credit 
we are currently not exposed to foreign currency risks  however  we may decide to make future investments that will subject us to this risk  as well as additional market risk
