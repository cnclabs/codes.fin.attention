page item legal proceedings palatin technologies  inc on september   we filed a complaint alleging breach of contract against palatin technologies  inc palatin in the superior court  judicial district of fairfield at bridgeport  connecticut  seeking monetary damages  interest  attorneys fees  court costs  punitive damages  and other remuneration at the option of the court 
further action in this case is pending 
the breach of contract alleged relates to a mediated settlement agreement with palatin on june  pursuant to the settlement  palatin paid us  and further agreed to issue to us promptly  shares of its unrestricted common stock 
palatin tendered restricted shares to us that were not registered for resale and thus we would have been severely restricted from selling  transferring or otherwise disposing of the shares  which was not in accordance with the settlement 
as a result of palatin s failure to honor all the terms of the june  settlement  we filed the complaint to obtain unrestricted shares  damages  and to recover our enforcement costs 
the settlement was the result of a mediation of a prior dispute whereby on october   we had demanded arbitration  as provided for in a license between us and palatin  due to our belief that palatin was in material breach of their license agreement with us for their exclusive use of our technology in developing their experimental therapeutic treatment for male and female sexual dysfunction 
pursuant to the terms of our license  we are entitled to receive of any sublicense fee that palatin receives 
on august   palatin announced that they had granted a co exclusive license to king pharmaceuticals  inc king  included in a collaborative development and marketing agreement between palatin and king 
on august   palatin announced that they had received an initial million from king  but did not submit any funds to us  which caused us to notify palatin that they were in breach 
the mediation settlement entered into by ctt and palatin referred only to the disposition of this particular million sublicensing fee received by palatin from king  and did not pertain to any future milestone payments  or to any other future payments to be made by king to palatin that may be covered under palatin s license with us 
although palatin has made statements in their public filings that this agreement released them from any other obligations to us relating to future payments received from king  we disagree with their statements  and reserve our rights under the original license granted to palatin

employment matters on august   ctt received notice that john b 
nano  its former president and chief executive officer  had commenced suit in the superior court in the judicial district of stamford  connecticut seeking the pre judgment remedy of attachment 
mr 
nano s suit seeks to attach one of ctt s bank accounts in the amount of million to preserve his ability to collect should he succeed on his claims 
in his suit  mr 
nano alleges that ctt breached his employment contract because it denied him certain severance benefits when it terminated him on june  mr 
nano also claims  in the alternative  that ctt violated a proposed but unexecuted and undelivered separation agreement and general release which it sought to negotiate with him at the time of his departure 
according to his lawsuit  mr 
nano claims that ctt withdrew the agreement after he communicated his acceptance to the chairman of ctt s board of directors 
ctt denies the allegations of the suit and intends to vigorously defend it and oppose mr 
nano s application for a prejudgment remedy 
a hearing is tentatively scheduled on this motion for late fall 
page on september   we announced that we had received notice that mr 
nano also had filed a complaint with the occupational safety and health administration osha  alleging a violation of section of the corporate and criminal fraud accountability act of  usc a the sarbanes oxley act by the company in connection with the termination of his employment 
the company believes that the complaint is totally without merit  and is exploring several claims against mr 
nano 
ctt filed an answer to the osha inquiry on october  relating to a separate matter  on february   osha issued a finding that there was probable cause to believe that ctt had violated section of the sarbanes oxley act by terminating wil jacques and scott bechtel in june based on the finding  osha ordered that the complainants be reinstated and that ctt pay damages totaling approximately  jacques and bechtel contend that they were improperly terminated for raising concerns about financial reporting 
ctt contends that jacques and bechtel did not raise protected concerns and were terminated for lawful  non discriminatory reasons  that osha failed to fairly investigate and consider all relevant facts  and that the conclusions drawn by osha were legally erroneous 
ctt denies that it is liable to the complainants in any amount 
the osha finding did not constitute a final agency order 
in accordance with law and regulation  on february   we filed timely objections and requested a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge alj of the us department of labor dol 
the hearing was held on may may  on may   ctt and plaintiff jacques entered into a memorandum of understanding  which later was approved by the alj  whereby all claims against ctt by jacques were resolved 
pursuant to the settlement  ctt paid plaintiff jacques a lump sum payment and reimbursement for certain reasonable legal fees  and agreed to pay him certain minimum consulting fees over the next two years 
the lump sum payment and legal fee reimbursement were recorded in the quarter ending july  the consulting fees are not significant  and will be recorded as they are paid 
on october   the alj s findings were issued  in which all of the claims of mr 
bechtel were dismissed  and further  that the issue of damages was not relevant since the plaintiff failed to carry his burden of proof 
the plaintiff has ten business days in which to file an appeal 
we cannot predict whether or not an appeal will be filed  or the total amount of legal fees or other expenses that we will incur in relating to this matter 
legal fees incurred since the inception of this matter through july   were approximately  separate from the hearing before the alj  ctt appealed the reinstatement order before a judge in the united states district court  district of connecticut the district court 
the reinstatement order would have required reinstatement as of february  on may   the appeal was denied 
on may   ctt filed for a reconsideration and or modification of the may  order 
on may   the district court granted ctt s motion for reconsideration  but did not change the ruling requiring reinstatement 
ctt reinstated plaintiff bechtel effective february  the dol requested a show cause hearing before the district court as to why ctt should not be held in contempt of court for not complying immediately with the reinstatement order 
on july   a hearing was held on the motion but no resolution was reached 
further action on the motion is pending 
page axis shield on may   we filed a stipulation with the court to dismiss with prejudice all outstanding litigation with axis shield plc and axis shield  asa collectively  axis shield 
the dismissal was filed as a result of a settlement we reached with axis shield  pursuant to which axis shield was granted a license to sell tests used to measure homocysteine levels 
axis shield paid an upfront license fee  back royalties  and will pay royalties going forward from the date of the license 
the term of the license is through july  the expiration date of the patent 
in addition  axis shield withdrew their complaint against us 
on february   we had filed a complaint alleging infringement of our patent covering homocysteine assays against axis shield in the us district court for the district of colorado  seeking monetary damages  punitive damages  attorneys fees  court costs and other remuneration at the option of the court 
axis shield was served notice of our complaint on february  also on february   we were served notice that axis shield had filed a complaint against ctt on november   in the us district court for the district of connecticut seeking declaratory relief that our patent covering homocysteine assays was invalid and that axis shield had not infringed and was not infringing on our patent covering homocysteine assays 
in addition  axis shield alleged that ctt had engaged in unfair competition by threats of and actual litigation in the health industry  and had sought general  compensatory and exemplary damages  and attorneys fees  court costs and other remuneration at the option of the court 
bio rad laboratories  inc on may   we agreed to withdraw a complaint that we had filed against bio rad laboratories  inc bio rad on december   in the us district court for the district of colorado  in which we had alleged infringement of our patent covering homocysteine assays 
the complaint was withdrawn when axis shield signed a license with us  since bio rad purchases their homocysteine test kits from axis shield  and purchasers of kits from axis shield are covered under axis shield s license 
in the bio rad complaint  we had sought monetary damages  punitive damages  attorneys fees  court costs and other remuneration at the option of the court 
laboratory corporation of america holdings d b a labcorp on august   the us court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc denied the petition of laboratory corporation of america holdings d b a labcorp labcorp for a rehearing or a rehearing en banc rehearing by the full cafc of a june  decision affirming a november court decision in favor of metabolite laboratories  inc mli and us collectively  the plaintiffs 
as a result of this decision  on august   the plaintiffs received approximately million 
our share of the million payment was  and we recorded  in royalty legal awards and  in interest income during the quarter ended october  the payment did not include attorneys fees or court costs previously awarded to the plaintiffs that were under appeal with the court 
on january   the cafc issued a summary dismissal of labcorp s appeal of the court s award of attorneys fees and court costs from the original case  and  on april   we announced that we had received payment from labcorp for the attorneys fees and court costs 
our share of the payment was  and we recorded  in royalty legal awards and  in interest income during the quarter ended april  our claim for additional attorneys fees and court costs related to the appeals process is still pending 
as a result of the august  cafc decision  on november   labcorp filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the us supreme court the court relating to the november decision 
a writ of certiorari is a petition requesting the court to hear an appeal 
on february   we announced that the court had invited the solicitor general s office the sgo to file a brief in this case expressing its views on the question of the patentability of method patents of this type 
on august   the sgo issued its brief  recommending that the court deny labcorp s petition 
the court is not obligated to follow the sgo s views on the matter  though it usually does 
if the court denies labcorp s petition  then labcorp will have no further avenues of appeal 
if the court ignores the opinion of the sgo and agrees to hear labcorp s appeal  and then remands the case to the district court  and then if the original judgment is subsequently reversed  labcorp may attempt to recover amounts paid to the plaintiffs  including royalties paid to us as part of a january stipulated court order the stipulated order 
pursuant to the stipulated order  the court had stayed execution of a monetary judgment and a permanent injunction that prevented labcorp from performing homocysteine assays  and labcorp had agreed to pay us a percentage of their homocysteine assay sales during their appeals process 
labcorp s ability to recover any amounts paid to the plaintiffs would depend on the extent and reason for the reversal 
from january through april   labcorp paid us an aggregate of  under the stipulated order  including both our retained amounts and amounts paid or payable to our clients 
we believe that the probability that labcorp will recover any amounts paid is remote 
the appeals process was considered to have ended in april 
thus  since april   labcorp has not paid us any royalties  but they may be purchasing assays through one of our licensees 
the court has not yet ruled on labcorp s petition 
page the funds we received on august  were released from a bond previously posted by labcorp as part of the appeals process in this homocysteine assay patent infringement case originally filed by the plaintiffs against labcorp on may   in the united states district court for the district of colorado 
the plaintiffs alleged  in part  breach of contract  patent infringement and that labcorp owed the plaintiffs royalties for homocysteine assays performed beginning in the summer of using methods falling within the claims of a patent we own 
we licensed the patent on a non exclusive basis to mli and mli sublicensed it to labcorp 
plaintiffs sought unspecified monetary and exemplary damages  for labcorp to cure past breaches  to provide an accounting of wrongfully withheld royalties  and to refrain from infringing the patent 
plaintiffs also sought reimbursement of their attorneys fees 
labcorp filed an answer and counterclaims alleging non infringement  patent invalidity and patent misuse 
in november a jury confirmed the validity of our patent rights  found that labcorp willfully infringed our patent and breached their sublicense contract  and awarded damages to the plaintiffs 
in december  the court entered judgment affirming the jury s verdict 
in an amended judgment issued in november  the court awarded the plaintiffs approximately  in damages   in enhanced punitive damages   in attorneys fees  and  in prejudgment interest  and issued a permanent injunction barring labcorp from performing future homocysteine assays

overview we are a full service technology transfer and licensing provider 
we provide technology transfer  selling and licensing services focused on the technology needs of our customers  matching those requirements with commercially viable technology solutions  bridging the gap between market demand and raw innovation 
we develop relationships with universities  companies  inventors and patent or intellectual property holders to obtain the rights or a license to their intellectual property rights  principally patents and inventions collectively  the technology  and they become our clients  for whom we find markets to sell or further develop their technology 
we also develop relationships with those who have a need or use for technologies  and they become our customers  usually through a license or sublicense 
we identify and commercialize innovative technologies in life and physical sciences  electronics  and nanotechnologies developed by universities  companies and inventors 
our goal is to maximize the value of intellectual assets for the benefit of our clients  customers and shareholders 
we earn revenues primarily from licensing our clients and our own technologies to our customers licensees 
our customers pay us royalties based on their usage of the technology  and we share the fees with our clients 
in the normal course of our business  patents expire and revenues generated one year may not recur in the following year 
as explained below  in we had a concentration of revenues derived from four technologies 
because we have rounded all amounts in this item to the nearest thousand dollars  certain amounts may not total precisely 
in addition  all periods discussed in this item relate to our fiscal year ending july first  second  third and fourth quarters ending october  january  april and july  respectively

summary of results net income for was  or per diluted share  compared to net income for of  or per diluted share  an improvement of  or per diluted share

these revenues may not recur in subsequent years  or may recur in different magnitudes 
in the total of such upfront license fees and the royalty audit aggregated to  of this amount  approximately  was from homocysteine licenses 
in there were no significant upfront license fees and no royalty audit settlements 
thus without these special revenues our retained royalties for would have been  and would have increased  or over approximately of our retained royalties for were from four technologies from homocysteine assays  from ethyol  from gallium arsenide patents  and from sexual dysfunction 
we are seeking new technologies to mitigate this concentration of revenues  to replace revenues from expiring licenses and to provide future revenues 
the increase in revenues from the homocysteine assay life sciences was due principally to non refundable  non creditable  upfront license fees and recurring royalties earned on new licenses granted during the year  including licenses granted to abbott laboratories abbott  axis shield  bayer corporation bayer  beckman coulter  dade behring  inc  diagnostic products corporation  ortho clinical diagnostics a johnson johnson company  and the diagnostics division of f 
hoffman la roche ltd 
roche 
these licenses  and other new licenses granted in relating to homocysteine testing  generally provide for a non refundable  non creditable against future royalties upfront license fee and a royalty to be paid to us based on a fixed fee per test 
the amount of the fixed fee is determined based on estimated volume 
all of the upfront license fees received in were in cash  except for bayer  which was paid one half upon signing the license  with the other half due in october page pursuant to the license with abbott  abbott agreed to pay us a non refundable  non creditable upfront license fee  certain milestone fees as defined in the license  and per test royalties on homocysteine assay sales made in the us after january  in january  upon receipt  we recorded  in retained royalties  representing our share of the upfront license fee 
the milestone fees  our share of which aggregates to  will be paid to us in two equal installments of  on january  and  as long as our patent is valid and enforceable 
we are accruing the present value of the aggregate of the milestone fees in retained royalties in calendar year and  accordingly  we accrued  in retained royalties from inception of the license through july  no per test royalties are payable from abbott in calendar year in general  in those cases where the homocysteine licensee makes or distributes test kits  the license granted in relieved the licensee s customers from their obligation to pay us royalties on tests performed using the licensee s homocysteine assay 
the license also released the licensee s customers of any obligation to pay us royalties for homocysteine tests performed using the licensee s assays in the past  but did not entitle them to any refund of any royalties previously paid to us 
with certain limited exceptions  the term of all of the homocysteine licenses granted is through july  the expiration date of the patent 
the number of physicians prescribing and using the results of the homocysteine assay has increased dramatically  and it is becoming a frequently prescribed test 
our us patent that covers this homocysteine assay  the validity of which has been confirmed by a court decision  expires in july revenues  exclusive of upfront license fees  relating to the homocysteine assay continue to grow  and we believe that this trend will continue  but we cannot predict the magnitude of growth as we have no control over it  and we cannot predict if or when we will succeed in closing any additional license agreements and enforcing our patent rights 
we believe that we currently have licenses with the most significant distributors and laboratories in the united states that sell and or perform tests used to measure homocysteine levels 
however  since we also believe that there still are others using and or selling tests without a license  we continue to monitor the market to protect the patent rights of ourselves  our clients  and our current license holders  and will take action  including litigation  if necessary  to enforce and protect our patent rights 
we expect ethyol life sciences and the plasma display physical sciences retained royalties to continue at the current level for several years 
ethyol is an agent that reduces certain side effects of chemotherapy  and is licensed by southern research institute sri  exclusively to medimmune  inc formerly us bioscience  us pursuant to an agreement between ctt and sri  sri pays us up to a maximum of  per calendar year from ethyol license income it receives 
since calendar we have received the maximum revenue each year 
this patent expires in december inventions using gallium arsenide electronics to improve semiconductor operating characteristics were developed at the university of illinois 
us patents were issued from march to may patents expired starting in may and will continue to expire through september after september  we will not receive any future royalties for this technology 
we have licensed this technology to mitsubishi electric corporation  nec corporation  semiconductor company  matsushita electric industrial co  ltd  sdl  inc  hitachi ltd  tottori sanyo electric co  ltd  toshiba corporation  and one us licensee some licenses have since expired 
the increase in gallium arsenide revenues resulted from a one time settlement of back royalties from one customer as a result of a royalty audit and subsequent litigation relating to an expired license 
our share of the settlement was  net of fees paid to a royalty auditing firm 
without this settlement  royalties would have decreased due to licenses that expired in the prior year 
approximately   and  respectively  of retained royalties in fiscal  and  were from the us licensee s sales of licensed product  the remaining   and  respectively  were from several foreign licenses 
page the increase in revenues related to our sexual dysfunction technology was due to our settlement with palatin technologies  inc palatin on june   related to a subcontract fee received by palatin in august the settlement was the result of a mediation of a prior dispute whereby we had demanded arbitration  as provided for in the license between us and palatin  due to our belief that palatin was in material breach of the license 
pursuant to the settlement  palatin made a cash payment to us  our share of which was  and further agreed to issue to us promptly  shares of its unrestricted common stock 
though we have not received the unrestricted common stock from palatin  we accrued as income  representing our share of the estimated value of the stock  after considering the effect of the stock restriction  bringing the total recorded for the settlement to  palatin tendered restricted shares to us that were not registered for resale 
since palatin failed to issue us unrestricted shares  we filed a complaint against them as a result of their failure to honor all the terms of the june  settlement 
for further information  see item legal proceedings 
the palatin license is for palatin s exclusive use of our technology in developing their experimental therapeutic treatment for male and female sexual dysfunction

on august   palatin announced that they had received an initial million from king  but did not submit any funds to us  which caused us to notify palatin that they were in breach  and later demand arbitration 
the mediation settlement entered into by ctt and palatin referred only to the disposition of this particular million sublicensing fee received by palatin from king  and did not pertain to any future milestone payments  or to any other future payments to be made by king to palatin that may be covered under the palatin s license with us 
although palatin has made statements in their public filings that this agreement released them from any other obligations to us relating to future payments received from king  we disagree with their statements  and reserve our rights under the original license granted to palatin 
royalty legal awards were  for  and  for  and comprised approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for and in we received two awards related to litigation with laboratory corporation of america holdings d b a labcorp labcorp  including  released from the original november decision in this homocysteine patent infringement case that upheld the validity of our homocysteine patent  and that labcorp had appealed unsuccessfully  and  for attorneys fees and court costs also awarded in the original case 
for a further discussion of the original case and labcorp s appeals  see item legal proceedings 
in  royalty legal awards were entirely from the finalization and receipt of our portion of the materna litigation award that had been ongoing for many years 
dividends received of  for were from our receipt of three separate dividends from our investee  melanotan corporation melanotan  in which we own approximately of the common stock 
there was no dividend income in we previously had purchased the shares of melanotan for a nominal amount  and  in a separate transaction  we licensed to melanotan certain rights relating to a sunless tanning technology that we own 
the technology may lessen or prevent skin cancer caused by unprotected sun exposure 
melanotan sublicensed the rights to epitan limited australia epitan  and also had received shares of epitan 
melanotan has no operations of its own 
page epitan essentially is a research and development company that is in the process of conducting safety and efficacy trials  and evaluating the technology for future commercialization 
it currently is planning phase trials in australia generally the last stage of testing required prior to approval to market for the technology trials for use in the us will begin after that 
epitan common stock is traded on the australian stock exchange quoted in australian dollars under the symbol ept 
in october  melanotan paid its shareholders a dividend in the form of shares of epitan common stock 
as a result  we received  shares of epitan common stock 
as a condition to receiving the dividend  we agreed not to sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares before october  we estimated the fair value of the epitan common stock using the closing price of the shares per share  australian dollars and the exchange rate for converting australian dollars to us dollars australian dollars to us dollar on the date that melanotan s board of directors approved the dividend 
we then discounted the value of the shares using a discount factor to recognize the estimated impact of the sale restriction epitan has minimal revenues and has incurred substantial current and accumulated net losses 
we recorded the estimated value of the shares   as dividend income and included the asset in equity securities available for sale 
in may melanotan paid a special cash dividend 
our share of the dividend was  in addition  in june  melanotan paid another dividend in the form of epitan common stock 
as a result  we received an additional  shares of epitan common stock and recorded additional dividend income of  as a condition to receiving this dividend  we again agreed not to sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares before october  we valued the shares and dividend received in the same manner as the october dividend except with a price per share of australian dollars  and exchange rate of australian dollars to us dollar 
in total  we received and now directly own  shares of epitan common stock 
our ownership percentage of epitan s common stock is not significant 
as a result of the dividends  melanotan does not own any more stock of epitan 
its only asset is the license and sublicense to the technology  and cash 
unrealized market price and foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the epitan shares have been included in other comprehensive loss in shareholders interest 
other comprehensive loss for the year ended july   was  consisting of an unrealized loss on the market value of the shares of  partially offset by an unrealized foreign exchange gain on the value of the us dollar compared to the australian dollar of  comprehensive income for the year ended july   was settlement with unilens  net for was  compared to  in  and related to our settlement with unilens corp 
usa unilens in october this settlement is described in detail in results of operations vs 
as a result of the settlement  in we recorded only interest income related to the settlement during the first three quarters of the year 
in the fourth quarter  as a result of unilens accelerating their payments on the receivable and paying the balance in full faster than we estimated in when we recognized the receivable  we recorded an additional  of gain 
at july   the receivable was paid in full 
interest income  net for was  compared to  in included in was  of interest from the labcorp awards  and  of interest earned on the unilens receivable 
the balance   principally was interest earned from our invested cash and cash equivalents  which increased significantly over in   of the  of interest was interest from the materna award 
the balance of  was earned from our invested cash and cash equivalents 
page expenses increase decrease increase decrease personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues general and administrative expenses patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements impairment loss on investments total expenses personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues increased due to several factors 
personnel expenses for increased  from the prior year 
this was due principally to bonus and commission accruals that increased  compared to salaries  payroll taxes and employee benefits also increased approximately  due to an increase in the number of our employees  certain salary increases  and for a non cash charge of  incurred as a result of modifying the terms of certain stock options previously granted to a former employee to extend the exercise terms of the options there was no such expense in the prior year 
in addition  other direct expenses increased  principally due to legal fees incurred in connection with the gallium arsenide back royalty litigation and settlement  a one time charge for technical services to support licensing a technology which costs are partially recoverable from future licensing revenues  if any  legal and other costs related to litigating and licensing our homocysteine assay to others  and other costs to maintain certain technologies 
offsetting these increases  consultants fees and expenses decreased approximately  as some former consultants were hired as employees  severance costs decreased  as we paid severance to a former officer during  and recruiting and relocation costs decreased  there were no severance  recruiting or relocation costs incurred in general and administrative expenses increased due to several factors 
we incurred approximately  in legal costs related to our defense of a preliminary finding against us by the occupational safety and health administration  and related court issues  and  in estimated legal costs related to a complaint filed against us by our former president and chief executive officer 
both are described in more detail in item legal proceedings 
in we also incurred approximately  of costs that we did not incur in the prior year to comply with the internal control documentation and testing requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of this compliance cost will be ongoing 
other increases included  in expenses related to being a publicly traded company  including costs relating to our annual report  proxy  annual meeting  and costs relating to investor relations  and an increase of  in travel related both to investor relations and to review new business opportunities 
directors fees and expenses increased  principally due to a non cash charge of  incurred as a result of modifying the terms of certain stock options previously granted to a former director to extend the exercise term of the options there was no such expense in the prior year  and  in increased fees and expenses as a result of more board meetings being held in service fees and expenses increased  over due to new business initiatives being explored 
partially offsetting the increases described above was a credit of  recorded in for a reimbursement from our directors and officers liability insurance carrier  as settlement of litigation we had filed against the carrier seeking reimbursement under our policy of legal fees incurred since in connection with an investigation of ctt by the securities and exchange commission sec see item legal proceedings 
our insurance carrier also acknowledged that we had met our deductible under our policy relating to this matter  and confirmed that they will provide and have provided coverage  in accordance with the terms of the policy  for losses incurred in the sec civil suit filed in august accordingly  we have recorded a credit and not any significant costs in relating to the sec investigation and civil suit  compared to  of expense in page patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  reflect our level of activity and vary depending on the stage of the litigation 
our overall activity in was higher than in  principally due to litigation related to the labcorp and several other homocysteine cases  and the palatin arbitration 
however  due to the income generated from new homocysteine licenses  we were able to recover a significant amount of expense incurred in and prior years from the new revenues generated  which more than offset costs incurred in  resulting in an overall credit balance for the year in the expense 
provision for income taxes in prior years  we generated significant federal and state income and alternative minimum tax losses  and these net operating losses nols were carried forward for income tax purposes to be used against future taxable income 
this fiscal year  we will utilize a portion of our nols against our current year regular federal and state taxable income  effectively eliminating our regular income tax liabilities 
however  we expect to be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax amt  where we are limited to using our nols against only of our income  and our year to date provision is for our estimated amt liability 
the nols are an asset to us since we can use them to offset or reduce future taxable income and therefore reduce the amount of both federal and state income taxes to be paid in future years 
previously  since we were incurring losses and could not be sure that we would have future taxable income to be able to use the benefit of our nols  we recorded a valuation allowance against the asset  reducing its book value to zero 
as a result of the income we earned for the year  we reversed  of the valuation allowance  representing the amount of the nol we will utilize to offset any income tax liability excluding the amt liability  on income earned during the year  and recorded a provision for income taxes of the same amount 
the effective income tax rate of the provision for the year was 
the difference between the effective rate and our combined statutory federal and state rates of approximately for the year  was due principally to the impact of dividend income  which is included in book income at its full amount but due to favorable tax regulations  is virtually excluded from taxable income 
we used our nols to eliminate our regular income tax liability  and the provision recorded principally is for our estimated amt liability 
we continue to have substantial federal and state operating and capital loss carryforwards to use against future regular taxable income 
in addition  we can use our nols to reduce our future amt liability 
however  a significant portion of the nols remaining at july   approximately  were derived from income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
the tax effect of these deductions will be credited against capital in excess of par value at the time they are utilized for book purposes  and not credited to income 
thus we will not receive a benefit for these nols in our statement of operations 
we did not record an income tax provision in since we incurred a substantial net operating loss for income tax purposes 
this was due principally to the unilens receivable that had no basis for book purposes but was fully valued for income tax purposes 
as a result  the settlement with unilens in october generated a significant loss on an income tax basis  compared to income of  on a book basis 
page results of operations vs 
summary of results net income for was  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss for of  or per diluted share  an improvement of  or per diluted share 
the reasons for the increase in net income are explained below in the sections that follow 
revenues total revenues for were  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
retained royalties for were  which was  or lower than the  reported in the following table compares revenues from technologies with retained royalties greater than  in or increase decrease increase decrease homocysteine assay ethyol gallium arsenide plasma display electrochromic display vitamin b assay all other technologies total retained royalties the number of physicians prescribing and using the results of the homocysteine assay has increased dramatically  and it is becoming a more frequently prescribed test 
our us patent that covers this homocysteine assay  the validity of which has been confirmed by a court decision  expires in july we believe that revenues from this technology will continue to grow  possibly at a substantial rate  but we cannot predict if or when we will succeed in closing additional license agreements and enforcing our patent rights  or how the growth in volume will affect assay pricing 
we expect ethyol retained royalties to continue at their level for several years 
the decreases in retained royalties from gallium arsenide  electrochromic display and the vitamin b assay were the result of expired or terminated licenses 
approximately of our retained royalties for was from three technologies from homocysteine assays  from ethyol  and from gallium arsenide patents 
we are seeking new technologies to mitigate this concentration of revenues  to replace revenues from expiring licenses and to provide future revenues 
page royalty legal awards comprised approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for and  and were derived from the materna litigation 
we recorded these revenues in the following captions and periods materna litigation income summary period reported royalty settlements and awards interest income  net total revenues first quarter second quarter third quarter total fourth quarter total cumulative total to generate cash  in the first and second quarters of and the fourth quarter of  we sold   and  respectively  of our materna award without recourse for   and  in cash 
had we not done this  our portion of the final award would have been  including interest awarded 
settlement with unilens  net for was  relating to our settlement with unilens in october unilens agreed to pay us a gross amount of  in quarterly installments of at least  to settle an old receivable due us that we had written off in prior years 
through june  we recorded  of income  representing our portion of the cash collected from unilens under the settlement 
at july  we reviewed unilens financial condition and determined that the remaining balance of the receivable was collectible 
as a result  we recorded income of  which represented the net present value of our portion of the remaining receivable balance 
we accrued interest income on the receivable from unilens as we received installment payments from unilens 
in prior years we had received shares of unilens stock in partial payment against the old receivable 
we sold the remaining shares in the fourth quarter  generating net proceeds of  which we also recorded as income since the shares had no book value 
interest income  net for was  compared to  in in addition to the interest income related to the materna award discussed above  we earned net interest income of  and  respectively  on our invested cash and cash equivalents in and although our average invested balance increased significantly in april with our receipt of the materna litigation award  our weighted average per annum interest rate was for  lower than the rate in page expenses increase decrease increase decrease personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues general and administrative expenses patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements impairment losses on investments reversal of accounts payable exchanged for contingent note payable total expenses personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues decreased due to a combination of several factors only the more significant factors are discussed herein 
our personnel expenses for were  higher than for this increase includes higher bonus expense  a severance payment of  paid to our former chief financial officer  and recruiting expenses for new employees in in we also incurred increased expenses related to entering a patent in the mpeg licensing portfolio 
offsetting these increases  in our impairment charges on intangible assets acquired were  compared to  for  a reduction of  with the lower carrying value for our intangible assets acquired  our amortization expenses for were  lower than for  and we expect our amortization expense to be approximately  in and general and administrative expenses decreased in principally due to a decrease in our legal fees incurred in connection with the sec investigation and civil suit  which were  lower for than for  when the sec investigation was much more active 
we also reduced costs for our annual report  financial advisory and audit services 
we expect to incur higher expenses in future years to implement the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  reflect our level of activity and vary depending on the stage of the litigation 
our overall activity in the current year was less than in the prior year 
both years included enforcement in the labcorp and fujitsu litigations 
in addition to these two cases  we expect to incur enforcement expenses in to enforce our homocysteine assay patents with other infringers 
impairment losses on investments decreased in in we reviewed the fair value of our investment in innovation partners international  inc ipi  a japanese company  and determined that it was impaired 
while we continue to hold of ipi s outstanding voting shares  ipi continues to struggle for revenues and profitability 
therefore we recognized an impairment loss of  and reduced our carrying value for this investment to zero 
in we recorded an impairment charge of  to reduce our carrying value for our investment in ntru cryptosystems  inc to zero 
provision for benefit from income taxes we did not record an income tax provision in since we incurred a substantial net operating loss for income tax purposes 
this was due principally to the unilens receivable that had no basis for book purposes but was fully valued for income tax purposes 
as a result  the settlement with unilens in october generated a significant loss on an income tax basis  compared to income of  on a book basis 
in we did not record any income tax benefit since we incurred a net loss and could not conclude that the utilization of the income tax benefit in the future was more likely than not 
we have substantial federal and state operating and capital loss carryforwards to use against future regular taxable income 
in the fourth quarter of we revised our estimated federal alternative minimum tax liability and reversed the  provision that we had provided in the third quarter of page financial condition and liquidity our liquidity requirements arise principally from our working capital needs  including funds needed to find and obtain new technologies and to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  if necessary 
we fund our liquidity requirements with a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations  including royalty legal awards 
in addition  we have the ability to fund our liquidity requirements through sales of common stock under an equity financing arrangement see below 
at july   we had no outstanding debt or available credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid  interest earning investments with maturities when purchased of three months or less  including overnight bank deposits and money market funds 
we carry cash equivalents at cost  which approximates fair value 
during the year ended july   our financial position continued to improve  due to the increase in net income  collection of the unilens receivable  the sale of approximately  of our common stock pursuant to our equity financing arrangement see below  and the receipt of  from the exercise of stock options 
at july   cash and cash equivalents were  compared to  at july  cash provided by operating activities in was  compared to  in the increase in cash provided by operations in the current year principally was the result of the significantly higher net income in compared to cash provided by investing activities was  in  compared to  in the increase was due to higher collections on the unilens receivable  which was paid in full by the end of net cash provided by financing activities was  in  compared to a small use in the cash provided in was due to proceeds received from stock sales made pursuant to our equity financing arrangement see below  and cash received as the result of exercises of stock options 
in addition to fluctuations in the amounts of retained royalties revenues reported  changes in royalties receivable and payable reflect our normal cycle of royalty collections and payments 
funding and capital requirements equity financing on february   we entered into an agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital to sell up to million of our common stock to fusion capital over a twenty month period from the commencement date the stock sale agreement 
we have the right to determine the timing and the amount of stock sold  if any  to fusion capital 
we also have the right  in our sole discretion  to extend the term of the stock sale agreement by six months 
at our option and at any time until days after the termination of the stock sale agreement  we may elect to enter into a second agreement with fusion capital for the sale of an additional million of common stock on the same terms and conditions as the stock sale agreement 
pursuant to the stock sale agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to fusion capital for its initial commitment the initial shares  and agreed to issue  additional commitment shares to fusion capital on a pro rata basis as we sell the million of stock collectively  the commitment shares 
commencement of sales of common stock under the stock sale agreement was contingent upon certain conditions  principally the sec declaring effective our registration statement filed with the sec to register  shares of common stock potentially to be issued under the stock sale agreement 
on may   the sec declared our registration statement effective  which is the commencement date for the stock sale agreement 
page subject to our right to suspend sales of our common stock at any time and to terminate the stock sale agreement at any time  fusion capital is obligated to purchase up to  of our common stock each trading day the daily commitment amount 
the daily commitment amount may increase upon each increase in our stock price above per share 
the daily commitment amount also may decrease if our stock price drops below a floor price 
the floor price initially was set at per share and we may increase or decrease it from time to time  except that in no case shall it be less than per share 
the sale price per share will be the lower of the lowest sales price on the sale date or an average of the three lowest closing prices during the consecutive trading days prior to the sale date 
fusion capital may not purchase shares of our common stock under the stock sale agreement if fusion capital would beneficially own in excess of of our common stock outstanding at the time of purchase by fusion capital 
however  fusion capital is obligated to pay the daily commitment amount even though they may not receive additional shares until their beneficial ownership is less than the limitation 
fusion capital is free to sell its purchased shares at any time  and this would allow them to avoid the limitation  however  fusion capital has agreed not to sell the commitment shares until the earlier of october   months from february  or termination of the stock sale agreement 
in accordance with american stock exchange rules  we cannot issue more than  shares of our common stock including the commitment shares to fusion capital under the stock sale agreement without the prior approval of our shareholders 
until the termination of the stock sale agreement  we have agreed that we will not  without the prior written consent of fusion capital  contract for any equity financing including any debt financing with an equity component  or issue any floating conversion rate or variable priced equity or floating conversion rate or variable priced equity like securities 
in  we sold  shares and issued  commitment shares of our common stock to fusion capital for approximately  cumulatively  since inception in february and through july   we sold  shares and issued  commitment shares of our common stock to fusion capital for approximately  we plan to use the proceeds for general working capital needs 
in consideration for assisting us in arranging the transaction with fusion capital  we paid our financial advisor a success fee of  the success fee  which was of the total potential equity financing from fusion capital  and granted them warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock approximately of  shares  the estimated maximum number of shares that may be sold to fusion capital  excluding the commitment shares 
the warrants were exercisable upon receipt  at an exercise price of per share which was of the average closing price of our common stock for the day trading period ended january   that was used to determine the number of commitment shares 
on january   our advisor elected a cashless exercise pursuant to the terms of the warrant  and we issued  shares of common stock to them  after withholding  shares tendered as payment for the exercise price of the warrant 
we determined the number of shares to withhold based on a per share price of  which was the average per share price on january   the exercise date  in accordance with the warrant 
page in addition to the cash success fee  we incurred other cash costs related to the completion of the stock sale agreement  including professional fees  listing fees and due diligence costs 
we also incurred non cash costs for the estimated fair value of the initial shares  and the warrants issued to our financial advisor 
we capitalized all of the cash and non cash costs  aggregating  including  incurred in  as deferred financing costs  and have been amortizing the asset by charging the balance against capital in excess of par value on a pro rata basis as we sell shares to fusion capital  based upon the ratio of the proceeds received compared to our estimate of the total proceeds to be received over the life of the stock sale agreement 
we currently estimate we may change this estimate at any time that we will sell a total of  of common stock to fusion capital pursuant to the stock sale agreement and  accordingly  charged  for amortization against capital in excess of par value in the remaining balance of the deferred charges will be amortized against capital in excess of par value as we sell common stock to fusion capital in the future 
from july  through september   we sold  shares and issued  commitment shares of our common stock to fusion capital for approximately  and amortized approximately  of deferred charges against capital in excess of par value 
income taxes we currently have the benefit of using a portion of our accumulated nols to eliminate our regular federal and state income tax liabilities for fiscal we expect that we will be liable to pay only the federal amt for fiscal  and generally we can use of our nols to reduce our amt liability 
our effective income tax rate for the amt liability  which is less than  is much less than if we did not have the benefit of the nols and had to pay income taxes at our estimated effective income tax rate of 
we will continue to receive this benefit until we have utilized all of our nols federal and state 
however  we cannot determine when and if we will utilize the benefit of the remainder of our nols 
capital requirements as part of our strategic plan  we are exploring new business opportunities  including expanding our marketing capabilities on a more global basis  searching for new sources of technologies  and researching potential acquisition candidates in order to grow our business and increase shareholder value 
we expect this trend to continue 
other the amounts and timing of our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the results of our operations and marketing efforts  the results and costs of legal proceedings  and our equity financing 
to sustain profitability  we must license technologies with sufficient current and long term revenue streams  and we must continually add new licenses 
however  obtaining rights to new technologies  granting rights to licensees  enforcing intellectual property rights  and collecting royalty revenues are subject to many factors outside our control or that we cannot currently anticipate 
although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts  we believe that the combination of our cash on hand  the ability to raise funds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the stock sale agreement  and revenues from executing our strategic plan will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated operating cash requirements at least through fiscal page commitments and contractual obligations at july   our commitments were payments due by period at july  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations  principally rent purchase obligations any other commitments we may have either are contingent upon a future event or terminable on ninety days notice or less 
contingencies our directors  officers  employees and agents may claim indemnification in certain circumstances 
we are currently exposed to potential indemnification claims in connection with the sec civil suit  and with two complaints filed by certain former employees alleging discriminatory employment practices in violation of section of the corporate and criminal fraud accountability act of see item legal proceedings 
we seek to limit and reduce our potential financial obligations for indemnification by carrying directors and officers liability insurance subject to deductibles 
we also carry liability insurance  casualty insurance for owned or leased tangible assets  and other insurance as needed to cover us against potential and actual claims and lawsuits that occur in the ordinary course of our business 
many of our license and service agreements provide that we apply upfront license fees  license fees and or royalties we receive against amounts that our clients or we have incurred for patent application  prosecution  issuance and maintenance costs 
if we incur such costs  we expense them as we incur them  and reduce our expense if we are reimbursed from fees and or royalties we receive 
if the reimbursement belongs to our client  we record no revenue or expense 
as of july   ctt and its majority owned subsidiary  vector vision  inc vvi  have remaining obligations  contingent upon receipt of certain revenues  to repay up to  and  respectively  in consideration of grant funding received in and ctt also is obligated to pay at the rate of of its revenues  if any  from transferring rights to certain inventions supported by the grant funds 
vvi is obligated to pay at rates of of its net sales of supported products or of its revenues from licensing supported products  if any 
we recognize these obligations only if we receive revenues related to the grant funds 
no significant obligations were recognized in since the applicable revenues received were not significant 
currently  we engage three independent consultants who provide us with business development and evaluation services under contracts that are cancelable on up to sixty days written notice 
these contracts include contingencies for potential incentive compensation on sales 
for the years ended july   and  we neither accrued nor paid incentive compensation under such contracts since none was earned 
page on october   we signed an agreement making any further payments to our former patent litigation counsel in the fujitsu litigation completely contingent on future receipts from fujitsu 
this contingent obligation was reflected in a promissory note payable to our former patent litigation counsel for  plus simple interest at the annual rate of from the agreement date  payable only from future receipts  if any  in a settlement or other favorable outcome of the litigation against fujitsu 
as of july   the aggregate amount that we might pay under this note is approximately  including interest 
we must settle this contingent obligation before we record any revenue from future proceeds related to this litigation 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on the information available at the time and assumptions we believe are reasonable 
by their nature  estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to change at any time  and may depend on factors we cannot control 
as a result  if future events differ from our estimates  assumptions and judgments  we may need to adjust or revise them in later periods 
we believe the following significant estimates  assumptions and judgments we used in preparing our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our financial condition and operations 
upfront license fees received upfront license fees received in from new homocysteine licenses were recorded in retained royalties in accordance with our revenue recognition policies  which are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
abbott receivable included in receivables at july   is a receivable from abbott which will be paid partially in january and partially in january  as long as our homocysteine patent is valid and enforceable 
we do not believe that an allowance is required for this receivable and have not provided one 
valuation of palatin stock we accrued in receivables an amount representing the estimated value of the palatin common stock that we were owed on the day that the settlement with palatin was reached  and then discounted that value to reflect the impact of the current restriction on selling the shares 
valuation of epitan stock in  we received two stock dividends of epitan common stock from our investee  melanotan 
in both cases  as a condition to receiving the dividends  we agreed not to sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares before october  for the first dividend  received in october  we estimated the fair value of the  shares of epitan common stock using the closing price of the shares per share  australian dollars and the exchange rate for converting australian dollars to us dollars australian dollars to us dollar on the date that melanotan s board of directors approved the dividend 
we then discounted the value of the shares using a discount factor to recognize the estimated impact of the sale restriction epitan has minimal revenues and has incurred substantial current and accumulated net losses 
we recorded the estimated value of the shares   as dividend income and included the asset in equity securities held for sale 
page the second stock dividend was received in june we valued the shares and dividend received in the same manner as the october dividend  except that the price per share of the  shares of epitan common stock was australian dollars at the time of the dividend  and the conversion rate was australian dollars to us dollar 
we then discounted the result  resulting in a dividend valued at  in total  we received and now directly own  shares of epitan common stock 
market gains and losses and currency exchange fluctuation gains and losses related to the epitan shares from the date of receipt to the balance sheet date are aggregated and recorded as part of other comprehensive income or loss included as a component of shareholders interest  since we believe that the decline is temporary 
we recorded the value of the shares as a non current asset  as we currently plan to hold the shares as a long term investment 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement established standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  focusing primarily on employee services exchanged for an award of equity instruments  including stock options 
it requires entities to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards over the requisite service period generally the vesting period 
we will adopt the provisions of this statement beginning august   utilizing the modified prospective application as defined in the statement  whereby beginning august   we will recognize compensation expense for the estimated fair value of new awards and of any awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after june   over their respective requisite service periods 
we also will recognize compensation expense for awards previously issued and outstanding that vest after august   over their respective remaining vesting periods 
the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and our results of operations 
for outstanding but unvested awards at july   we currently estimate that we will record compensation expense of approximately  and  respectively  in fiscal and  excluding any expense that must be recognized for stock options granted after july  related party transactions our board of directors determined that when a director s services are outside the normal duties of a director  we compensate the director at the rate of  per day  plus expenses which is the same amount we pay a director for attending a one day board meeting 
we classify these amounts as consulting expenses included in personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues 
we incurred charges for consulting services including expenses and use taxes provided by one director of   and  respectively  in  and risk factors we derived more than of our retained royalties in fiscal from four technologies 
we derived approximately  or  of retained royalties from four technologies  or  from the homocysteine assay   or  from ethyol   or  from gallium arsenide patents and  or  from sexual dysfunction patents 
in fiscal  we derived approximately of our retained royalties from the same four technologies 
page our us patent that covers the homocysteine assay expires in july of the  of homocysteine assay royalties  approximately  were for non refundable  non creditable  up front royalty fees 
the remaining  includes revenues from many new licenses which did not accrue revenue for a full year in our retained royalties from ethyol are limited to a maximum of  per calendar year  and since calendar we have received the maximum 
we expect ethyol retained royalties to continue at their level for several years this patent expires in december 
certain of the gallium arsenide patents have expired and we expect less retained royalties from gallium arsenide in the future see below 
retained royalties from the sexual dysfunction license include the settlement of a mediated dispute 
such a concentration of revenues makes our operations vulnerable to changes in any one of them  especially the homocysteine assay  and such changes could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position 
certain of our licensed patents have recently expired or will expire in the near future and we may not be able to replace their royalty revenues 
in fiscal  we derived retained royalties from licenses on twenty four patented technologies 
we expect royalties from twelve of those patented technologies to expire in the next five years 
those patented technologies represented approximately of our retained royalties in fiscal fiscal retained royalty revenues of approximately  or   or  and  or  respectively  were from patents expiring in fiscal  and the loss of these royalties  especially the homocysteine assay  may materially  adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to replace them with revenue from other licenses or other sources 
since it often takes two or more years for a technology to produce significant revenues  we must continuously seek new sources of future revenues 
we depend on our relationships with inventors to gain access to new technologies and inventions 
if we fail to maintain existing relationships or to develop new relationships  we may have fewer technologies and inventions available to generate revenues 
in addition  technology can change rapidly and industry standards are continually evolving 
this often makes products obsolete  or results in short product lifecycles 
our profitability also depends on our licensees ability to adapt to such changes 
we do not invent new technologies or products ourselves 
we depend on relationships with universities  corporations  governmental agencies  research institutions  inventors  and others to provide us with technology based opportunities that we can develop into profitable royalty bearing licenses 
our failure to maintain these relationships or to develop new relationships could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to forge new relationships or to maintain our current relationships  we may be unable to identify new technology based opportunities and royalty bearing licenses 
we also are dependent on our clients abilities to develop new technologies  introduce new products  and adapt to changes in technology and economic needs 
further  we cannot be certain that our current or any new relationships will provide the volume or quality of available new technologies necessary to sustain our business 
in some cases  universities and other sources of new technologies may compete against us as they seek to develop and commercialize these technologies themselves  or through entities that they develop  finance and or control 
in other cases  universities receive financing for basic research from companies in exchange for the exclusive right to commercialize any resulting inventions 
these and other strategies may reduce the number of technology sources potential clients to whom we can market our services 
if we are unable to secure new sources of technology  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
page we receive most of our revenues from customers over whom we have no control 
we rely on royalties received from our customers for revenues 
the royalties we receive from our customers depend on their efforts and expenditures and we have no control over their efforts or expenditures 
additionally  our customers development of new products involves great risk since many new technologies do not become commercially profitable products despite extensive development efforts 
our license agreements do not require customers to advise us of problems they may encounter in attempting to develop commercial products and they usually treat such information as confidential 
you should expect our customers to encounter problems frequently 
our customers failure to resolve such problems may result in a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
strong competition within our industry may reduce our client base 
we compete with universities  law firms  venture capital firms and other technology commercialization firms for technology licensing opportunities 
many organizations offer some aspect of technology transfer services  and some are well established and have more financial and human resources than we do 
this market is highly fragmented and participants frequently focus on a specific technology area 
in three of the last five fiscal years  we have experienced significant net losses 
the table below summarizes our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the five years ended july  net income loss net cash flow from operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents although we have generated significant net income and positive cash flows in fiscal and  we can not be sure that this trend will continue 
we incurred substantial net losses in the three years ending july   principally from low revenues and expenses related to patent enforcement litigation  which we have since reduced significantly 
to sustain profitability  we must successfully license technologies with current and long term revenue streams  and we must continually add new such licenses 
in addition  we must control our costs  including litigation related costs 
in addition  our future royalty revenues  obtaining rights to new technologies  granting licenses  enforcing intellectual property rights  and profits or losses are subject to many factors outside our control  or that we currently cannot anticipate  including technological changes and developments  economic cycles  and the ability of our licensees to commercialize our technologies successfully 
consequently  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to be profitable 
although we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts  we believe that our business plan and capital resources will sustain us at least through fiscal page a former chief executive officer and ctt have been named in a civil suit filed by the sec

page sales of our common stock to fusion capital will cause dilution to current stockholders and fusion capital s resale of those shares of common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in february we entered into an agreement with fusion capital to sell up to million of our common stock to fusion capital over a twenty month period from the commencement date  subject to certain limitations and extensions 
the purchase price for the common stock to be issued to fusion capital pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement fluctuates based on the price of our common stock 
the purchase price per share is equal to the lesser of i the lowest sale price of our common stock on the purchase date or ii the average of the three lowest closing sale prices of our common stock during the twelve consecutive trading days prior to the date of a purchase by fusion capital 
pursuant to a registration statement filed with the sec  all shares sold to fusion capital are freely tradeable 
fusion capital may sell none  some or all of the shares of common stock purchased from us at any time 
we expect that fusion capital will resell any shares that they purchase over a period of up to twenty months from the commencement date may  of the agreement  subject to a six month extension or earlier termination at our discretion 
depending upon market liquidity at the time  a sale of shares by fusion capital at any given time could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the anticipation of such sales  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at a price at which we might otherwise wish to effect sales 
there are  shares of our common stock registered for sale by fusion capital excluding  commitment shares that have been issued fusion capital and the additional commitment shares that are issuable to fusion capital under the agreement 
through july   we sold  shares to fusion capital 
we have the right  but not the obligation  to sell additional shares to fusion capital under the common stock purchase agreement 
the remaining  of these registered shares equaled approximately ten percent of our outstanding shares of common stock at july  in addition to the  shares that were issued to fusion capital as an initial commitment fee  we have issued  shares and may issue an additional  shares to fusion capital as we sell shares to fusion capital 
since july  through september   we sold  shares and issued  commitment shares of our common stock to fusion capital for  and amortized  of deferred charges against capital in excess of par value 
the sale of shares to fusion capital may result in significant dilution to the ownership interests of other holders of our common stock 
the amount of dilution would be higher if the per share market price of our common stock is lower at the time we sell shares to fusion capital  since a lower market price would cause more shares of our common stock to be issued to fusion capital for the same proceeds 
subsequent sales of these shares in the open market by fusion capital may also have the effect of lowering our stock price  thereby increasing the number of shares issuable to them under the common stock purchase agreement and consequently further diluting our outstanding shares 
although we have the right to reduce or suspend sales to fusion capital at any time  our financial condition at the time may require us to waive our right to suspend purchases even if there is a decline in the market price 
furthermore  the dilution caused by the issuance of shares to fusion capital may cause other shareholders to elect to sell their shares of our common stock  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease 
in addition  prospective investors anticipating the downward pressure on the price of our common stock due to the shares available for sale by fusion capital could refrain from purchases or cause sales or short sales in anticipation of a decline of the market price  which may itself cause the price of our stock to decline 
page our revenue growth depends on our ability to understand the technology requirements of our customers in the context of their markets 
if we fail to understand their technology needs or markets  we limit our ability to meet those needs and to generate revenues 
we believe that by focusing on the technology needs of our customers  we are better positioned to generate revenues by providing them technology solutions 
in this way  the market demands of our customers drive our revenues 
the better we understand their markets and requirements  the better we are able to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for our customers 
currently  we rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to understand our customers technical  commercial  and market requirements and constraints  and to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for them 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
our success depends on the knowledge  efforts and abilities of a small number of key personnel

freed is our president and chief executive officer  michael d 
davidson is our vice president and chief financial officer  dr 
michael kiley is our executive vice president and chief technology officer  and paul a 
levitsky is our vice president  general counsel  and corporate secretary 
we rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to identify intellectual property opportunities and technology solutions  and to negotiate and close license agreements 
competition for personnel with the necessary breadth and depth of experience is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if we were unable to hire and retain highly qualified professionals and consultants  especially with our small number of staff  our revenues  prospects  financial condition and future activities could be materially adversely affected 
our customers  and therefore we  depend on receiving government approvals to exploit certain licensed products commercially 
commercial exploitation of some licensed patents may require the approval of governmental regulatory agencies  especially in the life sciences area  and there is no assurance that those agencies will grant such approvals 
in the united states  the principal governmental agency involved is the us food and drug administration fda 
the fda s approval process is rigorous  time consuming and costly 
unless and until a licensee obtains approval for a product requiring such approval  the licensee may not sell the product in the usa  and therefore we will not receive royalty income based on usa sales of the product 
if our clients and we are unable to protect the intellectual property underlying our licenses  or to enforce our patents adequately  we may be unable to exploit such licensed patents or technologies successfully 
our success in earning revenues from licenses is subject to the risk that issued patents may be declared invalid  that patents may not issue on patent applications  or that competitors may circumvent or infringe our licensed patents and thereby render our licensed patents not commercially viable 
in addition  when all patents underlying a license expire  our royalties from that license cease  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace those royalties with royalty revenues from new or other licenses 
patent litigation has increased  it can be expensive and may delay or prevent our customers products from entering the market 
our clients and or we may pursue patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings against sellers of products that we believe infringe our patent rights 
holders of conflicting patents or sellers of competing products also may challenge our patents in patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings 
for a description of proceedings in which we are currently involved  see item legal proceedings 
page we cannot assure you that our clients and or we will be successful in any such litigation or proceeding  and the results and costs of such litigation or proceeding may materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
developing new products  creating effective commercialization strategies for technologies  and enhancing those products and strategies are subject to inherent risks 
these risks include unanticipated delays  unrecoverable expenses  technical problems or difficulties  and the possibility that development funds will be insufficient 
the occurrence of any one or more of these risks could make us abandon or substantially change our technology commercialization strategy 
our success depends on  among other factors  our clients developing new or improved technologies  our customers products meeting targeted cost and performance objectives for large scale production  and our customers ability to adapt technologies to satisfy industry standards  satisfy consumer expectations and needs  and bring their products to market before the market is saturated 
they may encounter unanticipated technical or other problems that result in increased costs or substantial delays in introducing and marketing new products 
current and future products may not be reliable or durable under actual operating conditions or otherwise commercially viable and competitive 
new products may not satisfy price or other performance objectives when introduced in the marketplace 
any of these events would adversely affect our realization of royalties from such new products 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since  and  our board of directors currently does not have plans to declare or pay cash dividends in the future 
however  the decision to pay dividends is solely at the discretion of our board of directors based upon factors that they deem relevant  and may change at any time 
as a publicly held company  we have significantly higher administrative costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec and new listing requirements subsequently adopted by the american stock exchange in response to the sarbanes oxley act of  have required changes in corporate governance practices  internal control policies and audit committee practices of public companies 
these new rules  regulations  and requirements have significantly increased our legal  audit  financial  compliance and administrative costs  and have made certain other activities more time consuming and costly 
the additional costs are expected to continue 
in addition  these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors and officers liability insurance in the future  and could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee
