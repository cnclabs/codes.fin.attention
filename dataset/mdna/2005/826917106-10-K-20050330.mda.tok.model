item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
overview since our inception in december  we have been principally engaged in the research and development of novel products for the prevention and treatment of serious infectious diseases  including products for use in the defense against biological warfare agents such as smallpox and arenaviruses 
the effort to develop a drug for smallpox is being aided by sbir grants from the nih totaling approximately million that were awarded in the third quarter of and a million contract with the us army which began in january the arenavirus program is being supported by sbir grants from the nih totaling approximately million that were awarded in the third quarter of our anti viral programs are designed to prevent or limit the replication of the viral pathogen 
our anti infectives programs are aimed at the increasingly serious problem of drug resistance 
these programs are designed to block the ability of bacteria to attach to human tissue  the first step in the infection process 
we are also developing a technology for the mucosal delivery of our vaccines which may allow the vaccines to activate the immune system at the mucus lined surfaces of the body the mouth  the nose  the lungs and the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts the sites of entry for most infectious agents 
we do not have commercial biomedical products  and we do not expect to have such products for several years  if at all 
we believe that we will need additional funds to complete the development of our biomedical products 
our plans with regard to these matters include continued development of our products as well as seeking additional research support funds and financial arrangements 
although we continue to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on terms acceptable to us 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
management believes it has sufficient funds and projected cash flows to support operations beyond december  our biotechnology operations are run out of our research facility in corvallis  oregon 
we continue to seek to fund a major portion of our ongoing antiviral  antibiotic and vaccine programs through a combination of government grants and strategic alliances 
while we have had success in obtaining strategic alliances and grants  no assurance can be given that we will continue to be successful in obtaining funds from these sources 
until additional relationships are established  we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs and costs associated with the manufacturing of product for use in clinical trials and pre clinical testing 
it is expected that general and administrative costs  including patent and regulatory costs  necessary to support clinical trials and research and development will continue to be significant in the future 
to date  we have not marketed  or generated revenues from the commercial sale of any products 
our biopharmaceutical product candidates are not expected to be commercially available for several years  if at all 
accordingly  we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitable operations 
critical accounting estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements  which we discuss under the heading results of operations following this section of our md a 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of recoverability of goodwill  which impacts goodwill impairments  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating income when we impair intangible assets 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
significant accounting policies the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of all of the significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab 
in accordance with sab  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  contractual obligations have been satisfied and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from non refundable up front payments  not tied to achieving a specific performance milestone  over the period which the company is obligated to perform services or based on the percentage of costs incurred to date  estimated costs to complete and total expected contract revenue 
payments for development activities are recognized as revenue is earned  over the period of effort 
substantive at risk milestone payments  which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due  providing there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone 
in situations where the company receives payment in advance of the performance of services  such amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as the related services are performed 
goodwill goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the company performs an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step approach in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value 
in  the company operated as one business and one reporting unit 
therefore  the goodwill impairment analysis was performed on the basis of the company as a whole using the market capitalization of the company as an estimate of its fair value 
the estimated fair values might produce significantly different results if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used 
identified intangible assets acquisition related intangibles include acquired technology  customer contracts  grants and covenants not to compete  and are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the company performs a review of its identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if such facts and circumstances do exist  the company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method  and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
the requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of sfas no 
or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating these transition methods 
in march  the emerging issues task force issued eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 

this statement provides additional guidance on the calculation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share 
the fasb concluded in eitf that companies with multiple classes of common stock or participating securities  as defined by sfas no 
 calculate and disclose earnings per share based on the two class method 
the adoption of this statement did not have an impact to our financial statements presentation as the company is in a loss position 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated revenue selling  general and administrative research and development patent preparation fees in process research and development impairment of intangible assets operating loss years ended december   and revenues from grants and research and development contracts approximated  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the approximate increase is the result of the award of two phase i and two phase ii sbir grants by the nih during the third quarter of the phase ii grants are for a two year period ending in the third quarter of the total grant award was for approximately million 
for the year ended december  we recorded revenue of  from these grants 
we also received a one year sbir grant from the nih for  in august to support our strep vaccine program 
for the year ended december  we recorded revenue of  from this grant 
revenue from our contract with the us army was  for  compared to  for the year ended december  the approximate increase was due to the higher budget for work performed in for the year ended december  we received revenue of  from an sbir grant for our degp anti infective that we completed in the second quarter of for the year ended december  we received  from this grant 
revenue of  for the year ended december  was approximately higher than revenue of  for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  from the prior year reflects  in revenue from the first year of our million contract with the us army for our work on the development of a smallpox drug 
revenue from our phase ii small business innovation research sbir grant also increased 
revenue from the sbir grant for the year ended december  was approximately  an approximate increase over the year ended december  the sbir grant  which was a two year grant for a total of  ended on may  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to expenses of  for the year ended december  the increase of  or approximately  was primarily due to an increase of  in payroll expense  and a  increase in legal expenses 
payroll expenses increased by approximately primarily due to the addition of a chief executive officer and a vice president business development  bonuses paid to employees  and the costs associated with the termination of the employment agreement with our former president 
the increase in legal expenses of from was the result of the costs incurred to review and amend our corporate governance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the regulations promulgated under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as the nasdaq stock market 
also contributing to the increase in legal expenses were the costs incurred in connection with a potential business combination  the sale of certain non core vaccine assets  the hiring of our new ceo  a legal action that we initiated against a former founder and the work performed relative to the acquisition of certain assets and grants from viropharma 
increases in travel expense  rent  amortization and filing fees were offset by decreases in depreciation  insurance and miscellaneous expenses 
the  of selling  general and administrative expenses incurred for the year ended december  represented an increase of approximately from an expense of  for the year ended december  of the  increase  approximately  was the result of higher consulting expenses associated with our marketing program to find additional sources of government grant and contract funding and increased investor relations efforts 
approximately  of the increase was the result of increased payroll expense reflecting the administrative employees who were added in connection with the acquisition of substantially all the assets of plexus 
in addition  the year ended december  included non cash expenses of approximately  associated with the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the plexus transaction 
these increases were partially offset by lower legal and accounting fees 
for the year ended december  legal and accounting fees were approximately  higher than the expenses incurred in as the result of work done in on a proposed merger 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   an increase of approximately from the  of expenses incurred for the year ended december  amortization expense of  represented approximately of the increase 
these expenses were the result of the acquisition of certain assets from plexus in and viropharma in payroll expenses increased approximately to  for from  incurred in the increase was the result of the expansion of staff to service the grants acquired from viropharma and bonuses paid to employees 
sponsored research increased by approximately in to  from  in the increase was the result of payments made to a danish university for former plexus programs  a payment made to transtech pharma for work performed on an sbir grant that was completed in the second quarter and payments to oregon state university for work on the strep grant received in expenses for lab supplies increased approximately to  from  as a result of accelerated development of our lead product programs 
for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased approximately to  from  for the same period in approximately  of the increase was the result of higher payroll expense caused by the addition of plexus r d personnel as well as additional staffing for our ongoing smallpox and anti infectives programs 
for the year ended december  we recognized non cash charges of approximately  for the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired from plexus  no similar charges were recognized in the prior year 
in addition  lab supply expenses were approximately  an increase of approximately in the year ended december  from the prior year spending level of approximately  the increase reflects increased activity on our smallpox and degp programs 
sponsored research increased to approximately  an increase from the prior year 
the increase was due to payment for work being performed on former plexus programs at a danish university 
all of our product programs are in the early stage of development 
at this stage of development  we cannot make estimates of the potential cost for any program to be completed or the time it will take to complete the project 
there is a high risk of non completion of any program because of the lead time to program completion and uncertainty of the costs 
net cash inflows from any products developed from these programs is at least one to three years away 
however  we could receive additional grants  contracts or technology licenses in the short term 
the potential cash and timing is not known and we cannot be certain if they will ever occur 
the risk of failure to complete any program is high  as each is in the relatively early stage of development 
products for the biological warfare defense market  such as the smallpox anti viral  could be available for sale in one to three years 
we believe the products directed toward this market are on schedule 
we expect the future research and development cost of this program to increase as the potential products enter animal studies and safety testing 
funds for future development will be partially paid for by nih sbir grants  the contract we have with the us army  additional government funding and from future financing 
if we are unable to obtain additional federal grants and contracts or funding in the required amounts  the development timeline for these products would slow or possibly be suspended 
the clinical trials for our strep vaccine through phase ii would be funded under an agreement with the nih 
the time to market for this product should be several years from now because of the nature of the fda requirements for approval of a pediatric vaccine 
we expect to fund the development of the strep vaccine beyond the phase ii clinical trials through a corporate collaboration or from additional funding from debt or equity financings 
we do not yet have a corporate partner for this product and there is no assurance that we will ever have one or that we will be able to raise the funds needed to go forward 
if the funding is not available or the clinical trials are not successful  the program could be delayed or cancelled 
we believe this product program is on schedule 
delay or suspension of any of our programs could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise funds in the future  enter into collaborations with corporate partners or obtain additional federal funding from contracts or grants 
patent preparation expenses for the year ended december  were  an approximate increase from expenses of  incurred in the increase was the result of increased costs arising from the plexus and viropharma asset acquisitions 
the  of expense incurred in was an approximate increase over the  expense incurred in  the result of increased costs of patent work required on the intellectual property acquired in the plexus transaction  including foreign patent filings 
for the year ended december   as a result of the acquisition of certain government grants and two early stage antiviral programs  smallpox and arenavirus  targeting certain agents of biological warfare  from viropharma   was immediately expensed as purchased in process research and development iprd 
the amount expensed as iprd was attributed to technology that has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternate future use 
the value allocated to iprd was determined using the income approach that included an excess earnings analysis reflecting the appropriate costs of capital for the purchase 
estimates of future cash flows related to the iprd were made for both the smallpox and arenavirus programs 
the aggregate discount rate of approximately utilized to discount the programs cash flows were based on consideration of the company s weighted average cost of capital  as well as other factors  including the stage of completion and the uncertainty of technology advances for these programs 
if the programs are not successful or completed in a timely manner  the company s product pricing and growth rates may not be achieved and the company may not realize the financial benefits expected from the programs 
for the year ended december  we recorded a  non cash loss on impairment of assets 
in december  upon completion of the viropharma transaction  integration of the related acquired programs into the company s operations  and the demonstrated antiviral activity of the company s lead smallpox compound against several mouse models of poxvirus disease  we commenced an application process for additional government grants to support our continued efforts under the smallpox and arenavirus antiviral programs 
we determined that significant efforts and resources will be necessary to successfully continue the development efforts under these programs and decided to allocate the necessary resources to support its commitment 
as a result  limited resources will be available for the development of future product candidates that utilize the technology acquired from plexus in may these factors resulted in a significant reduction in forecasted revenues related to that technology and a reduction in the future remaining useful life  and triggered the related intangible asset impairment 
the amount of impairment recorded by us in december was determined using the two step process impairment review as required by sfas in the first step  we compared the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the technology acquired from plexus over its remaining life against its carrying amount 
we determined that the carrying amount of the technology acquired from plexus exceeded its projected undiscounted cash flows 
in the second step  we estimated the fair value of the technology using the income method of valuation  which included the use of estimated discounted cash flows 
based on our assessment  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million in december  which was included as a component of our operating loss 
in may  we performed an impairment review of our intangible assets in accordance with sfas in connection with the sale of certain intangible assets from our immunological bioinformatics technology and certain non core vaccine development to a privately held company  pecos labs  inc pecos 
we recorded an impairment charge of  to the grants transferred to pecos and  to the covenant not to compete with our president who was terminated during the current year period 
for the year ended december   we incurred a loss on impairment of assets as a result of taking a non cash charge of  to the intangible assets acquired in the plexus transaction to reflect the termination of a research agreement 
no similar charge was incurred in total operating loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss of  for of the current loss   was the result of non cash charges incurred for the impairment of assets and recognition of in process research and development expense 
excluding these expenses  the current year loss was approximately higher than the prior year 
the increase in the loss was due to higher selling  general and administrative expenses  higher research and development expenses and higher patent costs as described in detail above 
these increases were partially offset by increased revenue 
total operating loss for the year ended december  was  an approximate increase from the  loss incurred for the year ended december  the increase in the loss is the result of higher selling  general and administration expenses and research and development expenses as described above  partially offset by higher revenues 
approximately of the increase in the net loss was the result of non cash charges incurred in the year ended december  other income was  in the year ended december  an increase of approximately from the  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to interest income related to higher cash balances during compared to in we also received other income of  as the result of the settlement of a legal action with a former founder 
other income of  for the year ended december  was approximately lower than the  recognized for the year ended december  and reflected a reduction in interest income due to lower cash balances and interest yields in the year ended december  compared to prior year 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that these funds and our projected cash flows are sufficient to support our operations beyond december   and that sufficient cash flows will be available to meet our business objectives 
in august  we acquired certain government grants and two early stage antiviral programs  smallpox and arenavirus  targeting certain agents of biological warfare from viropharma for a purchase price of  in cash and  shares of our common stock 
as part of the closing  we were awarded phase i and ii sbir grants from the nih totaling approximately million  which will be received over the next two years  for the development of drugs for the treatment of smallpox and arenavirus as noted above 
in may  we sold intangible assets from our immunological bioinformatics technology and certain non core vaccine development assets to a privately held company  pecos labs  inc pecos in exchange for  shares of pecos common stock 
as a result of this transaction  we performed an impairment review of the intangible assets and concluded that the carrying amount of certain transferred intangible assets of  would not be recoverable 
in addition  we terminated our employment agreement with our president 
we paid approximately  in severance to our former president as well as accelerated vesting on  stock options that were due to vest in may no compensation charge was recorded as the exercise price of the options was above the fair value market price on the date of termination 
in addition  we reduced the covenant not to compete with our former president to one year from the date of termination 
we recognized  of impairment to the unamortized covenant not to compete with our former president due to the reduction of the covenant to one year from the date of termination 
in august  we entered into an agreement with macandrews forbes holdings inc macandrews forbes  a holding company of which the company s chairman of the board of directors is vice chairman and a director 
upon consummation of the agreement  macandrews forbes and its permitted assignees invested an initial  in siga in exchange for  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
macandrews forbes and its permitted assignees also received an option  exercisable through october   to invest up to an additional  in siga on the same terms 
upon exercise of the option in october  we received gross proceeds of  in exchange for  shares of common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
in january  upon approval of the company s shareholders  macandrews forbes and its permitted assignees invested the remaining  in exchange for  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
all warrants issued under the agreement have a term of seven years 
in june  the company raised gross proceeds of million in a private offering of  shares of common stock 
in connection with the offering  the company issued warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock to placement agents 
the warrants are exercisable at a price of per share and have a term of five years 
in may  we acquired substantially all of the assets of plexus in exchange for  shares of our common stock and the assumption of certain liabilities  including promissory notes for loans we previously made to plexus for  and  in december and january  we completed a private placement of units consisting of million shares of common stock to a group of private investors 
the gross proceeds from the offering were  with net proceeds to siga of approximately  we anticipate that our current resources will be sufficient to finance our currently anticipated needs for operating and capital expenditures approximately beyond december  in addition  we will attempt to generate additional working capital through a combination of collaborative agreements  strategic alliances  research grants  equity and debt financing 
however  no assurance can be provided that additional capital will be obtained through these sources or  if obtained  will be on commercially reasonable terms 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including pharmaceutical research and development programs  pre clinical and clinical testing  timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  levels of resources that we devote to the development of manufacturing and marketing capabilities  technological advances  status of competitors  and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and purchase obligations as of december   our purchase obligations are not material 
we lease certain facilities and office space under operating leases 
minimum future rental commitments under operating leases having non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows year ended december  total  off balance sheet arrangements siga does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition this report contains forward looking statements and other prospective information relating to future events 
these forward looking statements and other information are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results including the following we have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect to incur net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   and  our accumulated deficit was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenditures 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
we cannot guarantee that we will achieve sufficient revenues for profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we cannot guarantee that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if revenues grow slower than we anticipate  or if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  then our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
because our strategy might include acquisitions of other businesses  acquisition expenses and any cash used to make these acquisitions will reduce our available cash 
our business will suffer if we are unable to raise additional equity funding 
we continue to be dependent on our ability to raise money in the equity markets 
there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in raising such funds 
if we are unable to raise additional equity funds  we may be forced to discontinue or cease certain operations 
we currently have sufficient operating capital to finance our operations beyond december  our annual operating needs vary from year to year depending upon the amount of revenue generated through grants and licenses and the amount of projects we undertake  as well as the amount of resources we expend  in connection with acquisitions all of which may materially differ from year to year and may adversely affect our business 
our stock price is  and we expect it to remain  volatile  which could limit investors ability to sell stock at a profit 
the volatile price of our stock makes it difficult for investors to predict the value of their investment  to sell shares at a profit at any given time  or to plan purchases and sales in advance 
a variety of factors may affect the market price of our common stock 
these include  but are not limited to o publicity regarding actual or potential clinical results relating to products under development by our competitors or us  o delay or failure in initiating  completing or analyzing pre clinical or clinical trials or the unsatisfactory design or results of these trials  o achievement or rejection of regulatory approvals by our competitors or us  o announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us  o developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents  o developments concerning our collaborations  o regulatory developments in the united states and foreign countries  o economic or other crises and other external factors  o period to period fluctuations in our revenues and other results of operations  o changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and o sales of our common stock 
additionally  because there is not a high volume of trading in our stock  any information about siga in the media may result in significant volatility in our stock price 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for biotechnology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that may have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
we are in various stages of product development and there can be no assurance of successful commercialization 
in general  our research and development programs are at an early stage of development 
our biological warfare defense products do not need human clinical trials for approval by the fda 
we will need to perform two animal models and provide safety data for a product to be approved 
our other products will be subject to the approval guidelines under fda regulatory requirements which include a number of phases of testing in humans 
the fda has not approved any of our biopharmaceutical product candidates 
any drug candidates developed by us will require significant additional research and development efforts  including extensive pre clinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval  prior to commercial sale 
we cannot be sure our approach to drug discovery will be effective or will result in the development of any drug 
we cannot expect that any drugs resulting from our research and development efforts will be commercially available for many years  if at all 
we have limited experience in conducting pre clinical testing and clinical trials 
even if we receive initially positive pre clinical or clinical results  such results do not mean that similar results will be obtained in the later stages of drug development  such as additional pre clinical testing or human clinical trials 
all of our potential drug candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that none of our drug candidates will or can o be safe  non toxic and effective  o otherwise meet applicable regulatory standards  o receive the necessary regulatory approvals  o develop into commercially viable drugs  o be manufactured or produced economically and on a large scale  o be successfully marketed  o be reimbursed by government and private insurers  and o achieve customer acceptance 
in addition  third parties may preclude us from marketing our drugs through enforcement of their proprietary rights  that we are not aware of  or third parties may succeed in marketing equivalent or superior drug products 
our failure to develop safe  commercially viable drugs would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our immediately foreseeable future revenues are contingent upon grants from the united states government  and collaborative and license agreements and we may not achieve sufficient revenues from these agreements to attain profitability 
until and unless we successfully make a product  our ability to generate revenues will largely depend on our ability to enter into additional collaborative and license agreements with third parties and maintain the agreements we currently have in place 
substantially all of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from revenues related to grants  contracts and license agreements 
we will receive little or no revenues under our collaborative agreements if our collaborators research  development or marketing efforts are unsuccessful  or if our agreements are terminated early 
additionally  if we do not enter into new collaborative agreements  we will not receive future revenues from new sources 
our future revenue is substantially dependent on the continuing grant and contract work being performed for the nih under two major grants which expire in september and the us army which expires at the end of december these agreements are for specific work to be performed under the agreements and could only be canceled by the other party thereto for non performance by the other party thereto 
several factors will affect our future receipt of revenues from collaborative arrangements  including the amount of time and effort expended by our collaborators  the timing of the identification of useful drug targets and the timing of the discovery and development of drug candidates 
under our existing agreements  we may not earn significant milestone payments until our collaborators have advanced products into clinical testing  which may not occur for many years  if at all 
we have material agreements with the following collaborators o national institutes of health 
under our collaborative agreement with the nih we have received sbir grants totaling approximately million in the term of these grants expire in september we are paid as the work is performed and the agreement can be cancelled for non performance 
we also have an agreement whereby the nih is required to conduct and pay for the clinical trials of our strep vaccine product through phase ii human trials 
the nih can terminate the agreement on days written notice 
if terminated  we receive copies of all data  reports and other information related to the trials 
if terminated  we would have to find another source of funds to continue to conduct the trials 
we are current in all our obligations under our agreements 
o the rockefeller university 
the term of our agreement with rockefeller is for the duration of the patents and a number of pending patents 
as we do not currently know when any patents pending or future patents will expire  we cannot at this time definitively determine the term of this agreement 
the agreement can be terminated earlier if we are in breach of the provisions of the agreement and do not cure the breach in the allowed cure period 
we are current in all obligations under the contract 
o oregon state university osu 
osu is a signatory of our agreement with rockefeller 
the term of this agreement is for the duration of the patents and a number of pending patents 
as we do not currently know when any patents pending or future patents will expire  we cannot at this time definitively determine the term of this agreement 
the agreement can be terminated earlier if we are in breach of the provisions of the agreement and do not cure the breach in the allowed cure period 
we are current in all obligations under the contract 
we have also entered into a subcontract agreement with osu for us to perform work under a grant osu has from the nih 
the subcontract agreement was renewable annually and the current terms expired on august  work on this agreement was completed in o wyeth 
our license agreement expires on the earlier of june  or the last to expire patent that we have sub licensed to them 
wyeth has the right to terminate the agreement on days written notice 
if terminated  all rights granted to wyeth will revert to us  except for any compound identified by wyeth prior to the date of termination and subject to the milestones and royalty obligations of the agreement 
o washington university 
we have licensed certain technology from washington under a non exclusive license agreement 
the term of our agreement with washington is for the duration of the patents and a number of pending patents 
as we do not currently know when any patents pending or future patents will expire  we cannot at this time definitively determine the term of this agreement 
the agreement cannot be terminated unless we fail to pay our share of the joint patent costs for the technology licensed 
we have currently met all our obligations under this agreement 
o regents of the university of california 
we have licensed certain technology from regents under an exclusive license agreement 
we are required to pay minimum royalties under this agreement 
this agreement is related to our agreement with wyeth and expires at the same time as that agreement 
it can be cancelled earlier if we default on our obligations or if wyeth cancels its agreement with siga and we are not able to find a replacement for wyeth 
we have currently met all our obligations under this agreement 
o us army medical research acquisition activity 
in december  we entered into a four years contract with the us army medical research acquisition activity usamraa to develop a drug to treat smallpox 
we are current in all our obligations under our agreement 
o transtech pharma  inc under our collaborative agreement with transtech pharma  transtech pharma is required to collaborate with us on the discovery  optimization and development of lead compounds to therapeutic agents 
we and transtech pharma have agreed to share the costs of development and revenues generated from licensing and profits from any commercialized products sales 
the agreement will be in effect until terminated by the parties or upon cessation of research or sales of all products developed under the agreement 
we are current in all obligations under this agreement 
the biopharmaceutical market in which we compete and will compete is highly competitive 
the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
our success will depend on our ability to develop and apply our technologies in the design and development of our product candidates and to establish and maintain a market for our product candidates 
there also are many companies  both public and private  including major pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions engaged in developing pharmaceutical and biotechnology products 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  technical  research and development  and human resources than us 
competitors may develop products or other technologies that are more effective than any that are being developed by us or may obtain fda approval for products more rapidly than us 
if we commence commercial sales of products  we still must compete in the manufacturing and marketing of such products  areas in which we have no experience 
many of these companies also have manufacturing facilities and established marketing capabilities that would enable such companies to market competing products through existing channels of distribution 
two companies with similar profiles are vaxgen  inc  which is developing vaccines against anthrax  smallpox and hiv aids  and avant immunotherapeutics  inc  which has vaccine programs for agents of biological warfare 
because we must obtain regulatory clearance to test and market our products in the united states  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products 
a pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the us until it has completed rigorous pre clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the fda 
pharmaceutical products typically take many years to satisfy regulatory requirements and require the expenditure of substantial resources depending on the type  complexity and novelty of the product 
before commencing clinical trials in humans  we must submit and receive clearance from the fda by means of an investigational new drug ind application 
institutional review boards and the fda oversee clinical trials and such trials o must be conducted in conformance with the fda s good laboratory practice regulations  o must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight  o must meet requirements for informed consent  o must meet requirements for good clinical and manufacturing practices  o are subject to continuing fda oversight  o may require large numbers of test subjects  and o may be suspended by us or the fda at any time if it is believed that the subjects participating in these trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or if the fda finds deficiencies in the ind application or the conduct of these trials 
before receiving fda clearance to market a product  we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective on the patient population that will be treated 
data we obtain from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearances 
additionally  we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials and manufacturing processes necessary to obtain regulatory clearance 
if regulatory clearance of a product is granted  this clearance will be limited only to those states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and efficacious 
we cannot ensure that any compound developed by us  alone or with others  will prove to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing clearance 
if our technologies or those of our collaborators are alleged or found to infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others  we may be sued or have to license those rights from others on unfavorable terms 
our commercial success will depend significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
our technologies  along with our licensors and our collaborators technologies  may infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
if there is an adverse outcome in litigation or an interference to determine priority or other proceeding in a court or patent office  then we  or our collaborators and licensors  could be subjected to significant liabilities  required to license disputed rights from or to other parties and or required to cease using a technology necessary to carry out research  development and commercialization 
at present we are unaware of any or potential infringement claims against our patent portfolio 
the costs to establish the validity of patents  to defend against patent infringement claims of others and to assert infringement claims against others can be expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable 
an outcome of any patent prosecution or litigation that is unfavorable to us or one of our licensors or collaborators may have a material adverse effect on us 
we could incur substantial costs if we are required to defend ourselves in patent suits brought by third parties  if we participate in patent suits brought against or initiated by our licensors or collaborators or if we initiate such suits 
we may not have sufficient funds or resources in the event of litigation 
additionally  we may not prevail in any such action 
any conflicts resulting from third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned  optioned by or licensed to us or our collaborators and limit our ability or that of our collaborators to obtain meaningful patent protection 
if patents are issued to third parties that contain competitive or conflicting claims  we  our licensors or our collaborators may be legally prohibited from researching  developing or commercializing of potential products or be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
we  our licensors and or our collaborators may be legally prohibited from using patented technology  may not be able to obtain any license to the patents and technologies of third parties on acceptable terms  if at all  or may not be able to obtain or develop alternative technologies 
in addition  like many biopharmaceutical companies  we may from time to time hire scientific personnel formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities conducted by us 
we and or these individuals may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of their prior affiliations 
our ability to compete may decrease if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
our commercial success will depend in part on our and our collaborators ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our proprietary technologies  drug targets and potential products and to effectively preserve our trade secrets 
because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing potential products through the development and regulatory clearance processes to reach the marketplace  the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date 
accordingly  we cannot predict the type and breadth of claims allowed in these patents 
we have licensed the rights to eight issued us patents and three issued european patents 
these patents have varying lives and they are related to the technology licensed from rockefeller university for the strep and gram positive products 
we have one additional patent application in the us and one application in europe relating to this technology 
we are joint owner with washington university of seven issued patents in the us and one in europe 
in addition  there are four co owned us patent applications 
these patents are for the technology used for the gram negative product opportunities 
we are also exclusive owner of one us patent and three us patent applications 
one of these us patent applications relates to our degp product opportunities 
we included a summary of out patent positions as of december  in part i  item of this document 
we also rely on copyright protection  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities 
in an effort to maintain the confidentiality and ownership of trade secrets and proprietary information  we require our employees  consultants and some collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of a relationship with us 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  confidential information or inventions in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information  and adequate remedies may not exist in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 
we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we expect to experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
our ability to manage this growth will depend upon our ability to broaden our management team and our ability to attract  hire and retain skilled employees 
our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems and to hire  train and manage our employees 
our activities involve hazardous materials and may subject us to environmental regulatory liabilities 
our biopharmaceutical research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for damages  and this liability could exceed our resources 
the research and development activities of our company do not produce any unusual hazardous products 
we do use small amounts of p  s and h  which are stored  used and disposed of in accordance with nuclear regulatory commission nrc regulations 
we maintain liability insurance in the amount of approximately  and we believe this should be sufficient to cover any contingent losses 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations and currently do not expect to make material additional capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the near term 
however  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations 
our potential products may not be acceptable in the market or eligible for third party reimbursement resulting in a negative impact on our future financial results 
any products successfully developed by us or our collaborative partners may not achieve market acceptance 
the antibiotic products which we are attempting to develop will compete with a number of well established traditional antibiotic drugs manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors  including o the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of such products  o the potential advantage of such products over existing treatment methods  and o reimbursement policies of government and third party payors 
physicians  patients or the medical community in general may not accept or utilize any products that we or our collaborative partners may develop 
our ability to receive revenues and income with respect to drugs  if any  developed through the use of our technology will depend  in part  upon the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such drugs will be available from third party payors  such as government health administration authorities  private health care insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefits management companies and other organizations 
third party payors are increasingly disputing the prices charged for pharmaceutical products 
if third party reimbursement was not available or sufficient to allow profitable price levels to be maintained for drugs developed by us or our collaborative partners  it could adversely affect our business 
if our products harm people  we may experience product liability claims that may not be covered by insurance 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to potential product liability claims in the event that drugs we develop are alleged to cause adverse effects on patients 
such risk exists for products being tested in human clinical trials  as well as products that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
we may seek to obtain product liability insurance with respect to drugs we and or or our collaborative partners develop 
however  we may not be able to obtain such insurance 
even if such insurance is obtainable  it may not be available at a reasonable cost or in a sufficient amount to protect us against liability 
we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market  which could harm sales of the affected products 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products  if any  after they are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur o regulatory approval may be withdrawn  o reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products may be required  o changes to or re approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required  o sales of the affected products may drop significantly  o our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and o lawsuits  including class action suits  may be brought against us 
any of the above occurrences could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing these products 
the manufacture of genetically engineered commensals is a time consuming and complex process which may delay or prevent commercialization of our products  or may prevent our ability to produce an adequate volume for the successful commercialization of our products 
although our management believes that we have the ability to acquire or produce quantities of genetically engineered commensals sufficient to support our present needs for research and our projected needs for our initial clinical development programs  management believes that improvements in our manufacturing technology will be required to enable us to meet the volume and cost requirements needed for certain commercial applications of commensal products 
products based on commensals have never been manufactured on a commercial scale 
the manufacture of all of our products will be subject to current gmp requirements prescribed by the fda or other standards prescribed by the appropriate regulatory agency in the country of use 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manufacture products  or have products manufactured for us  in a timely fashion at acceptable quality and prices  that we or third party manufacturers can comply with gmp  or that we or third party manufacturers will be able to manufacture an adequate supply of product 
healthcare reform and controls on healthcare spending may limit the price we charge for any products and the amounts thereof that we can sell 
the us federal government and private insurers have considered ways to change  and have changed  the manner in which healthcare services are provided in the us potential approaches and changes in recent years include controls on healthcare spending and the creation of large purchasing groups 
in the future  the us government may institute further controls and limits on medicare and medicaid spending 
these controls and limits might affect the payments we could collect from sales of any products 
uncertainties regarding future healthcare reform and private market practices could adversely affect our ability to sell any products profitably in the us at present  we do not foresee any changes in fda regulatory policies that would adversely affect our development programs 
the future issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the voting powers  designations  preferences  rights and qualifications  limitations or restrictions of these shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and could be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
concentration of ownership of our capital stock could delay or prevent change of control 
our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders beneficially own a significant percentage of our common stock and preferred stock 
they also have  through the exercise or conversion of certain securities  the right to acquire additional common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if acting together  have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval 
additionally  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of siga 
at december   directors  officers and principal stockholders beneficially owned approximately of our stock
