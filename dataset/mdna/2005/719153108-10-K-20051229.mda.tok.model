item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth below under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
company overview phoenix technologies is a global leader in the development  design  and support of software products that define  identify  and restore digital devices based on the x 
microprocessor architecture 
these devices include  but are not limited to  personal computers pcs  servers and embedded machines 
in addition to key products  we also provide support services to our customers as required  such as training  maintenance  and engineering services 
the majority of the company s revenue comes from core system software css  the evolution of bios basic input output system  for pcs  servers and embedded devices  where phoenix has established global market share leadership 
css customers are usually original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms  who build in phoenix firmware products at the manufacturing stage 
the company also provides software applications products that restore a device s contents  enable device identification to a network  and provide instant on access to certain frequently used applications 
end customers for these applications products are enterprises  governments and service providers 
fiscal overview phoenix analyzes revenue along two dimensions a platform  with pcs and servers representing one category and non pc devices  including consumer and industrial devices  representing a second category  and b products  with core system software representing one category and applications representing the second 
table of contents category 
we disclose revenue breakdowns in three resulting sectors pc server core system software  pc server applications  and non pc devices including both css and applications which will be discussed in more detail under results of operations and revenues 
the pc server core system software sector is currently our largest  representing of our total revenues in fiscal  compared to of our total revenues in fiscal revenue in this sector in fiscal increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we believe that our pc server core system software business is tracking well to pricing and growth trends in the overall pc industry  and that our overall market share continues to strengthen 
revenue in the pc server applications sector increased significantly from million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues  to million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues 
revenue in the non pc device sector decreased from million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues  to million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues 
this result was less than our internal expectations because we were less effective than we hoped to be at building sales and distribution channels for our products in non pc devices  and at delivering additional product features relevant to this sector 
the company continues to make efforts to develop and implement its strategic plan to improve its business outlook and profitability 
we are expanding our partnerships with key system builders and channel partners  as well as with their top customers  to establish brand awareness of our products and ultimately to generate increased demand 
we also continue to re align resources geographically to better serve our customers  including refocusing field support to speed up customer adoptions in the applications businesses  and maintaining disciplines on discretionary spending 
operating expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the addition of sales and marketing headcount to support our products  increased investments in demand creation and channel building activities across all regions  and investments in financial controls and systems 
during fiscal  we continued to enter into two types of transactions under which our odm and oem customers make larger and longer term financial commitments volume purchase agreements vpas and paid up license agreements 
under vpas  customers commit to a fixed payment schedule for an agreed upon number of units  typically for anticipated consumption over the next several quarters 
amounts that have been invoiced under vpas and relate to amounts not recognized as of the end of the quarter are recorded as deferred revenues 
our total deferred revenue decreased from million at september  to million at september  the decrease was primarily due to the shift toward paid up license arrangements 
during fiscal  we entered into an increased number of paid up license arrangements  under which our customers pay a fixed upfront fee for an unlimited number of units 
under these arrangements  we recognize all license revenues upon execution of the agreement 
in all cases these paid up arrangements have restrictions  with respect either to specific phoenix products  or to specific devices sold by our customers  or to both 
our revenues from such paid up license arrangements increased from million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues  to million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues 
we plan to continue to enter into vpas and paid up license arrangements with our key customers  we believe that these deals stabilize our product pricing  block out our competitors and enable the relationship to focus on newer products and technology 
paid up licenses also offer our customers the pricing flexibility that they require for their business needs  and enable them to install our products economically into devices and device designs that had not previously made use of our products 
the relative number and dollar amount of vpas  compared to paid up licenses  will vary significantly from time to time  depending on a number of factors such as competition  customer preferences  and technology trends 
the most significant factor is often where a product is in its lifecycle a key factor in how prices are determined for paid up licenses is an estimate of the number of units likely to be covered under the arrangement  and this estimate has less uncertainty to both phoenix and our customers when we both have had significant volume experience already  and when the remaining shipment horizon is shorter 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the company has discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including non recurring engineering efforts  maintenance consisting of product support services and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis  and training 
in many cases  and in all cases with respect to our core system software  our products are incorporated into the products of our oem odm customers 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
the company uses the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element 
vsoe of fair value is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately or  for items not yet being sold  it is the price established by management that will not change before the introduction of the item into the marketplace 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element s is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenues 
if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  revenues are deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we are required to exercise judgement in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
revenue from arrangements including rights to unspecified future products is recognized ratably over the term of the respective agreement 
the company recognizes revenue related to the delivered products or services only if the above revenue recognition criteria are met  any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  and payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services royalty revenues from oems odms are generally recognized in each period based on estimated consumption by the oems odms of products containing our software  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we normally recognize revenue for all consumption prior to the end of the accounting period 
however  for volume purchase agreements vpas we also recognize revenues for units estimated to be consumed by the end of the following accounting quarter  to the extent that the customer has been billed for such consumption prior to the end of the quarter and provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
since we generally receive quarterly royalty reports from our oems odms approximately to days following the end of the quarter  we have put processes in place to reasonably estimate the royalty revenues  including obtaining estimates of production from our oem odm customers  utilizing historical experience  and using other relevant current information 
based on our estimates of earned but unreported royalties  we recognized million and million of royalty revenues from our oem odm customers during the years ended september  and september   respectively 
to date  the variances between estimated and actual revenues have been immaterial 
although management believes that it has a reliable basis for making reasonable estimates  the actual results could differ depending on customer or market factors 
amounts that have been invoiced under vpas and relate to anticipated consumption beyond the following accounting quarter that we have determined to be not fixed or determinable are recorded as deferred revenues 
during an accounting period  deferred revenues increase or decrease primarily to the extent that the dollar amount of new vpas entered into during the period is greater or less than the revenue that is recognized during the period from those agreements and the outstanding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period 
we believe virtually all deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue within the next months 

table of contents from time to time we enter into oem contracts under which we receive undifferentiated license fees that cover both pc server core system software and pc server applications 
in order to allocate the undifferentiated license fees between core system software and applications  we estimate the percentage of the undifferentiated license fee that would have applied to each product had the contract differentiated between the license fee for core system software and the license fee for applications for purposes of discussing our revenue categories 
this allocation has no impact on the timing or amount of our total revenue recognition in any period 
our estimation methodology involves examining various factors  such as the average sale prices for core system software and for applications in a broad range of large transactions  the time period over which the average selling prices are calculated  and the specific products involved 
this estimation methodology requires significant management judgment 
as new transactions occur  we anticipate that our estimation methodology will continue to reflect management s current assessment of factors that it deems relevant to making an appropriate estimate 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we discovered that we had previously allocated undifferentiated license fees under certain contracts with an oem customer for products installed on notebook computers but not for products installed on desktop computers 
desktop related revenues under these contracts had all been reported as core system software revenue 
as a result  we reallocated certain pc related revenues  for the four quarters from the third quarter of fiscal through the second quarter of fiscal  from core system software to applications 
the impact was a shift of approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  in these quarters from core system software revenue to applications revenue 
total revenues  net income and cash flows from operations were not affected by this reallocation 
in addition  we may execute multiple contracts amendments with the same customer several times throughout a year 
these contracts are reviewed to determine if they are linked and should be evaluated as one deal 
the review includes consideration of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop and technical practice aid  software revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements tpa guidelines and the standard historical business practice of our company 
allowance for sales and doubtful accounts 
we record provisions for estimated sales allowances against revenues in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
at september  and  the allowance for sales and doubtful accounts was million and million respectively 
these estimates are based on our assessment of the probable collection from specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable  historical royalty revenue variances  analysis of credit memo data  bad debt write offs  and other known factors 
if economic or specific industry trends worsen beyond our estimates  or if there is a deterioration of our major customers credit worthiness  or actual defaults are higher than our estimates based on historical experience  we would increase the allowances for sales and doubtful accounts which would impact revenue and expense  respectively  as appropriate 
intangible assets 
intangible assets include prepaid royalties  purchased technologies  goodwill and other intangibles 
at september  and september   these assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million  respectively 
prepaid royalties represent payments to several third party technology partners for their software that is incorporated into certain of our products 
all other intangible assets were derived from our acquisitions 
the cost of the acquisitions is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair value at the date of acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
the useful life of the intangible assets was estimated based on the period over which the assets were expected to contribute directly and indirectly to the future cash flows 
if assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
accordingly  the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the original recorded values of intangible assets and goodwill are based on third 
table of contents party appraisals 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement for the acquisition of integrity science  inc isi in february  contingent consideration of million is to be paid out in equal annual increments beginning in fiscal providing that the developed technology purchased as part of the original business combination is still utilized within products at the annual milestone dates 
in june  the company made the first payment of million in accordance with the earn out terms noted above  and recorded the payment as additional purchase price resulting in incremental goodwill 
in may  the company completed the second payment of million  which was accrued for in march in accordance with the earn out terms 
income taxes 
estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes assets and valuation allowance when preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and assess temporary differences due to different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes thereby resulting in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform an assessment of the recoverability of the deferred income tax assets  which is principally dependent upon our ability to achieve taxable income in specific geographies 
after examining the available evidence at september   we believe a full valuation allowance was necessary for the us federal and state net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas  which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence such as operating results during recent periods is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
despite recent profitable results our past financial performance represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our us federal and state deferred tax assets under sfas we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the us federal and state deferred tax assets

revenues by geographic region based on country of sale for fiscal years   and were as follows in thousands amount of revenues change of revenues north america japan taiwan other asian countries europe total revenues total revenues in fiscal increased by compared with fiscal revenues for fiscal from japan decreased by  while revenues from taiwan  other asian countries  north america  and europe increased by    and respectively  from fiscal the decrease in japan was primarily due to the continued migration of system manufacturing from oems to odms primarily based in other asian countries that generally ship in higher volumes and at lower unit prices 
the increase in revenue in taiwan  other asian countries  north america  and europe was primarily due to increased unit shipments as a result of general industry expansion as well as greater market share in the core system software sector  and a number of large paid up license arrangements that we entered into in fiscal year  under which all revenues were recognized up front 

table of contents total revenues in fiscal increased by compared with fiscal revenues for fiscal from other asian countries and north america decreased by and  respectively  while revenues from japan  taiwan and europe increased by  and  respectively  from fiscal the decrease in north america and other asian countries was primarily due to the migration from oems to odms  which generally have higher volumes and lower unit prices 
the increase in japan  taiwan  and europe was primarily due to a number of large paid up license arrangements that we entered into in taiwan and europe in fiscal year where all revenues were recognized up front and increased unit shipments as a result of a strengthening economy in some of these regions in fiscal the following table represents revenue by sector for fiscal  and in thousands years ended september  of revenues pc server core system software pc server applications non pc core system software and applications total pc server core system software revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal revenue in this sector was attributable to multiple factors including increased unit shipments as a result of a modest increase in overall pc industry unit volume and a continuing shift in pc demand from desktops to notebooks  for which our unit price is higher  partially offset by continuing downward pressure on the prices of all components of pcs  which has been a long term trend 
revenues in this sector also benefited from an increased number of large paid up license arrangements in fiscal  as revenues related to such paid up arrangements increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pc server core system software revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal revenue was primarily due to the continued migration of pc server manufacturing from our oem customers to our larger odm customers  resulting in lower overall average unit prices 
this trend was partially offset by an increase in pc units shipped across the entire pc market and a shift in pc market share from desktop pcs to notebook pcs  for which we receive a higher unit price 
revenues in this sector also benefited from an increased number of large paid up license arrangements in fiscal  as revenues related to such paid up arrangements increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pc server applications revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal revenues from paid up license arrangements in this revenue sector increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal however  the majority of this amount in fiscal came from transactions with oems where the principal focus of the paid up license was core system software  in such cases we allocate revenues between core system software and applications as discussed above under critical accounting policies and estimates 
a number of our applications products  including recover pro  trustconnector  and firstware assistant  were introduced in their current architecture in mid to late fiscal  and consequently did not contribute significantly to revenues until fiscal also  the company continued to make progress in increasing the range of our applications products available in the market through significant investments in new reseller  distribution  and system builder channels 
as sales into designs originating from these channels tend to follow a much longer life cycle  we believe that the growth in total applications revenues demonstrates our success in securing new system designs and strengthening our relationships with our customers as they roll out their products 
pc server applications revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the principal contributors to this revenue increase were a wider array of applications products available in the market and increased sales through our new distribution  reseller and system builder channels 

table of contents the last revenue sector is non pc devices  which includes both core system software and applications 
revenues in the non pc device sector decreased slightly  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues from paid up license arrangements in this revenue sector decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the overall million result was less than our internal expectations because we were less effective than we hoped to be at building sales and distribution channels for our products in non pc devices  and at delivering additional product features relevant to this sector 
even so  we have successfully secured new designs in many critical new markets such as set top boxes  gaming  and atm terminals  and in future periods  we expect continued long term growth in this sector as more and more device builders and vendors adopt x 
based technology for their non pc devices 
the non pc device sector recorded a significant increase in revenue to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we believe there is less revenue stability here because this sector includes a high proportion of non standard contracts  including paid up license arrangements  for which revenue is recognized upon contract execution 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of revenues consists of third party license fees  engineering service costs and amortization of purchased technology 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues were   and for fiscal year   and gross profit was million for fiscal year as compared to million for the same period in fiscal the increase in dollar amount was related to higher revenues  however increased investment in our post sales customer support teams resulted in a slight decrease in gross margin 
gross margin was million for fiscal year as compared to million for the same period in fiscal the increase in dollar amount was mainly related to higher revenues and the increase in percentage was related to improved efficiencies in our post sales customer support group 
amortization of purchased technologies from business combinations was million for each of fiscal year   and  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses represented   and in fiscals   and  respectively 
the decrease in expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower payroll and related expenses  as a result of the shift in research and development activity to lower cost manufacturing centers in china and india throughout fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower payroll and related expenses  as a result of the restructuring programs implemented in fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses represented   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in dollar amount in was primarily driven by higher payroll and related compensation expenses and increased investment in sales and marketing programs  as a result of increasing our sales and marketing headcount across all regions and enhancing our distribution and reseller channel building efforts 
the decrease in dollar amount from to was due primarily to lower payroll and related compensation expenses as a result of the fiscal restructuring program and tighter spending controls on marketing activities  partially offset by an increase in discretionary sales related expenses as a result of our enhanced channel building efforts and an increase in marketing program expenses related to increased product launches 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses represented   and 
table of contents in fiscal   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses  excluding professional services and other expenses in related to sarbanes oxley compliance  remained relatively constant from fiscal to fiscal stock based compensation the stock based compensation expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
charges in fiscal   and were primarily due to the amortization of options granted to purchase stock at exercise prices less than the fair market value on the measurement date which will be discussed in more detail under new accounting pronouncements 
restructuring costs restructuring charges credits during fiscal   and  were nil  million  and million  respectively 
fiscal restructuring programs during fiscal  we implemented three restructuring programs in the first quarter of fiscal  the company announced a restructuring program that affected approximately positions across all business functions and closed its facilities in irvine  california and louisville  colorado 
this restructuring resulted in employee termination benefit charges of million  estimated facilities exit expenses of million  and asset write offs in the amount of million 
all charges were recorded in the three months ended december  in accordance with emerging issues task force liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity eitf 
as of september   payments relating to the employee termination benefits were completed 
actual payments for employee termination benefits were lower than the original provision as of september  as a result  million of excess accrual was reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company increased the restructuring liability related to the irvine  california facility by million  million  and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the second quarter of fiscal  and the third quarter of fiscal  respectively  to reflect changes in the assumptions made previously for both the length of time the space would remain vacant and the sublease rate when the company finds subtenants 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company decreased the restructuring liability related to the irvine  california facility by million  to reflect sublease activity 
the unpaid portion of million for facilities exit expenses are included under the captions accrued restructuring charges current and accrued restructuring charges noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets 
in the second quarter of fiscal  phoenix continued its effort in aligning global engineering resources 
approximately positions across multiple business functions  primarily in research and development  were affected by this effort 
this resulted in an employee termination benefit charge of million 
this charge is recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
all terminations were completed as of march  no future services will be rendered under the previous employee agreements 
actual payments for employee termination benefits were lower than the original provision as of september  as a result  million of excess accrual was reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal payments were completed as of september  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company furthered its restructuring program to align global engineering resources and streamline finance operations 
approximately positions across business functions  primarily in research and development and finance  were affected by this program 
this resulted in an employee termination benefit charge of million  which is recorded in accordance with sfas actual payments for 
table of contents employee termination benefits were lower than the original provision as of march  as a result  million of excess accrual was reversed in the second quarter of fiscal as of june  all payments related to this plan were paid in full 
as a result of the fiscal restructuring programs  we estimate pretax savings in operating expenses to be million on an annualized basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details on our restructuring plans implemented in fiscal fiscal restructuring program in october  the company announced a restructuring program that identified and eliminated approximately positions across all business functions from its global workforce  including several senior management positions 
this restructuring program was to reduce our on going operating expense level 
this reduction resulted in a net charge of million  comprised of million of severance charges in the first quarter of fiscal and million credit to adjust excess accruals in the fourth quarter of fiscal payments were completed as of september  final actual payments for employee termination benefits were lower than the original provision 
as a result  million of excess accrual was reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest and other income  net net interest and other income was millions  million  and nil in fiscal years   and  respectively 
net interest and other income consists mostly of interest income  which is primarily derived from cash and short term investments  foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and losses on disposal of assets 
the interest income generated each period is highly dependent on available cash and fluctuations in government interest rates 
the average interest rate earned was approximately   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
all of the cash equivalents and short term investments are in us dollars and are not subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in fiscal  we invested mostly in highly liquid short term taxable auction instruments and corporate notes 
interest income was million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
loss on disposal of assets was nil  million  and nil  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the loss in fiscal year was mainly related to assets written off from the relocation of our headquarters and closure of offices as part of the restructuring programs 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million  million  and million reflecting effective tax rates of   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was significantly different from the expected tax benefit derived by applying the us federal statutory rate to the income before taxes primarily due to foreign income taxes  withholding taxes assessed by foreign tax jurisdictions  and an addition of million to a reserve established for a transfer pricing exposure related to intercompany charges between the company s hong kong subsidiary and its branch operations in taiwan 
this transfer pricing exposure arose in the quarter ended september  with notice of the taiwan tax authorities intent to assess a million deficiency for the fiscal year ended the company has reviewed the pending assessment and determined that for all of the open years affected by the current transfer pricing policy  an exposure of million exists  which as of september  has been fully reserved 

table of contents the company believes that the taiwan tax authorities interpretation of the governing law is inappropriate and plans to contest this assessment  however given the current political and economic climate within the republic of taiwan  there can be no reasonable assurance as to the ultimate outcome 
the company  however  believes that the reserves established for this exposure are adequate under the present circumstances 
after examining the available evidence at september   we believe that a valuation allowance of million against our net us federal and state net deferred tax assets was necessary due to our operating results in recent periods 
the effective tax rate in was significantly different from the expected tax benefit derived by applying the us federal statutory rate to the income before taxes primarily due to foreign income and withholding taxes assessed by foreign tax jurisdictions

table of contents in october  the board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of phoenix s common stock over a twelve month period 
during fiscal  the company repurchased approximately  shares of its common stock at a cost of million 
during fiscal years and  the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock 
commitments we have commitments under non cancelable operating leases ranging from one to ten years for million 
the operating lease obligations include a net lease commitment for the irvine  california location of million  after sublease income of million 
the irvine net lease commitment was included in the company s fiscal first quarter restructuring plan 
see note for further information on the company s restructuring plans

the new standard will be effective for public entities in the first fiscal year beginning after june  the company is required to adopt statement r in its quarter ending december  and is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting this new standard 
risk factors the additional following factors should be considered carefully when evaluating our business 
fluctuations in operating results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of our license fees are subject to a number of factors that make estimating revenues and operating results prior to the end of a quarter uncertain 
while we receive recurring revenues from royalty based license agreements and some agreements contain minimum quarterly royalty commitments  a significant amount of license fees in any quarter is dependent on signing agreements and delivering the licensed software in that quarter 
generally  we experience a pattern of recording or more of our quarterly revenues in the third month of the quarter 
we have historically monitored our revenue bookings through regular  periodic worldwide forecast reviews within the quarter 
there can be no assurances that this process will result in our meeting revenue expectations 
our planned operating expenses for any year are normally based on the attainment of planned revenue levels for that year and are generally incurred ratably throughout the year 
as a result  if revenues were less than planned in any period while expense levels remain relatively fixed our operating results would be adversely affected for that period 
in addition  unplanned expenses could adversely affect operating results for the period in which such expenses were incurred 
product development our long term success will depend on our ability to enhance existing products and to introduce new products timely and cost effectively that meet the needs of customers in existing and emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new products or in enhancing existing products or that those new and or enhanced products will be introduced before our competitors make their introductions  or that those products will meet market requirements 
delays in introducing new products can adversely impact acceptance and revenues generated from the sale of such products 
we have  from time to time  experienced such delays 
our software products and their enhancements contain complex code that may contain undetected errors and or bugs when first introduced 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will not contain errors or bugs that will adversely affect commercial acceptance of such new products or enhancements 
the introduction of new products in the short term will also depend on adoption of our phoenix cme and applications as well as the overall market demand for pcs and other digital devices 
uncertain geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and market conditions adverse economic conditions in certain geographic regions have contributed to recent slowdowns in the pc and information appliance industries and could continue to impact our business  resulting in reduced demand for our products as a result of a decrease in capital spending by our customers  changes in customer production strategies  increased price competition for our products  partially as a consequence of a high growth of the pc market in underdeveloped nations  where the price target is below for a desktop  and higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 

table of contents recent political turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
if the global economic and market conditions do not improve  or if they deteriorate further  we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 
changes in industry and market conditions in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses 
any decision to limit investment in  or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges  such as technology related write offs  workforce reduction costs  or charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities 
our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets  including purchased intangible assets  could change as a result of such assessments and decisions 
further  our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions 
additionally  we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
end user demand for device security and availability many of our current products and product features  such as recover  recover pro  trustconnector  and the security related features in trustedcore  are focused on helping to ensure that pcs and other digital devices are secure and available to the users  with a minimum of user skill required for end users to take advantage of these capabilities 
the success of our strategy depends on continued growth in end user demand for these capabilities 
although factors such as global terrorism  increased instances of malware  and increased end user reliance on their digital devices have all contributed to significant growth in demand for security related products over the last several years  it is difficult to predict whether these trends will continue  accelerate  or decelerate 
variations in demand for secure and available digital devices below our expectations could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
demand for microsoft s vista operating system and for newer microprocessor designs the adoption of new primary pc technology  related specifically to operating systems and to microprocessor designs  may have a significant impact on the relative demand for our different core system software products 
in particular  microsoft s new vista operating system  formerly codenamed longhorn  is designed to support security capabilities that will operate more effectively on pcs running trustedcore than on those running older versions of our css 
similarly  some newer microprocessor designs offered by the silicon chip vendors may require the functionality provided by trustedcore to take full advantage of the new designs enhancements 
for example  trustedcore is designed to be easily adaptable for the newer generation of multiple core microprocessors offered by intel and amd  including intel s dual core processor codenamed napa while older versions of our core system software will require more customization effort by our customers 
as a result  the demand for trustedcore could vary in proportion to the rate at which vista and these newer microprocessor designs are adopted 
such variations would not necessarily lead to changes in our market share for css  however  because we have entered into a significantly larger number of paid up license arrangements  under which our customers pay a fixed upfront fee for an unlimited number of units  for our legacy css products than for trustedcore  our future reported revenues could be affected to the extent that revenues related to legacy css products may already have been recognized 

table of contents market for device designs based on the x 
microprocessor architecture virtually all of our core system software products have been designed for devices running microprocessors that are variants of the x 
microprocessor architecture 
this is not a limitation in the pc marketplace  where almost all products use x 
cpus  but the x 
share for most other devices  including servers  embedded industrial devices  and consumer electronics devices  is significantly less 
we believe that the market for non pc devices running on x 
microprocessors is growing faster than the market for pcs  and the share of non pc devices using x 
microprocessors is increasing  in large part because we believe that x 
based designs can be brought to market more quickly and efficiently  and at lower cost than designs based on other microprocessor architectures 
however  the microprocessor design decision for manufacturers and vendors of digital devices is extremely complicated for a variety of reasons  including  but not limited to  cost  power consumption  heat generation  size  and the availability of engineering resources 
there can be no assurance that trends regarding the type of microprocessor driving digital devices will continue as they have in the past  or that manufacturers and vendors of devices based on the x 
architecture will use our core system software 
dependence on new product releases by our customers successful introduction of new products is key to our success in both our css and new applications businesses 
frequently our new products are used in our customers new products  making each of us dependent on the other for product introduction schedules 
it can happen that a customer may not be able to introduce one of its new products for reasons unrelated to our new product 
in these cases  we would not be able to ship our new product until the customer had resolved its other problems 
due to continued economic downturn and market uncertainties in certain geographic regions  customers may delay their product introductions 
if our customers delay their product introductions  our ability to generate revenue from our new application products would be adversely affected 
risks in acquisitions our growth is dependent upon market growth  our ability to enhance our existing products and introduction of new products on a timely basis 
we have addressed and will continue to address the need to introduce new products through acquisitions of other companies and technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in process research and development  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  assume liabilities  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  
table of contents incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  incur large and immediate write offs of in process research and development costs  or become subject to litigation 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way 
even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 
we have not made acquisitions that result in in process research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter 
these charges may occur in future acquisitions in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings 
litigation from time to time  we become involved in litigation claims and disputes in the ordinary course of business 
we are currently involved in several lawsuits 
litigation can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
protection of intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  trademark  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our software products 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in addition  copyright and trade secret protection for our products may be unavailable or unreliable in certain foreign countries 
as of september   we have been issued patents in the us and had patent applications in process in the united states patent and trademark office 
on a worldwide basis  we have been issued patents with respect to our product offerings and have patent applications pending with respect to certain of the products we market 
we maintain an active internal program designed to identify employee inventions worthy of being patented 
there can be no assurance that any of the pending applications will be approved and patents issued or that our engineers will be able to develop technologies capable of being patented 
also  as the number of software patents increases  we believe that companies that develop software products may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that a third party will not assert that their patents or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by us 
any such claims  whether or not meritorious  may be time consuming and expensive to defend  can trigger indemnity obligations owed by us to third parties and may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
infringement of valid patents or copyrights or misappropriation of valid trade secrets  whether alleged against us  or our customers  and regardless of whether such claims have merit  could also have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
effective tax rates our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have varying statutory rates or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 

table of contents entrance into new or developing markets as we focus on new market opportunities  we will increasingly compete with large  established suppliers as well as start up companies 
some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources  including technical and engineering resources  than we have 
additionally  as customers in these markets mature and expand  they may require greater levels of service and support than we have provided in the past 
we expect that demand for these types of services and support may increase in the future 
finally  our efforts to sell pc applications  and to sell core system software as well as applications for non pc devices  require us to sell into markets  or to players in those markets  where we do not have significant prior experience 
many of our competitors may have an advantage over us because of their larger presence and deeper experience in these markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and market products  services  and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 
further  provision of greater levels of services may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition 
changes in financial accounting standards we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standard board  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  the sec and various bodies appointed by these organizations to interpret existing rules and create new accounting policies 
accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition  in particular  have been the subject of frequent interpretations  which have had a profound effect on the way we license our products 
as a result of the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act in and the related scrutiny of accounting policies by the sec and the various national and international accounting industry bodies  we expect the frequency of accounting policy changes to accelerate 
future changes in financial accounting standards  including pronouncements relating to revenue recognition  may have a significant effect on our reported results 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r requires us to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the adoption of sfas r will require additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas r is effective for us as of october  and will apply to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date as well as the unvested portion of prior awards 
the implementation by us will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
importance of microsoft and intel for a number of years  we have worked closely with leading software and semiconductor companies  including microsoft and intel  in developing standards for the pc industry 
although we remain optimistic regarding relationships with these industry leaders  there can be no assurance that leading software and semiconductor companies will not develop alternative product strategies that could conflict with our product plans and marketing strategies 
action by such companies may adversely impact our business and results of operations 
presently  there is little overlap or conflict in our product offerings  although these companies may incorporate some functionality that has traditionally resided in css 
we must continuously create new features and functions to sustain  as well as increase  our software s added value to our customers 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts 
attraction and retention of key personnel our ability to achieve our revenue and operating performance objectives will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain top tier engineering  sales  marketing  and administrative personnel 
as we expand into new 
table of contents products and new markets we need to hire people with backgrounds different from our traditional css business 
accordingly  failure to attract and retain employees with the necessary skills could adversely affect our business and operating results 
all of our employees  including executive officers and key personnel  are employees at will 
dependence on key customers  concentration of credit the loss of any key customer and our inability to replace revenues provided by a key customer may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our customer base includes large oems in the pc  semiconductor and internet markets  system integrator value added resellers  and motherboard manufacturers 
as a result  we maintain individually significant receivable balances due from some of them 
if these customers fail to meet guaranteed minimum royalty payments and other payment obligations  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as of september   lenovo singapore pte 
ltd 
accounted for of our total accounts receivable 
there are no other customers with more than of our total accounts receivable 
competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive and we expect both product and pricing competition to increase 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced margins  or the failure of one or more of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any of which could adversely affect our business 
the company competes for css sales primarily with in house research and development r d departments of pc manufacturers that may have significantly greater financial and technical resources  as well as closer engineering ties and experience with specific hardware platforms  than the company 
major oem companies which may use their own internal bios r d personnel include dell computer corporation  hewlett packard company  ibm corporation workstation and server only  toshiba corporation  and intel corporation 
in addition  some of these competitors are also our customers 
any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 
the company also competes for system software business with other independent suppliers  including american megatrends inc  a privately held company  and other small bios companies 
in the applications software area  as with css  the company competes with in house and third party company solutions 
the company s applications that reside in the protected area of hard drives compete with individual component software and diagnostic and repair software from other companies  as well as with pc manufacturer developed solutions 
large enterprise solution competitors such as altiris incorporated and symantec corporation  as well as smaller third party companies are the primary players 
the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to provide products and services which meets the needs of out target customers  the functionality and performance of these products  price  the ability to introduce new products timely  and overall company size and perceived stability 

table of contents international sales and activities revenues derived from international sales comprise a majority of total revenues 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience significant fluctuations in international revenues 
while the major portion of our license fee or royalty contracts are us dollar denominated  we are entering into a number of contracts denominated in local currencies 
we have international sales and engineering offices in germany  the netherlands  japan  korea  taiwan  hong kong  china and india 
our operations and financial results may be adversely affected by factors associated with international operations  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  uncertainties related to regional economic circumstances  unexpected changes in local laws or regulations  political instability in emerging markets  difficulties in attracting qualified employees  and language  cultural and other difficulties managing foreign operations 
in addition  an increasing percentage of our labor force  particularly in engineering  is located in the people s republic of china and india 
although our objective is to ensure a supply of talented employees at lower expense than we incur in our other employee locations  there can be no assurances that a favorable market for employees will continue to exist  or that changes in local conditions  such as labor laws and regulations  will not adversely affect our results of operations 
prior to filing its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june   the company discovered that revenue relating to one software license transaction that was reported in the company s tokyo  japan office in the third quarter of fiscal could not be recognized due to irregularities associated with the execution of the contract 
upon discovery of the irregularities associated with this transaction  the company s audit committee immediately launched an investigation conducted by its general and outside counsel 
based upon the results of the investigation conducted  the company concluded that the transaction in question was an isolated event 
the company is conducting a review of its policies and processes to mitigate the chance of a recurrence 
however there can be no assurances that the company will not discover irregularities in the future 
volatile market for phoenix stock the market for our stock is highly volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and will continue to be  subject to fluctuations in response to operating and financial results  changes in demand for our products and services  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction and market acceptance of new technologies by us or our competitors  changes in our product mix or product direction or the product mix or direction of our competitors  pricing pressure from our customers and competitors  changes in our revenue mix and revenue growth rates  changes in expectations of growth for the pc industry or the x 
based non pc digital device industry  the overall trend toward industry consolidation both among our competitors and customers  the timing and size of orders from customers  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  as well as other events or factors which we may not be able to influence or control 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the markets in which we do business  companies with which we compete or relating to us specifically could have an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many small capitalization  high technology companies and have often included factors other than the operating performance of these companies 
if our market value decreases below our net book value  we may have to record a charge for impairment of goodwill 
certain anti takeover effects our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan and the delaware general corporation law include provisions that may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
these include provisions under which members of the board of directors are divided into three classes and are elected to serve staggered three year terms 

table of contents business disruptions while we have not been the target of software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our products  such viruses could be created and deployed against our products in the future 
similarly  experienced computer programmers or hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web sites from time to time 
a hacker who penetrates our network or web sites could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by virus creators and or hackers 
in addition  acts of war  power shortage  natural disasters  acts of terror  and regional and global health risks could impact our ability to conduct business in certain regions 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk we consider investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of less than three months at date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and total investments in thousands september  cash and cash equivalents short term investment total our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investments are in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
at any time  a sharp increase in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of investment securities held at september  and that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of september  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps auction instrument and corporate notes valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of september  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps auction instrument and corporate notes these instruments are not leveraged and are considered available for sale investments 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps 
a basis point is defined as one hundredth of a percentage point 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities will have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if there is a decline in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  or we may suffer a loss in principal if we are forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as stated above 
foreign currency risk international sales are primarily sourced in their respective countries and are mostly denominated in us dollars 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign 
table of contents subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the impact from a hypothetical percent appreciation depreciation of the us dollar from september  market rates would be immaterial on our net income
