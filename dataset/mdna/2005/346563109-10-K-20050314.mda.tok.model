item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we derive revenues from memberships to our research product offerings and from our advisory services and events available through what we refer to as research  data  consulting  and community offerings 
we offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
clients purchase advisory services offered through our data  consulting and community products and services to supplement their memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue when performed 
event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event 
consequently  changes in the number and value of client contracts  both net decreases as well as net increases  impact our revenues and other results over a period of several months 
our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization and amortization of intangible assets 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  and it includes the costs of salaries  bonuses  and related benefits for research personnel and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  employee benefits  travel expenses  promotional costs  sales commissions  and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and strategy groups and our other administrative functions 
overhead costs are allocated over these categories according to the number of employees in each group 
amortization of intangible assets represents the cost of amortizing acquired intangible assets such as customer base  research content and trademarks 
in february  we acquired giga information group  inc giga  a global technology advisory firm  pursuant to a cash tender offer and second step merger 
the results of giga s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since february  as part of the acquisition of giga  we acquired an equity investment in gigagroup sa gigagroup 
gigagroup was created in through the spin off of giga s french subsidiary  and held an exclusive agreement to distribute all giga research and certain services in france  belgium  netherlands  luxemburg  switzerland  italy  spain  and portugal 
in november  we acquired the assets of gigagroup 
the results of gigagroup s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since november  agreement value  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business 
we believe that the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services provides a significant measure of our business volume 
we calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  we calculate client retention as the number of client companies who renewed with memberships as a percentage of those that would have expired 
we calculate dollar retention as a percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve month fiscal period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period 
we calculate enrichment as a percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts 
client retention  dollar retention  and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
a summary of our key metrics is as follows year ended december  absolute percentage increase increase agreement value in millions client retention dollar retention enrichment year ended december  absolute percentage increase increase agreement value in millions client retention dollar retention enrichment the increase in agreement value from to is primarily due to increases in average contract sizes and in the number of clients 
the average contract for annual memberships for research only at december  was approximately  an increase of from  at december  the average contract for an annual membership for research which also included advisory services at december  was approximately  an increase of from  at december  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment increases in and reflect an improving economic environment 
the increase in agreement value  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment from to is primarily attributable to the acquisition of giga  and to a lesser extent  the acquisition of gigagroup 
reorganizations since july  we have reorganized our workforce and consolidated our facilities several times in response to market conditions and in connection with the integration of giga and gigagroup in august and january  respectively 
a summary of the key items related to the reorganizations is as follows january  july  august  january  in thousands workforce reduction    facility consolidation and other related costs    depreciable assets   total reorganization charge     accrued severance and facility consolidation costs as of december   critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates  including but not limited to  those related to our revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those that require that most subjective judgment or those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
this is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f revenue recognition 
we generate revenues from licensing research  performing advisory services  and hosting events 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement 
revenues from contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values  which requires us to make estimates of such fair values 
the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions 
research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
advisory service revenues are recognized during the period in which the services are performed 
events revenues are recognized upon completion of the events and are included in our advisory services and other revenue classification 
while our historical business practice has been to offer membership contracts with a non cancelable term  we do from time to time  in response to competitive conditions  offer clients the right to cancel their membership contracts prior to the end of the contract term 
for these cancelable contracts that can be terminated during the contract term  any refund would be issued on a pro rata basis only 
reimbursed out of pocket expenses are recorded as advisory revenue 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses that are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
as of december   deferred revenues and deferred commissions totaled million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments that totaled approximately million as of december  management makes judgments regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of our customers were to improve  the allowances may be reduced accordingly 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in technology related companies and equity investment funds that totaled approximately million as of december  these investments are in companies that are not publicly traded  and  therefore  because no established market for these securities exists  the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies which consists primarily of reviewing the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects 
we record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
during the year ended december   we have no investments that have experienced a decline in value which we believe is permanent or temporary and accordingly no impairment charges have been recorded 
we recorded net impairment charges that totaled approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets 
at december   we had goodwill and identified intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions that totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  we compare the reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value 
determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates based on market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  we have selected november th as the date of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
this analysis did not show an impairment as of november  and as of december   we believe that the carrying value of our goodwill is not impaired 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer base  research content and trademarks and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on an accelerated basis which matches the periods in which those cash flows are estimated to be produced 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether assets have been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset 
income taxes 
we have deferred tax assets related to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards primarily from stock option exercises and the acquisition of giga that totaled approximately million as of december  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and the carryforwards expire 
although realization is not assured  based upon the level of our historical taxable income and our estimates of future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if our estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward periods are incorrect 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  research services advisory services and other total revenues cost of services and fulfillment selling and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of intangible assets reorganization costs integration costs loss income from operations other income  net gains on sales of marketable securities impairments gains from non marketable investments income before income tax provision income tax benefit provision net income years ended december  and december  revenues year ended december  absolute percentage increase increase revenues in millions revenues from research services in millions advisory services and other revenues in millions revenues attributable to customers outside of the united states in millions revenues attributable to customers outside of the united states as a percentage of total revenue number of clients   number of research employees number of events the increase in total revenues as well as the increase in the number of clients is primarily a result of the acquisitions of giga and gigagroup which closed on february  and november   respectively 
the increase in revenues is also attributable to the effects of foreign currency translation which resulted in approximately a positive effect on revenues in no single client company accounted for more than of revenues during or research services revenues as a percentage of total revenues declined from in to in as customer demand is shifting towards advisory services  which is reflected in the increase in advisory services and other revenues 
the increase in advisory services revenues was partially offset by decreasing events revenues 
beginning in  clients purchasing wholeview research member licenses receive event seats as part of the wholeview membership package 
the revenue for these packaged event seats is recognized ratably as research services resulting in a decrease in advisory services and other revenues 
this decrease in advisory services and other revenues in was partially offset by increases in revenues from sales of event sponsorships to third parties 
the increase in international revenues in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues is primarily attributable to the acquisition of gigagroup combined with the favorable effects of foreign currency translation in as compared to cost of services and fulfillment year ended absolute percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease cost of services and fulfillment in millions cost of services and fulfillment as a percentage of total revenues the increase in cost of services and fulfillment is primarily attributable to increased compensation costs resulting from an increase in the number of research employees  increased incentive compensation paid for the performance of advisory services  and increased survey costs

amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in from million in this decrease in amortization expense is primarily attributable to the accelerated method we are using to amortize our acquired intangible assets according to the expected cash flows to be received from these assets 
specifically  research content and registered trademarks that were acquired in connection with the giga acquisition in were fully amortized by the end of reorganization costs 
reorganization costs were million in and consisted primarily of costs associated with lease losses  revisions to the lease loss estimates related to prior reorganizations and fixed asset write offs resulting from office vacancies 
other income  net 
other income  net decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average cash and investment balances available for investment in as compared to gains on sales of marketable securities

the increase in international revenues is primarily attributable to the acquisition of giga 
we invoice our united kingdom customers in pound sterling  the functional currency of our london subsidiary  our continental european customers in euros  the functional currency of our amsterdam subsidiary and all other international customers in us dollars 
assuming the acquisition of giga occurred on january  whereby pre acquisition revenues of giga would be added to forrester s revenues  total revenues would have been million in compared to million in the decrease of million is primarily attributable to a more difficult economic environment in  resulting in lower revenues in because of the annual nature of our contracts and the related revenue recognition policies 
cost of services and fulfillment year ended december  absolute percentage increase increase cost of services and fulfillment in millions cost of services and fulfillment as a percentage of total revenues the increases in cost of services and fulfillment and cost of services and fulfillment as a percentage of total revenues are primarily attributable to greater compensation costs as a result of increased headcount

the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to an increased revenue base as a result of the acquisition of giga 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in these expenses was principally due to the write off of certain depreciable assets in connection with the workforce reorganizations in january and july as well as property and equipment becoming fully depreciated in which is partially offset by additional depreciation expense from fixed assets acquired as part of the acquisition of giga and other capital expenditures during amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from  in this increase in amortization expense is a result of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of giga 
integration costs

the principal purpose of this cash bonus plan was to retain key employees by allowing them to participate in a portion of the potential return from forrester s technology related investments if they remained employed by the company 
the plan was established at a time when technology and internet companies were growing significantly  and providing incentives to retain key employees during that time was important 
to date  we have not paid any bonuses under this plan

the measured cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
the provisions of this statement are effective for all employee equity awards granted on or after july  and to any unvested awards outstanding as of july  retrospective application is permitted 
the adoption of this statement is expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we are currently assessing the transition method we will use upon adoption

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which eliminates the exception of fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in existing accounting literature and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of federal and state government obligations and corporate obligations  with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity except for any future acquisitions or mergers 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity in us dollars dollars in thousands fair value at year ending year ending year ending december  december  december  december  cash equivalents   weighted average interest rate investments     weighted average interest rate total portfolio     weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange 
we invoice our united kingdom customers in pound sterling  the functional currency of our london subsidiary  our continental european customers in euros  the functional currency of our amsterdam subsidiary and all other international customers in us dollars 
on a global level  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
to date  the effect of changes in currency exchange rates has not had a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
accordingly  we have not entered into any hedging agreements 
however  we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations that the euro  or other foreign currencies  will have on foreign exchange exposure if this exposure becomes material 
as of december   the total assets related to non us dollar denominated currencies were approximately million
