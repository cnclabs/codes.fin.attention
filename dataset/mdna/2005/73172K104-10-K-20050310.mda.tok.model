overview we are a leading global provider of a line of high quality  easy to use communications equipment that enables enterprise users to more effectively conduct video  voice  data and web communications 
our offerings are organized along four product lines  video communications  voice communications  network systems  and services 
for reporting purposes  we aggregate video communications and voice communications into one segment named communications and report network systems and services as separate segments 
in january  we sold to verilink corporation  or verilink  certain fixed assets and intellectual property rights relating to our network access product line  including our line of netengine integrated devices 
our consolidated financial statements reflect our network access product line as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas the results of operations of our network access product line that was sold to verilink have been classified as discontinued  and prior periods have been reclassified  including the reallocation of general overhead charges to our three remaining reporting segments 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our discontinued operations 
on january   we completed our acquisition of voyant technologies  inc  or voyant  pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  or merger agreement  dated as of november  voyant designs and delivers group voice communication solutions and is a part of our network systems and services segments 
our consolidated financial results for the year ended december   include the voyant acquisition  which is included in our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows from january   the date of acquisition 
during fiscal  and to a lesser extent during the first quarter of fiscal  our performance  and that of the industry as a whole  was impacted negatively by the global economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending 
while the economic environment remains challenging  technology spending showed signs of improvement and there were indications of an improving economic outlook by the end of fiscal and throughout revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase in revenues primarily reflects increased network system revenues  increased sales volumes of our video and voice 
table of contents communications products  and to a lesser extent  increases in service revenues 
both the network systems and services revenues increases reflect the results of voyant  which are included for all of voyant product and service revenues represented slightly over of total revenues for there were no revenues from voyant in as the voyant acquisition was completed in january in addition  during  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities  net of million paid due to a litigation settlement 
however  our total cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately million  primarily as a result of the net cash outlay of million for the purchase of voyant  million for purchases of our common stock  million for purchases of property and equipment and million of purchases of investments  net of sales and maturities  which was substantially offset by cash generated from operating activities of million and million from proceeds from employee and director stock option exercises and employee purchases of polycom stock in connection with our stock purchase plan 
the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment 
the discussion of our segment operating results is presented for the three years ended december   including voyant s results of operations from january  we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements

services revenues increased to million for from million in  primarily due to increased 
table of contents network system services as a result of the voyant acquisition  which was partially offset by decreases in video related services 
voyant product and service revenues represented slightly over of total revenues for there were no revenues from voyant in as the voyant acquisition was completed in january total revenues for were million  a decrease of million  or  over revenues in the communications  network system and services segments decreased  and  respectively  in over the decrease in communications was due primarily to decreased sales of ipower video product 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased sales volume of our voice communications products and our video communications products other than ipower 
video communications revenues decreased to million for from million in  primarily due to a decrease in sales of our ipower video products  only partially offset by an increase in volumes of our viewstation vsx product line and desktop video products 
voice communications revenues increased to million for from million in  primarily as a result of increases in sales volumes of our installed voice and circuit switched products  and to a lesser extent  increases in our voice over ip products 
revenues from our network systems products decreased to million for from million in  primarily as a result of a reduction in sales volume of our network systems hardware products and mix shifts to lower end systems with lower average selling prices 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in our video system upgrades and software revenue 
services revenues decreased to million for  from million in  due primarily to decreases in ipower related services which were partially offset by increases in video network systems maintenance services 
international sales  or revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
on a regional basis  north america  europe  asia pacific and latin america revenues increased   and  respectively  in over north america revenues increased as a result of increased revenues in the communications segment  including increases in voice and video communication product revenues  and increased revenues in the network systems and services segments  a portion of which was due to the voyant acquisition 
the increased revenues in the communications segment were primarily a result of increases in voice communications product revenues and  to a lesser extent  increases in video communication product revenues 
europe revenues increased as a result of increased revenues in the communications  network systems and services segments 
the increased revenues in the communications segment were primarily a result of increases in video communications product revenues and  to a lesser extent  increases in voice communication product revenues 
asia pacific revenues increased as a result of increased revenues in the communications segment  and to a lesser extent  increases in the network systems and services segments 
the increased revenues in the communications segment were primarily a result of increases in voice communications product revenues and  to a lesser extent  increases in video product revenues 
latin america revenues increased as a result of increased revenues in the communications  network systems and services segments 
the increased revenues in the communications segment were primarily a result of increases in video communications product revenues and  to a lesser extent  increases in voice communication product revenues 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues for the foreseeable future  and we plan to continue our expansion in asia pacific and europe 
international sales  however  are subject to certain inherent risks  including potential economic weakness in international markets  political instability  any adverse economic impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response to those attacks  war or other hostilities  changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates  as happened in the european market in and in the asian market in late  could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in revenue or profitability in that country 
additionally  international revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in the future as we introduce new products  since we expect to initially introduce these products in north america  and also  because of the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
to the 
table of contents extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  especially in our core european markets of france  germany and the united kingdom  our business could be harmed 
for example  revenues in asia decreased sequentially in the third quarter of as compared to the second quarter of and revenues in europe and asia decreased sequentially in the second quarter of as compared to the first quarter of we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
additionally  to date  a substantial majority of our international sales have been denominated in us currency 
however  we may move to international sales being denominated in local currencies in the future  and as a result  these transactions would be subject to currency fluctuation impacts which could adversely affect our financial results 
no customer accounted for more than of our total net revenues or our communications or services segment revenues in  or no one customer accounted for more than of our network systems segment revenues in in and  our network systems segment had two channel partners that  together  represented approximately and  respectively  of network systems segment revenues 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any or all of these channel partners would have a material adverse affect on the net revenues of the segment as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
in  we made a change to our co op marketing program that we provide to our channel partners that will generally result in co op funds being treated as a marketing expense rather than as a revenue reduction as it was previously 
this change will affect how our partners utilize and claim credit for eligible marketing activities and is intended to better leverage our collective marketing efforts 
as a result of this change  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses will all increase in by the amount of co op marketing dollars that would have previously been a reduction of revenues 
this change will have no effect on our net income or cash flows 
for  we recorded approximately million for co op marketing programs as a reduction of revenues  which had the co op marketing program changes been in effect for  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses would have increased by approximately that amount 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions which can result in reductions in capital expenditures by end user customers for our products  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased competition 
these factors adversely impacted our operating results in  and while there has been some improvement in technology spending and the global economy  constraints in technology capital spending still exist and could have an adverse impact on in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a sequential decrease in absolute dollars in revenues from us government entities and  in the first quarter of  we noted a greater decrease in revenue from products with higher average selling prices  such as our network systems products 
any recurrence of these events in could have a similar effect 
in addition  we also face the risk that some of our channel partners have inventory levels in excess of future anticipated sales 
if such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these channel partners for any reason  including a recurrence in of global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending  these channel partners may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods  or product returns may exceed historical or predicted levels  which would harm our business 
in  we launched several new video and voice product offerings 
while we believe we have taken the appropriate measures to educate and train our channel partners  there is a risk that the launch of these new products could cause confusion among our channel partners and end users  thereby causing them to delay purchases of any product until they determine if these new products are more desirable products than our existing products 
such delays in purchases of these new products could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and operating results 
we intend to continue to introduce new products  such as our vsx product family  v  soundstation  soundstation w and pvx products 
in addition  weakness in the end user market for any of our products could negatively affect the revenue and cash flow of our channel partners who could  in turn  delay orders and delay paying their obligations to us 
this could harm our revenues  profitability  financial condition 
table of contents and cash flow 
as a result of changes in sales management and our sales organization  we implemented changes to our partner strategy in north america and plan to continue to implement changes internationally to our channel partner strategy and contracts which may continue to result in a smaller number of channel partners  a change in the mix of our channel partners and a shift to a model with even more direct interaction between us and end user customers 
these changes may cause additional disruptions in our channels and negatively impact revenue growth in the near term 
in addition  the acquisition of voyant added an additional level of complexity to our operations  as a result of their direct sales strategy to service provider customers as we have traditionally fulfilled product orders through a channel partner strategy  and as a result have less experience selling to end user customers  including service provider customers 
we may not obtain the revenue synergies we are anticipating as voyant has a revenue concentration with a few large customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could negatively impact our revenues 
we have also recently integrated the voyant sales team into our worldwide sales organization and made changes in sales management which may cause disruptions in the business and negatively impact revenues in the near term 
in addition  the majority of voyant s orders are received in the last month of a quarter  typically the last few weeks of that quarter  thus the unpredictability of the receipt of these orders could negatively impact our future results 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order  and  therefore backlog has not been a good indicator of future revenues 
revenues for any particular quarter are difficult to predict with any degree of certainty 
as of december   we had million of order backlog as compared to million at december  we include in backlog open product orders which we expect to ship or services which we expect to bill and record revenue for in the following quarter 
once billed  unrecorded service revenue is included in deferred revenue 
in the second and third quarters of  we did end the quarter with a more significant amount of order backlog than our historical experience  principally as a result of our new channel strategy  the establishment of product lead times to maximize our inventory efficiency  our acquisition of voyant in the first quarter of  and our focus on operational efficiencies in the logistics area 
we believe that the current level of backlog could continue to fluctuate 
therefore  there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve the backlog levels of the first three quarters of  and we believe it is unlikely that we will grow to those levels of backlog in future quarters  which is dependent in part on our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly  increased deferred revenue associated with our vsx products and ongoing service deferrals as service revenues increase as a percent of total revenue 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could negatively impact end user orders which in turn could negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
as a result  our backlog could decline to more historical levels or to zero 
cost of revenues year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands product cost of revenues of product revenues pts pts service cost of revenues of service revenues pts pts total cost of revenues of total revenues pts pts cost of product revenues cost of product revenues consists primarily of contract manufacturer costs  including material and direct labor  our manufacturing organization  tooling depreciation  warranty expense  freight expense  royalty payments 
table of contents and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  network systems products have a higher gross margin than our communication products 
overall  product gross margins increased in as compared to as a result of more favorable margins in both our communications and network systems segments 
video and voice margins were favorably impacted due to increased volumes and improved product mix 
network system margins were favorably impacted by an increase in video system volumes and video system upgrades  which were partially offset by a mix shift to lower margin systems and lower gross margins on voyant products 
in the fourth quarter of  gross margins were positively impacted by percentage points as a result of a one time recovery from a vendor for amounts related to a warranty issue 
this recovery did not impact the overall gross margins 
overall  product gross margins increased in as compared to as a result of more favorable margins in the communications segment partially offset by decreases in the gross margins of our network systems segment 
video and voice communications products margins were favorably impacted due to product mix 
network systems had a decrease in volume and a mix shift to lower margin systems 
cost of service revenues cost of service revenues consists primarily of material and direct labor  depreciation  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  services have a lower gross margin than our product gross margins 
overall  service gross margins increased in as compared to as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than related service costs and higher margins on network systems audio services as a result of the voyant acquisition 
service gross margins were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx and v products that was included in the product price and amortized over the twelve months following shipment 
service revenue gross margins declined in as compared to  primarily as a result of relatively fixed costs on lower revenues 
forecasting future gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks associated with maintaining our current gross margin levels 
for example  uncertainties surrounding revenue levels and related production level variances  competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  litigation outcomes and the potential of resulting royalties to third parties  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased part variances  warranty costs and timing of sales over the next few quarters can cause our cost of revenues percentage to vary significantly 
in addition  with the improvement in the economy  we may experience higher prices on commodity components that are included in our products  such as the cost increases for memory devices used in many of our products we experienced in further  in late we began including one year of service with some of our video products which has lowered our gross margins for those products as a result of allocating a portion of our product revenue to deferred service revenue 
however  service gross margins will be favorably impacted when the deferred revenue is recorded as revenue 
in addition  most  if not all of our future products may also have one year of service included with the product  thereby potentially impacting product gross margins negatively  depending on the pricing model we establish for those products 
additionally  our ipower products  voip products and other desktop products have significantly higher costs of revenues than our network systems  viewstation  vsx and soundstation products 
accordingly  any significant revenue growth in our ipower  voip and other desktop products  or a decline in revenue associated with network systems  viewstation and soundstation products will have a negative effect on our gross margins 
also  we may reduce prices on our products in the future for competitive reasons  as a result of a difficult economy  or to stimulate demand  such as occurred in the first quarter of with certain soundstation products  which could increase our cost of revenues percentage 
there is the risk that any of these potential price reductions would not offset competitive pressures or stimulate demand 
in addition  cost variances associated with the manufacturing ramp of new products  or the write off of initial inventory purchases due to product launch delays or the lack of market acceptance of our new products such as our vsx product family  v  soundstation  soundstation w and pvx products or any other new product under development could occur  which would increase our cost of revenues percentage in any quarter 
in addition to the uncertainties listed above  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase due to a change in our mix of distribution channels and the mix of international versus north american revenues 

table of contents additionally  in  we made a change to our co op marketing program that we provide to our channel partners that will generally result in co op funds being treated as a marketing expense rather than a revenue reduction as it was previously 
this change will affect how our partners utilize and claim credit for eligible marketing activities and is intended to better leverage our collective marketing efforts 
as a result of this change  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses will all increase in by the amount of co op marketing dollars that would have previously been a reduction of revenues 
this change will have no effect on our net income or cash flows 
for  we recorded approximately million for co op marketing programs as a reduction of revenues  which had the co op marketing program changes been in effect for  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses would have increased by approximately that amount 
sales and marketing expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of net revenues pts pts sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales force  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
sales and marketing expenses  except for direct marketing expenses  are not allocated to our segments 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues in as compared to is due to the increase in revenues over the year ago period 
the increase in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to increased sales commissions  as a result of improved sales performance against quota  and to a lesser extent due to an increase in our sales and marketing headcount from the voyant acquisition in january additionally  marketing expenses were higher due to increased product launch and trade show activity during the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues in as compared to was due to the decrease in revenues during that same period of time and increased marketing costs 
the increase in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to the overall expansion of our marketing efforts  including the addition of a chief marketing officer  who subsequently left us at the end of the third quarter of  and related staffing and increased allocations of facilities and infrastructure as a result of the increased headcount 
this increase was partially offset by cost containment measures and expense controls we implemented in the second half of and the first half of due to the global economic uncertainty and continued downturn in technology spending 
due to the innovative nature of our products and the effect of competing with much larger companies with much greater resources  such as cisco and microsoft  we believe we will incur increased expenses  especially advertising  to expand the overall market for  drive market penetration of  and increase the adoption rate of our technology and products and to educate potential end users as to the desirability of these products over competing products 
we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts as we expand north american and international markets and increase our sales coverage in existing markets  market new products and expand the public sector 
additionally  in  we made a change to our co op marketing program that we provide to our channel partners that will generally result in co op funds being treated as a marketing expense rather than a revenue reduction as it was previously 
this change will affect how our partners utilize and claim credit for eligible marketing activities and is intended to better leverage our collective marketing efforts 
as a result of this change  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses will all increase in by the amount of co op marketing dollars that would have previously been a reduction of revenues 
this change will have no effect on our net income or cash flows 
for  we recorded approximately million for co op marketing programs as a reduction of revenues  which had the co op marketing program changes been in effect for  revenues  gross profit and marketing expenses would have increased by approximately that amount 

table of contents research and development expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of net revenues pt pts research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs  outside services  expensed materials  depreciation and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for decreased slightly compared to  primarily due to increasing revenues 
the increase in absolute research and development expense dollars to million in as compared to million in  an increase of  was primarily due to increased headcount  headcount related expenses and development spending  which was partially a result of the voyant acquisition in january increases in research and development expenses occurred for the network systems segment and  to a lesser extent  also for the communications segment in as compared to research and development expenses remained flat in absolute dollar amounts in compared to as a result of cost containment measures and expense controls implemented in the second half of and the first half of due to the global economic uncertainty and continued downturn in technology spending 
the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in as compared to is primarily due to the decrease in revenues during that same period of time 
we continued to make investments in improving our existing products  integrating all of our existing and acquired products and developing new products 
in  our network systems segment development expenditures accounted for the slight increase in absolute dollars over this increase was partially offset by decreases in our communications segment  primarily in video product development which accounted for the majority of the offset while voice product development expenditures remained relatively flat 
we are currently investing research and development resources to enhance and upgrade the products that comprise our unified collaboration communications solutions  which encompasses products in our communications and network systems segments 
we anticipate expending a greater proportion of our research and development expenses toward the development of our software and infrastructure products  which are included in the network systems segment  to enhance the integration and interoperability of our entire product suite 
we believe that technological leadership is critical to our success and we are committed to continuing a high level of research and development to develop new technologies and combat competitive pressures 
also  continued investment in new product initiatives will require significant research and development spending 
we expect that research and development expenses in absolute dollars will increase in the future 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of net revenues pt pt general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  professional service fees  allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs  patent litigation costs  including legal costs related to the collaboration properties  inc cpi litigation  and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses are not allocated to our segments 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses 
table of contents decreased by percentage point in  as compared to  due to the increase in revenues from the prior year 
the increase in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily the result of increased legal fees associated with litigation  especially the cpi litigation  annual salary increases and accrued bonuses  increased infrastructure costs and outside services  including increased audit fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of improvements in our accounts receivable aging 
in  the increase in salary and related costs accounted for million of the increase  the increase in legal fees accounted for million of the increase  the increase in outside services accounted for million of the increase and infrastructure costs accounted for million of the increase 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in bad debt expense 
the remaining changes are related to numerous smaller items 
the acquisition of voyant did not add significantly to our general and administrative expense 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased percentage point in over the increase as a percent of revenue in over the comparable prior year is primarily due to the decrease in revenues during that same period of time 
the increase in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses in over the prior year was primarily the result of higher costs associated with accrued bonuses  increased infrastructure costs and outside services  including increased costs associated with new regulatory requirements  patent litigation and increased insurance costs 
these costs were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense and recruiting relocation expense 
in  increases in salaries and related costs accounted for million of the increase  increased infrastructure costs accounted for million and outside services accounted for million of the increase 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in bad debt expense and million decrease in recruiting relocation expense 
the remaining change related to numerous smaller items 
significant charges due to costs associated with litigation or uncollectability of our receivables would increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter they are recorded 
additionally  predicting the timing of bad debt expense associated with uncollectible receivables is difficult 
future quarter general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to visibility of costs  timing of revenue and other factors 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will likely continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future primarily as a result of expansion of our administrative staff and other costs related to supporting a larger company  increased costs associated with regulatory requirements and our continued investments in international regions 
acquisition related costs we recorded charges to operations of million in  million in and million in for acquisition related costs 
these charges primarily include outside financial advisory  accounting  legal and consulting fees and other direct merger related expenses 
the charges in primarily related to professional services costs to integrate voyant after the acquisition in january  and to a lesser extent  additional professional service fees related to the ongoing liquidation of international picturetel legal entities 
the charges in primarily related to professional services costs to integrate and liquidate the international picturetel and accord legal entities and to begin the integration of our acquisition of voyant which closed in january for  the acquisition related charges related primarily to the acquisition of picturetel and consisted primarily of professional services costs to complete the integration of us and picturetel 
if we acquire additional businesses in the future  we may incur material acquisition expenses related to these transactions 
purchased in process research and development in  and  we incurred charges totaling million  zero and million  respectively  for in process research and development 
this research and development was acquired in as part of the voyant acquisition and in as part of the acquisition of meetu 
com  inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amounts allocated to purchased in process research and development were determined by management after considering among other factors  the results of an independent appraisal based on 
table of contents established valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for these in process research and development projects 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and in process research and development for voyant 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the in process research and development projects were discounted at rates ranging from to percent in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technology feasibility 
it is reasonably possible that the development of this technology could fail because of either prohibitive cost  inability to perform the required efforts to complete the technology or other factors outside of our control such as a change in the market for the resulting developed products 
in addition  at such time that the project is completed  it is reasonably possible that the completed products will not receive market acceptance or that we will be unable to produce and market the product cost effectively 
the cost approach  which uses the concept that replacement cost is an indicator of fair value  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the in process research and development acquired in the meetu acquisition 
the cost approach is based on the premise that a prudent investor would pay no more for an asset than the cost to replace that asset with a new one 
replacement cost was based on total costs  net of the unrealized income tax benefit  spent developing the in process technology from meetu s inception through the date the valuation was performed 
the cost approach was selected for the meetu valuation of in process research and development as they were a development stage company at the time of the acquisition with no significant revenue stream 
amortization of purchased intangibles in  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in our acquisitions 
purchased intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives which range from several months to eight years 
the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to is primarily related to the voyant acquisition and the resulting million recorded for purchased intangibles  which accounted for million of the million expensed in partially offsetting this increase related to voyant were picturetel intangibles which became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of under statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  purchased intangibles no longer meeting the criteria to be recorded separately from goodwill must be reclassified to goodwill  and purchased intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives must no longer be amortized 
in the first quarter of  we reclassified approximately million of unamortized acquired workforce recorded as part of the purchase price allocation of the circa acquisition as it did not meet the criteria to be recorded separately from goodwill 
this resulted in a permanent reduction in amortization expense of  per quarter through the first quarter of also under sfas  intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
as a result  we determined that a previously recorded trade name intangible has an indefinite life 
consequently  the trade name intangible is no longer amortized  resulting in a permanent reduction in amortization expense of  per quarter through april in june  we completed the transitional purchased intangible impairment test outlined under sfas which required the assessment of purchased intangibles for impairment as of january   and in october and during the fourth quarters of and  we completed our annual impairment test 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment was conducted by comparing the fair value of the purchased intangible with its carrying amount as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our purchased intangible assets were not impaired as of january  or during  or restructure costs in  management approved a restructuring plan for our network systems segment 
the resulting actions were intended to improve the overall cost structure of the network systems segment by focusing resources on strategic areas of the business  streamlining certain engineering efforts and reducing operating expenses 
in 
table of contents accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  the company recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  this charge consists primarily of severance and other employee termination benefits related to the workforce reductions which comprise less than percent of the company s employees worldwide 
final payments related to this charge will be completed in the first quarter of in  we approved restructuring actions primarily in connection with the sale of the network access product line to verilink and in response to the global economic uncertainty and continued downturn in technology spending 
these actions were meant to improve our overall cost structure by prioritizing resources in strategic areas of the business and reducing operating expenses 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in as a result of these actions 
the charge consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately percent of our employees worldwide 
the restructuring charge related to the communications  services and network systems segments amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
the balance of the restructuring charge related to operating activities which are separately managed at the corporate level and not allocated to segments 
as of december   we had paid all of the million charge 
in  we approved restructuring actions in response to the global economic uncertainty and continued downturn in technology spending and to improve our overall cost structure by prioritizing resources in strategic areas of the business and reducing operating expenses 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in as a result of these actions 
this charge consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately six percent of our employees worldwide 
as of december   we had paid all of this charge 
if the economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending recurs in  we may take additional restructuring actions to reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions  our business could be harmed

litigation reserves and payments during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a settlement agreement with avistar communications  inc avistar and collaboration properties  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of avistar cpi  to settle a patent infringement litigation matter between us 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid avistar a one time amount of million  and cpi agreed to dismiss all claims in the litigation with prejudice 
in addition to the settlement agreement  we  avistar and cpi entered into a patent cross license agreement whereby non exclusive  fully paid up  worldwide patent licenses to the respective patent portfolios of each party and its subsidiaries were granted by us and our subsidiaries to avistar and its subsidiaries  including cpi  and by avistar and its subsidiaries to us and our subsidiaries 
we incurred a one time charge of million in and recorded million as a prepaid license 
we expect to amortize this prepaid license through the third quarter of  the expiration date of the patents in suit 
during the first quarter of  we reached a settlement with a former picturetel customer 
the dispute involved certain services provided by picturetel in and amounts owed to us for providing these services 
we received million which was net of legal fees incurred to litigate and settle the case 
interest income  net interest income  net  consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments less bank charges resulting from the use of our bank accounts and imputed interest expense related to the present value of 
table of contents costs associated with closing facilities as part of the picturetel acquisition and related integration plan 
imputed interest expense was million for  million for and million for interest income  net of interest expense  was million in  million in and million in interest income decreased in over due primarily to decreases in our average cash and investment balances  which was primarily due to cash outlays for the acquisition of voyant  purchases of our common stock and the litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of  and to a lesser extent lower average interest rates that were a result of monetary policy actions taken by the united states federal reserve board to stimulate economic growth in the united states 
average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were in  compared to in interest income decreased in over due primarily to interest rate reductions resulting from the monetary policy actions taken by the united states federal reserve board to stimulate economic growth in the united states 
partially offsetting this negative effect was an increase in our average cash and investment balances which was primarily due to cash generated from operations 
average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were in compared to in interest income  net could fluctuate for due to movement in our cash balances and changes in interest rates related to monetary policy actions  if any  taken by the united states federal reserve board 
loss on strategic investments for strategic reasons  we have made various investments in private companies 
the private company investments are carried at cost and written down to fair market value when indications exist that these investments have other than temporarily declined in value 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and make appropriate reductions in carrying value  if necessary 
we evaluate a number of factors  including price per share of any recent financing  expected timing of additional financing  liquidation preferences  historical and forecast earnings and cash flows  cash burn rate  and technological feasibility of the investee company s products to assess whether or not the investment is impaired 
at december  and  these investments had a carrying value of million and million  respectively 
in and  we made additional investments in two private companies totaling million and million  respectively 
our aggregate investments have been permanently written down a total of million from original cost  including million in and million in  which is reflected in loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
there were no amounts permanently written down in these investments are recorded in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
also included in long term investments are non transferable warrants to purchase common stock of a publicly traded company 
we view these warrants as part of our strategic investments 
these warrants have no readily available fair market value and if exercised would represent less than of the outstanding common stock of this public company 
we adjust the carrying value of these warrants to fair value each period using the black scholes option pricing model 
any gains or losses on these warrants are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in loss on strategic investments 
during  and  we recorded losses totaling million  million and million  respectively  related to these warrants 
provision for income taxes our overall effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively  which resulted in a provision for income taxes  including taxes related to discontinued operations  of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective rate in versus was primarily the result of a one time charge for purchased in process research and development  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the effective rate in versus was primarily the result of a decrease in foreign earnings subject to relatively lower tax rates 

table of contents as of december   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards  million in tax credit carryovers and million in capital loss carryforwards  as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on october   the american jobs creation act the act was signed into law 
the act includes a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the act 
we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in we have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision  however  we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the department of treasury provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language 
until that time  we will make no changes in our current intention to indefinitely reinvest accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
the range of possible amounts of unremitted earnings that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
the related potential range of income tax is between zero and million 
segment information a description of our products and services  as well as annual financial data  for each segment can be found in the business section of this form k and note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
we have adjusted segment financial data for and to reflect the breakout of services as a separate segment effective january  future changes to our organizational structure or business may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed 
the results discussions below include the results of each of our segments for the years ended december   and segment contribution margin includes all segment revenues less the related cost of sales  direct marketing and direct engineering expenses 
management allocates corporate manufacturing costs and some infrastructure costs such as facilities and it costs in determining segment contribution margin 
contribution margin is used  in part  to evaluate the performance of  and allocate resources to  each of the segments 
certain operating expenses are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the corporate level 
these unallocated costs include sales costs  marketing costs other than direct marketing  general and administrative costs  such as legal and accounting  acquisition related costs  amortization of purchased intangible assets  purchased in process research and development costs  restructuring costs  litigation reserves and payments  interest income  net  loss on strategic investments  other expense  net  and provision for income taxes 
communications year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands revenue contribution margin contribution margin as of communication revenues pts pts revenues from our communications segment for increased over  due primarily to increased sales volumes of our video and voice communications products 
video communications revenues  which accounted for percentage points of the overall increase  increased to million for from million in  primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of our viewstation vsx product line  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our ipower and desktop video products

the contribution margin as a percent of communication segment revenues for increased to as compared to in the increase in contribution margin for as compared to is primarily due to higher gross margins for both video and voice communication products  and decreases in engineering and direct marketing spending for video communications 
engineering and direct marketing spending for voice communications remained relatively flat between and gross margins improved for as compared to due to improved product mix 
direct marketing and engineering spending in the communications segment will fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon the timing of product launches and marketing programs 
network systems year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands revenue contribution margin contribution margin as of network systems revenue pts pts revenues from our network systems segment for increased over to million  due primarily to sales of audio network systems as a result of our voyant acquisition and an increase in video network system revenues and  to a lesser extent  increases in video network system upgrades 
these increases were partially offset by a shift in product mix toward products with lower average selling prices 
revenues from our network systems segment for decreased over to million  as a result of a reduction in sales volume of our network systems hardware products and mix shifts to lower end systems with lower average selling prices 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in our video system upgrades and software revenue 

table of contents international revenues  or revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of total network systems revenues for  and  respectively 
the decrease in international network systems revenues as a percentage of network systems revenues for as compared to is due primarily to the concentration of audio network system revenues  which are attributable to the voyant acquisition  in north america 
for  no one customer accounted for more than of network systems segment product revenues 
in and  our network systems segment had two channel partners that together represented approximately and  respectively  of network systems segment product revenues 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any one channel partner would have a material adverse affect on consolidated revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our network systems products from a different channel partner 
in  we began selling our audio network services  a product line resulting from the voyant acquisition  direct to end users and the revenues in this segment from end users are subject to more variability than our segment revenues from our reseller customers 
the loss of one or more of the audio network system customers in the network systems segment could have a material negative impact on our network systems segment and consolidated revenues 
the increase in contribution margin as a percentage of network systems segment revenues for as compared to is due primarily to increased revenues and gross margins  partially offset by increased engineering expenses associated with audio network systems headcount and development spending as a result of the voyant acquisition 
gross margins for network systems were higher in versus primarily due to an increase in video network system upgrades  which were partially offset by decreases in gross margins as a result of an increase in volume but a mix shift to lower margin systems and lower gross margins on audio network system products 
the decrease in contribution margin as a percentage of network systems segment revenues for as compared to is due primarily to lower gross margins  and to a lesser extent  increased engineering and marketing expenses 
gross margins for network systems were lower in versus primarily due to a decrease in volume and a mix shift to lower margin systems 
services year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands revenue contribution margin contribution margin as of service revenue pts pts revenues from our services segment for increased over to million  due primarily to an increase in audio network systems services as a result of our voyant acquisition  and to a lesser extent  increases in video network systems maintenance services

international revenues  or revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of total service revenues for  and  respectively 
the decrease in international services revenues as a percentage of services revenues for as compared to is due primarily to the concentration of audio network systems service revenues  which are attributable to the voyant acquisition  in north america 
no one customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for our services segment for  or 
table of contents overall  service gross margins increased for as compared to as a result of revenue increasing at a faster pace than related service costs and higher margins on network systems audio services as a result of the voyant acquisition 
service gross margins in were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx and v products that was included in the product price and amortized over the twelve month period following shipment 
the increase in contribution margin is due primarily to increased gross margins more than offsetting increases in operating expenses 
overall  service gross margins decreased for compared to  as a result of decreased ipower service revenues more than offsetting decreases in operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
short term and long term investments consist primarily of us government securities  state and local government securities and corporate debt securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have a million line of credit with a bank which was unused at december   however  we do have outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million of which million are secured by this line of credit 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million  net of a million litigation settlement  in  million in  and million in the decrease in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable  smaller decreases in inventories and deferred taxes  and smaller increases in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities  which were partially offset by increased net income and non cash expenses  smaller increases in prepaids and other assets and larger increases in accounts payable 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to decreases in deferred taxes  increases in other accrued liabilities  and increases in accounts payable 
offsetting these positive effects were smaller net income  smaller non cash expenses  larger increases in prepaids and other assets  smaller decreases in accounts receivable and inventories and smaller increases in taxes payable 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was a decrease of million 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million for the acquisition of voyant  million for purchases of our common stock  million for purchases of property and equipment and million of purchases of investments  net of sales and maturities 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities  million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  and million from proceeds from sale of discontinued operations 
the positive cash from operating activities was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  the provision for doubtful accounts  inventory write downs for excess and obsolescence  gain from sale of discontinued operations  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  loss on strategic investments  the purchase of in process research and development and the tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  reductions in inventories and deferred taxes and net increases in accounts payable  taxes payable and other accrued liabilities 
offsetting the positive effect of these items were net increases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
over the past several quarters  our days sales outstanding  or dso  metrics have improved significantly 
our dsos increased from days at december  to days at december  we expect that dso metrics will increase in primarily as a result of the decrease in co op reserves as a result of our change in accounting for co op funds whereby the resulting liability will no longer be recorded as a reserve against receivables but rather in accrued liabilities prospectively 
the increase in dso as a result of the co op change will not have an effect on our net income or cash flows 
we expect that dso metrics will also increase in due to a lesser extent  to revenue increases or as a result of fluctuations in revenue linearity  and as a result of longer payment terms for service 
table of contents providers and government entities 
inventory turns improved from turns at december  to turns at december  there is no assurance that the current level of inventory turns will be maintained and in all likelihood inventory turns will fluctuate as we continue to shorten lead times and reduce air freight costs 
on january   we completed our acquisition of voyant 
we paid million in cash to the voyant shareholders in connection with this acquisition 
approximately million of the cash was placed into escrow to be held as security for losses incurred by us in the event of certain breaches of the representations and warranties covered in the merger agreement or certain other events 
during the second quarter of  the company received million from the escrow account related to certain working capital adjustments  reducing the purchase consideration from million to million 
during the third quarter of  we authorized the release of approximately million of the escrow fund to the voyant shareholders as certain prior sales tax liabilities had been resolved 
voyant shareholders may receive up to an additional million of consideration over a two year period  payable in cash or  at our option  in polycom stock  based on the achievement of certain financial milestones relating to the sale of voyant products 
voyant s results of operations have been included in our results of operations beginning january  in june and august  the board of directors approved plans to purchase up to million shares and million shares  respectively  of the company s common stock in the open market 
as of december   the company had purchased approximately million shares in the open market  for cash of million 
these shares of common stock have been retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued 
during the years ended december   and  the company purchased million  million and million shares of our common stock in the open market for cash of million  million and million  respectively 
the company may continue to purchase shares in the open market 
as of december   the company had purchased all of the approved shares under the june repurchase plan and is authorized to purchase up to an additional million shares under the august repurchase plan through august in  we intend to continue to purchase shares under our current board authorization and we may seek and obtain approval from our board of directors to purchase an additional number of shares 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also currently have commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decide to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 
in november  we entered into a lease amendment for one of our facilities for which we had previously provided a restructuring reserve 
the original term of this lease  which ended in  was amended to allow us to exit the facility in various stages through in exchange for certain cash payments 
in june  we entered into a termination agreement and related payment agreement for this facility which terminated the lease on all of the unoccupied space as of december  the agreement resulted in an overall reduction in our obligations and acceleration of the termination payments that were previously scheduled through in addition  as of december   we have an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of million  which is secured by our line of credit  as security for the remaining termination payment of million which was paid in january these purchase commitments and lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods  services or leases 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit to secure the leases on some of our offices 
these letters of credit total approximately million and are secured by our credit facilities or cash deposits with our banks 

table of contents the table set forth below shows  as of december   the future minimum lease payments  net of estimated sublease income of million through june  due under our current lease obligations 
for example  we lease an approximately  square foot building which is fully subleased to a third party for a term that is concurrent with the term of our lease obligation 
as a result we are not currently showing a lease obligation related to this facility 
if this sublease were to be terminated  or if the tenant defaulted on payment  we would incur additional lease payments that would negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands gross minimum lease payments estimated sublease receipts net minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs other long term liabilities purchase commitments year ending december  thereafter total payments we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  investments and bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by internal audit and the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we 
table of contents believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue  including freight charges  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and the aicpa statement of position no 
 or sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under these guidelines  we recognize revenue on transactions where persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  product payment is not contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
we accrue for sales returns  co op advertising and other allowances as a reduction to revenues upon shipment based upon our contractual obligations and historical experience 
effective in the first quarter of  we have made changes to our co op advertising program that will affect how our channel partners utilize and claim credit for eligible marketing activities that will result in co op funds generally being treated as a marketing expense rather than a revenue reduction in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
additionally  we recognize extended service revenue on our hardware and software products as the service is performed 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  trade in credits  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or competition were to increase further  we may take future actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by estimated product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we consider the following factors when determining if collection of payment is reasonably assured customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms 
if we have no previous experience with the customer  we typically obtain reports from various credit organizations to ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors 
we may also request financial information  including financial statements or other documents eg  bank statements to ensure that the customer has the means of making payment 
if these factors do not indicate collection is reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  as was the case with global crossing and worldcom in and mcsi in  additional allowances would be required 

table of contents excess and obsolete inventory we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have million in net deferred tax assets 
in order to fully utilize these deferred tax assets we need to generate sufficient amounts of future us taxable income 
we believe based upon our financial projections that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these assets and therefore  as of december   we have not established a valuation allowance against these assets 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations the purchase combinations completed require us to identify and estimate the fair value of the assets acquired  including intangible assets other than goodwill  and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
for example  in the picturetel acquisition  we identified vacated or redundant facilities that we intended to sublease or negotiate a lease termination settlement 
for all material acquisitions the allocation period  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  has been completed 
therefore  if actual costs exceed our estimates these charges would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
if actual costs are less than our estimates  these charges would continue to be recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
goodwill and purchased intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would typically measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be 
table of contents commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we accounted for the picturetel  aspi and meetu acquisitions  all of which were completed after july   under the new guidance  and on january   we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from the circa acquisition which was completed prior to july  in june  we completed our transitional goodwill and purchased intangibles impairment tests outlined under sfas which required the assessment of goodwill and purchased intangibles for impairment as of january  and in the fourth quarter of  and  we completed our annual impairment tests 
the assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment was conducted by comparing the fair value of the purchased intangible with its carrying amount as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets and purchased intangible assets were not impaired as of january  or during  or we plan to conduct our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of every year  unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
non marketable securities we periodically make strategic investments in companies whose stock is not currently traded on any stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to us that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
these investments had a carrying value of million as of december   and have been permanently written down by a total of million from original cost  including million in and million in  which is reflected in loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
there were no amounts permanently written down in recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments 
the new impairment model applies to investments accounted for under the cost or equity method and investments accounted for under fas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
eitf no 
also includes new disclosure requirements for cost method investments and for all investments that are in an unrealized loss position 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf no 
 however the disclosure requirements remain effective and the applicable disclosures have been included in our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
we will evaluate the effect  if any  of adopting eitf in november  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
fas  which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with 
table of contents international accounting standards 
fas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
fas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards  including shares issued under certain employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r will require the company to expense sbp awards with compensation cost for sbp transactions measured at fair value 
the fasb originally stated a preference for a lattice model because it believed that a lattice model more fully captures the unique characteristics of employee stock options in the estimate of fair value  as compared to the black scholes model which the company currently uses for its footnote disclosure 
the fasb decided to remove its explicit preference for a lattice model and not require a particular valuation methodology 
sfas no 
r requires us to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in our third quarter of although the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of applying the various provisions of sfas no 
r  we expect that this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
which requires nonmonetary exchanges to be recorded at the fair value of the assets exchanged  with certain exceptions 
this standard requires most exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair value  rather than at carryover basis

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and are not a good indicator of future performance 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are out of our control 
these factors include fluctuations in demand for our products and services  in part due to the changing global economic environment but also as a result of increased competition due to new competitors entering the market or the development of new partnerships  such as the recently announced tandberg and cisco relationship  the prices and performance of our products and those of our existing or potential new competitors  which can change rapidly due to technological innovations  changes to our channel partner programs  such as our co op program  may not be favorably received by our partners and could result in our channel partners adding our competitors products to their portfolio  delaying advertising or sales of our products or shifting emphasis to selling our competitors products  which would negatively impact revenue growth in the near term  changes to our channel partner contracts in europe  asia pacific and latin america which could result in a change in the number and mix of channel partners  a smaller number of channel partners  and the same channel upset already experienced in north america  changes in our sales management and sales organization  including the addition of sales headcount to achieve increased sales coverage  which could result in disruptions among our channel partners and or increased investments in our sales organization without the resulting revenue increases  difficult general economic conditions in north america or other regions of the world  as was the case with the global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending in and  and specific economic conditions prevailing in the communications industry and other technology industries  unpredictable fluctuations in general and administrative costs associated with complying with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and in evaluating our internal control over financial reporting and associated with litigation matters that we may become involved with from time to time  the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement  sfas r  share based payments that will require us to record compensation expense for shares issued under our stock plans beginning in the third quarter of will have a material impact on our results of operations  market acceptance and transition of new product introductions  including the vsx product family  v  soundstation  soundstation w and pvx software and other new products launched in  new products launched in the future  and product enhancements by us or our existing or potential new competitors  the shift in sales mix of products we sell to lower margin products  
table of contents slowing sales by our channel partners to their customers which places further pressure on our channel partners to minimize inventory levels and reduce purchases of our products  the timing  size and mix of the orders for our products  our distribution channels reducing their inventory levels  the level and mix of inventory that we hold to meet future demand  further changes to our channel partner contracts and channel partner strategy  including changes to our channel partner contracts in north america could result in a further reduction in the number of channel partners and to more of our channel partners adding our competitors products to their portfolio  the impact of the unstable political situation in israel and military action by the israeli government and other hostilities in the middle east and their impact on our israeli operations  the shift in revenues to upgrade revenues as opposed to full systems revenues in our network systems segment  which could lead to lower revenues  the ability of our customers  channel partners and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures  fluctuations in the level of international sales and our exposure to international currency fluctuations in both revenues and expenses  the cost and availability of components  such as the recent cost increases for memory devices used in many of our products  manufacturing costs  the level and cost of warranty claims  the impact of disruptions in our operations and at the sites of our primary manufacturing partners in thailand  china  singapore and israel or raw material suppliers to these primary manufacturing partners for any reason  including fire  earthquake or other natural disasters  quarantines  power loss  telecommunications failures and other events beyond our control  future changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices  the near and long term impact of the military action in iraq or other hostilities  the near and long term impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response or uncertainty regarding any military response to those attacks  the level of royalties we must pay to third parties  the impact of seasonality on our various product lines and geographic regions  adverse outcomes in intellectual property matters  and the introduction of web collaboration solutions that compete with our web collaboration or video solutions 
we experienced sequential quarterly revenue growth from through since that time we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to these or other factors 
these and other factors could further prevent us from attaining or sustaining sequential quarterly growth or meeting our expectations regarding our operating results  and investors should not use our past results to predict future operating margins and results 
for example  although we experienced sequential quarterly revenue increases in the second  third and fourth quarters of and throughout  we experienced sequential quarterly revenue decreases in the first quarter of  and the second  third and fourth quarters of  primarily related to declines in our combined video communications and network systems product revenue 
in addition  we incurred a significant net loss in due to charges related to acquisitions completed in that year  as well as a net loss in the first quarter of 
table of contents as a result of these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not a good predictor of our future performance 
if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market securities analysts or investors  our stock price will likely decline 
we face risks associated with our products and product development  including new product introductions and transitions 
our success depends on our ability to assimilate new technologies in our products and to properly train our channel partners in the use of those products 
the markets for video and voice communications and network systems products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the success of our new products depends on several factors  including proper new product definition  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new products  proper positioning of new products in relation to our total product portfolio and their relative pricing  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 
additionally  properly addressing the complexities associated with compatibility issues  channel partner training  technical and sales support as well as field support are also factors that may affect our success in this market 
when we take any significant actions regarding our product offerings  or acquire new product offerings  it is important to educate and train our channel partners to avoid any confusion as to the desirability of the new product offering compared to our existing product offerings 
since october  we have launched several new product offerings  such as our vsx product family  v  soundstation  soundstation w and pvx software 
while we believe we have taken the appropriate measures to educate and train our channel partners  there is a risk that these new products could cause confusion among our channel partners and end users  thereby causing them to delay purchases of any product until they determine if these products are more desirable products than our legacy products 
such delays in purchases could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and operating results in the period of the delay 
these new product launches  or any new product launch in the future  could also cause confusion amongst our channel partners as we educate and train them on  and as they take time to evaluate  these new product offerings 
further  the shift in communications from circuit switched to ip based technologies over time may require us to add new channel partners  enter new markets  such as the service provider market  which we entered into with the acquisition of voyant in january  and gain new core technological competencies 
we are attempting to address these needs  including developing a service provider strategy  and the need to develop new products through our internal development efforts  joint developments with other companies and through acquisitions 
we may not identify successful new product opportunities and develop and bring products to market in a timely manner or be successful in developing a service provider strategy 
additionally  we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
further  as we introduce new products that can or will render existing products obsolete  these product transition cycles may not go smoothly  causing an increased risk of inventory obsolescence and relationship issues with our end user customers and channel partners 
the failure of our new product development efforts  any inability to service or maintain the necessary third party interoperability licenses  our inability to properly manage product transition and our inability to enter new markets  such as the service provider market  would harm our business and results of operations 
we may experience delays in product introductions and our products may contain defects which could adversely affect market acceptance for these products and our reputation and seriously harm our results of operations 
we intend to continue to introduce new products  such as our vsx product family  v  soundstation  soundstation w  and pvx software products 
however  we cannot assure you that new product releases will be timely or that they will be made at all 
for example  the viewstation fx and via video were delayed from their original release dates which we believe negatively affected our revenues in the vsx was also delayed from its original release date 
our video communications product development group is located in massachusetts and texas  our voice communications product development group is dispersed among california  georgia and canada and our 
table of contents network systems product development group is dispersed among colorado  georgia and israel 
therefore  we may experience product delays in the future  due to logistics or other issues involved in coordinating a large geographically diverse product development group 
in the past  we have experienced other delays in the introduction of certain new products and enhancements  and we believe that such delays may occur in the future 
for instance  we experienced delays in introducing the vsx  viewstation mp and webstation from their original expected release dates due to unforeseen technology and or manufacturing ramping issues 
similar delays occurred during the introduction of the soundstation w  showstation  showstation ip and soundstation premier which affected the first customer ship dates of these products 
we also had delays in introducing our soundstation ip product which we believe negatively impacted our sales revenue in the first quarter of further  our soundpoint ip product introduction was delayed which we believe negatively impacted our sales in the third and fourth quarters of any similar delays in the future for other new product offerings currently under development could adversely affect market acceptance for these products and our reputation  and seriously harm our results of operations 
we face risks related to the adoption rate of new technologies 
we have invested significant resources developing products that are dependent on the adoption rate of new technologies 
for example  our soundstation ip and soundpoint ip products are dependent on the roll out of voice over ip  or voip  technologies 
in addition  voip products are traditionally sold through service providers 
our strategy surrounding selling our voip products and developing our service provider network is just being initiated and there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in developing such a strategy or establishing a successful service provider network 
the success of our viavideo ii  vsx and pvx software application products depend on the increased use of desktop video collaboration technologies 
the success of our weboffice product is dependent on the increased use and acceptance of web collaboration technologies in concert with audio and video conferencing 
the success of all of our products is also dependent on how quickly session initiation protocol  or sip  firewall and nat traversal and call management integration technologies are deployed as new technologies and how quickly we adopt and integrate these new technologies into our existing and future products 
if the use of new technologies that our current and future products are based on does not occur  or the development of suitable sales channels does not occur  or occurs more slowly than expected  we may not be able to sell certain of our products in significant volumes and our business may be harmed 
lower than expected market acceptance of our products  price competition and other price decreases would negatively impact our business 
if the market does not accept our products  including the soundstation  soundstation w  the vsx product family  the v and pvx software launched in and  our profitability could be harmed 
our profitability could also be negatively affected in the future as a result of continuing competitive price pressures in the sale of video and voice conferencing equipment and network systems which could cause us to reduce the prices for any of these products or discontinue one product with the intent of simplifying our product offering and enhancing sales of a similar product 
further  we have reduced prices in the past in order to expand the market for our products  and in the future  we may further reduce prices  introduce new products that carry lower margins in order to expand the market or stimulate demand for our products  or discontinue existing products in the hope of stimulating growth in a similar product 
while we cannot assure you that these actions would have the desired result  any of these actions could have an adverse impact on our product margins and profitability 
product obsolescence  excess inventory and other asset impairment can negatively affect our results of operations 
we operate in a high technology industry which is subject to rapid and frequent technology and market demand changes 
these changes can often render existing or developing technologies obsolete 
in addition  the introduction of new products and any related actions to discontinue existing products can cause existing 
table of contents inventory to become obsolete 
these obsolescence issues can require write downs in inventory value when it is determined that the recorded value of existing inventory is greater than its fair market value 
for example  this situation occurred in the third quarter of as we wrote down inventories of a product in development as a result of a delay in the product introduction 
also  the pace of change in technology development and in the release of new products has increased and is expected to continue to increase 
if sales of one of these products have a negative effect on sales of another of our products  it could significantly increase the inventory levels of the negatively impacted product 
for each of our products  the potential exists for new products to render existing products obsolete  cause inventories of existing products to increase  cause us to discontinue a product or reduce the demand for existing products 
in addition to our acquisition of voyant in january  we purchased several businesses in and  which together include goodwill valued at approximately million and other purchased intangible assets valued at approximately million as of december  this represents a significant portion of our recorded assets 
generally accepted accounting principles related to goodwill and other intangibles changed with the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets which we adopted effective january  under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but must be reviewed for impairment at least annually or sooner under certain circumstances 
other intangible assets that are deemed to have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives  but must be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist  or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  we cannot assure you that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests 
if impairment is deemed to exist  we would write down the recorded value of these intangible assets to their fair values which could result in a full write off of their book value 
if these write downs do occur  they could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we have made investments in private companies which we classify as other assets in our balance sheets 
the value of these investments is influenced by many factors  including the operating effectiveness of these companies  the overall health of these companies industries  the strength of the private equity markets and general market conditions 
due to these and other factors  we have recorded charges against earnings totaling million  including million in fiscal and million in fiscal  associated with the impairment of these investments  which has been reflected in loss on strategic investments in the statements of operations 
as of december   our investments in private companies are valued at million 
we may make additional investments in private companies which would be subject to similar impairment risks  and these impairment risks may cause us to write down the recorded value of any such investments 
further  we cannot assure you that future inventory  investment  license  fixed asset or other asset write downs will not happen 
if future write downs do occur  they could harm our business and results of operations 
failure to adequately service and support our products could harm our results of operations 
our recent growth has been due in large part to an expansion into products with more complex technologies  including our network systems products  new video product offerings and our software products 
this has increased the need for product warranty and service capabilities 
if we cannot develop and train our internal support organization or maintain our relationship with our outside technical support provider  it could harm our business 
in addition  we are including one year of maintenance support with the purchase of the vsx product family and the v products 
we view this service offering and other service offerings to be a key success factor in our business 
we are currently reorganizing our service organization to  among other things  more fully integrate the 
table of contents service businesses of our recent acquisitions 
as part of this effort  we are also implementing a new customer relationship management system  which we expect to provide better information for us to provide improved customer support 
if we do not manage this difficult reorganization properly  we could alienate our customers or channel partners which could harm our business and results of operations 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions which can result in reductions in capital expenditures by end user customers for our products  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased competition 
these factors adversely impacted our operating results in  and while there has been some improvement in technology spending and the global economy  constraints in technology capital spending still exist and could have an adverse impact on for example  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a sequential decrease in absolute dollars in revenues from us government entities and in the first quarter of  we noted a greater decrease in revenue from products with higher average selling prices  such as our network systems products  which we believe resulted from adverse economic conditions 
any recurrence of these events could have a similar effect 
in addition  we also face the risk that some of our channel partners have inventory levels in excess of future anticipated sales 
if such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these channel partners for any reason  including a recurrence in of global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending  these channel partners may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods  or product returns may exceed historical or predicted levels which would harm our business 
if we fail to compete successfully  our business and results of operations would be significantly harmed 
we face significant competition in the communications industry which is subject to rapid technological change 
in video communications  our major competitors include tandberg and a number of other companies including aethra  avistar  d link  huawei  leadtek  nec  panasonic  sony  vcon  vtel and zte  as well as various smaller or new industry entrants 
some of these companies have substantial financial resources and production  marketing  engineering and other capabilities with which to develop  manufacture  market and sell their products 
in addition  with advances in telecommunications standards  connectivity and video processing technology and the increasing market acceptance of video communications  other established or new companies may develop or market products competitive with our video communications products or may partner with companies which have more substantial financial resources and production  marketing  engineering and other capabilities with which to develop  manufacture  market or sell their products 
for example  tandberg  a major competitor in video communications  recently announced a strategic relationship with cisco systems  whereby tandberg will provide cisco systems with technology that will be co branded and sold by cisco systems 
since the second quarter of  we have experienced greater losses in group video conferencing sales to our competitors  including competition we are experiencing at lower price points from competitors in china 
we expect to continue to face stiff competition from tandberg  and they may continue to gain market share from us  due in part to their strategic relationship with cisco and their latest product offerings 
in addition  we believe we will face increasing competition from alternative video communications solutions that employ new technologies or new combinations of technologies from companies such as cisco systems  com  hewlett packard  dell  microsoft  nortel networks  realnetworks and webex  that enable web based or network based video and collaboration communications 
the market for voice communications equipment  including voice conferencing and desktop equipment  is highly competitive and also subject to rapid technological change  regulatory developments and emerging industry standards 
we expect competition to persist and increase in the future in this area 
in voice communications  our major competitors include aethra  clearone communications  konftel  mitel and other companies that offer lower cost  full duplex speakerphones 
there are also several low cost manufacturers in asia and europe that are emerging with voip desktop products competitive with ours 
in 
table of contents addition  there are notable pbx and ip call manager manufacturers that compete with standards based ip products including avaya  cisco systems  mitel and siemens 
furthermore  all major telephony manufacturers produce hands free speakerphone units that are lower cost than our voice communications products 
our video network systems business has significant direct competition from radvision  and a number of other companies  including cisco systems  first virtual  huawei and tandberg 
our audio network systems business has significant competition from companies such as spectel  which was recently acquired by avaya  compunetix and latitude 
for our services business  we see the competition potentially coming from a number of companies  including cisco systems and nortel  as we believe these vendors will look at our products as potential service revenue streams  in addition to trying to provide one service solution to their customers 
today third party maintenance companies are not a big threat to our service base  but as the industry continues to grow  this may become a concern over time 
in addition  it is possible that we will see increased competition in all of our product lines to the extent that one or more of our competitors join together either through mutual agreement or acquisitions to form new partnerships to compete against us 
these competitors on a stand alone basis or on a combined basis could have more substantial financial resources and production  marketing  engineering and other capabilities with which to develop  manufacture  market and sell their products 
the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to provide and sell a broad range of products and services that are responsive to changing technology and changing customer requirements  product performance  price  the ability to introduce new products  including products with price performance advantages  the ability to reduce production costs  the ability to provide value added features  the ability to successfully integrate our products with  and operate our products on  existing customer platforms  market presence  and the ability to provide financing 
competition that we face in the north american market is intense and  in particular  we noted a softening in our north american sales in the fourth quarter of whether this fourth quarter softening was due to stiffer competition in the region  or due to other factors that are difficult to predict such as a reduction in federal spending or an economic slowdown  if such trend continues  our financial results may be adversely impacted 
in addition  competition that we face in certain of our international markets is different than that we face in north america and continually changing 
for instance  we have noted increased pricing pressures in china  india and other parts of asia 
if we are unable to compete effectively in these regions in terms of price  technology  product offerings or marketing strategies  our overall financial results may suffer 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved performance characteristics 
new product introductions by our competitors could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products and future products 
we believe that the possible effects from ongoing competition may be the reduction in the prices of our products and our competitors products  the introduction of additional lower priced competitive products or the introduction of new products or product platforms that render our existing products or technologies obsolete 
we expect this increased competitive pressure may lead to intensified price based competition  resulting in lower prices and gross margins which would significantly harm our results of operations 

table of contents our operating results are hard to predict if a disproportionate amount of our sales occur at the end of a quarter 
the timing of our channel partner orders and product shipments can harm our operating results 
our quarterly revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of channel partner orders received during a given quarter and the percentage of each order that we are able to ship and recognize as revenue during each quarter  each of which is extremely difficult to forecast 
moreover  prior to the second half of  the majority of our orders in a given quarter shipped in the last month of that quarter and sometimes in the last few weeks of the quarter 
throughout and through the second quarter of  the amount of our order backlog steadily increased  principally as a result of our new channel strategy  the establishment of product lead times to maximize our inventory efficiency  our acquisition of voyant  and our focus on operational efficiencies in the logistics area 
in the fourth quarter of  our backlog decreased significantly due in part to a decrease in current quarter bookings as a percentage of revenue  shorter lead times and an increase in deferred revenue from carve outs associated with the increase in shipments of our vsx product family  which include the first year of maintenance and support 
we believe that the current level of backlog will continue to fluctuate and that it is unlikely that we will grow backlog to the levels of the second and third quarters of in future quarters  due to many factors such as ability of our sales force to generate orders linearly throughout the quarter  our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly  increased deferred revenue associated with our vsx products  and ongoing service deferrals as service revenues increase as a percent of total revenue 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could significantly negatively impact end user orders which could in turn negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
as a result  our backlog could further decline in future quarters  even to zero 
the return to historical linearity levels or any failure or delay in the closing of orders during the last part of a quarter would materially harm our operating results  as occurred in the first quarter of and the second and third quarters of furthermore  we may be unable to ship products in the period we receive the order  due to these or other factors  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
in such events  the price of our common stock would decline 
difficulty in estimating channel partner orders can harm our operating results  the establishment of product lead times to maximize our inventory efficiency and our focus on operations efficiency in the logistics area 
revenues for any particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict with any degree of certainty 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order and therefore  backlog is not a good indicator of future revenues 
in the second and third quarters of  we did end the quarter with a more significant amount of order backlog than our historical experience  principally as a result of our new channel strategy  the establishment of product lead times to maximize our inventory efficiency  our acquisition of voyant in the first quarter of  and our focus on operational efficiencies in the logistics area 
we believe that the current level of backlog will continue to fluctuate and that it is unlikely that we will grow backlog to the levels of the second and third quarters of in future quarters  which is dependent in part on our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly  increased deferred revenue associated with our vsx products and ongoing service deferrals as service revenues increase as a percent of total revenue 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could negatively impact end user orders which could in turn significantly negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
accordingly  our expectations for both short and long term future revenues are based almost exclusively on our own estimate of future demand and not on firm channel partner orders 
our expense levels are based largely on these estimates 
in addition  the majority of voyant s orders are received in the last month of a quarter  typically the last few weeks of that quarter  thus the unpredictability of the receipt of these orders could negatively impact our future results 
we historically have received a majority of our channel partner orders in the last month of a quarter and often in the last few weeks of the quarter 
in the event that order linearity declines to the levels experienced in and the first half of  where the majority of our sales occurred in the last month of the quarter  or if for any reason orders and revenues do not meet our expectations in a particular period  we will be limited in our ability to reduce expenses quickly 
accordingly  any 
table of contents significant shortfall in demand for our products in relation to our expectations would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we face risks related to our dependence on channel partners to sell our products 
to avoid confusion among our channel partners regarding our product offerings  we need to devote significant resources to educating and training them 
when we take any significant actions regarding our product offerings  or acquire new product offerings  it is important to educate and train our channel partners to avoid any confusion on the desirability of the new product offering in relation to our existing product offerings 
since october  we have launched several new video and voice products  including the vsx product family  v  soundstation  soundstation w and pvx software 
while we believe we have taken the appropriate measures to educate and train our channel partners  there is a risk that the launch of these new products could cause confusion among our channel partners and end users  thereby causing them to delay purchases of any video or voice products  until they determine if these new products are more desirable products than our legacy products 
such delays in purchases could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and operating results in the period of the delay 
these new product launches  or any new product launch in the future  could cause confusion amongst our channel partners as we educate and train them on  and as they take time to evaluate  these new product offerings 
integrating acquired product offerings with ours has created confusion among our channel partners in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
we will need to continue to devote significant resources to educate and train our channel partners about our product offerings 
channel confusion could also occur if we do not adequately train or educate the channel on our product families especially in the cases where we simplify our product offerings by discontinuing one product in order to stimulate growth of a similar product 
ongoing confusion may lead to delays in ordering our products which would negatively affect our revenues 
conflicts with our channel partners could hurt sales of our products 
we have various oem agreements with major telecommunications equipment manufacturers  such as avaya  cisco systems and nortel networks  whereby we manufacture our products to work with the equipment of the oem 
these relationships can create conflicts with our other channel partners who directly compete with our oem partners  or could create conflicts among our oem partners who compete with each other  which could adversely affect revenues from these other channel partners or our oem partners 
conflicts among our oem partners could also make continued partnering with these oem partners increasingly difficult 
because many of our channel partners also sell equipment that competes with our products  these channel partners could devote more attention to these other products which could harm our business 
for example  a significant amount of our network systems revenues in were generated from sales to tandberg  sony and vcon  which compete with us in the video communications product market 
we believe that because of this conflict  they significantly reduced their orders of our network systems products in and  which impacted our sales of this product line 
further  other channel conflicts could arise which cause channel partners to devote resources to other non polycom communications equipment which would negatively affect our business or results of operations 
some of our current and future products are directly competitive with the products of our channel and strategic partners 
for example  we have an agreement with cisco systems under which we ship soundstation ip conference phones for resale by cisco systems 
in addition  cisco sells a network systems product which is in direct competition with our network systems offerings and recently announced an extended partnership with tandberg  one of our major competitors in the video communications business  whereby tandberg will provide cisco systems with technology that will be co branded and sold by cisco systems 
as a consequence of conflicts such as these  there is the potential for our channel and strategic partners to significantly reduce their orders of our products or design our technology out of their products 
in addition  competition with our partners in all of the markets in which we operate is likely to increase  potentially resulting in strains on our existing relationships 
table of contents with these companies 
any such strain could limit the potential contribution of our strategic relationships to our business  restrict our ability to form strategic relationships with these companies in the future and create additional competitive pressures on us  including downward pressure on our average selling prices which would result in a decrease in both revenues and gross margins  any of which could harm our business 
we are subject to risks associated with our channel partners product inventories and product sell through 
we sell a significant amount of our products to channel partners who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end users 
if these channel partners are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if channel partners decide to decrease their inventories for any reason  such as a recurrence of the global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending  the volume of our sales to these channel partners and our revenues would be negatively affected 
for example  the economic downturn negatively affected our business and operating results in  and the global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending negatively affected our business and operating results in and the first quarter of while there has been some improvement in technology spending and the global economy  constraints in technology capital spending still exist and if these conditions recur in the future  our business and operating results will continue to be negatively affected 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a sequential decrease in absolute dollars in revenues from us government entities 
in addition  if channel partners decide to purchase more inventory  due to product availability or other reasons  than is required to satisfy end user demand or if end user demand does not keep pace with the additional inventory purchases  channel inventory could grow in any particular quarter which could adversely affect product revenues in the subsequent quarter 
moreover  if we choose to eliminate or reduce special cost or stocking incentive programs  quarterly revenues may fail to meet our expectations or be lower than historical levels 
in addition  as a result of changes in sales management and our sales organization  we have implemented changes to our partner strategy in north america and plan to continue to implement changes  internationally to our channel partner strategy and contracts which may continue to result in a smaller number of channel partners  a change in the mix of our channel partners and a shift to a model with even more direct interaction between us and our direct end user customers 
this strategy shift includes channel certifications for certain network systems and video products that we believe yield a higher level of end user customer satisfaction 
as part of this new channel partner strategy and a result of the global economic downturn  the channel inventory model changed to reduce channel inventories at those channel partners that stock product and to move some channel partners to a drop shipment method for their end user customers as opposed to having these partners carry inventory 
during the second quarter of  we believe that we essentially completed our channel inventory reduction program and we believe that  in aggregate  we will see only minor variations  upwards or downwards  in channel inventory weeks within product lines or regions moving forward 
this channel strategy has and could continue to upset our channel partners to the extent that they could add competitive products to their portfolios or shift more emphasis to selling our competitors products 
these changes may continue to cause disruptions in our channels and negatively impact revenue growth in the near term 
our revenue estimates associated with products stocked by some of our channel partners are based largely on end user sales reports that our channel partners provide to us on a monthly basis 
to date  we believe this data has been generally accurate 
to the extent that this sales out and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received timely  we may not be able to make revenue estimates for future periods 
changes to our channel partner programs may not be favorably received and as a result our channel partner relationships and results of operations may be adversely impacted 
our channel partners are eligible to participate in various incentive programs  depending upon their contractual arrangements with us 
as part of these arrangements  we have the right to make changes in our programs and launch new programs as business conditions warrant 
for example  we recently announced changes to our co op marketing programs which will affect how our partners utilize and claim credit for eligible 
table of contents marketing activities 
while we believe this change will allow us to better focus and leverage our collective marketing efforts  this change could cause disruptions in our channels and negatively impact revenue growth in the near term 
these changes could upset our channel partners to the extent that they could add competitive products to their portfolios  delay advertising or sales of our products  or shift more emphasis to selling our competitors products  if not appropriately handled 
there can be no assurance that our channel partners will be receptive to this change and that we will receive the positive benefits that we are anticipating in making these program changes 
we are subject to risks associated with the success of the businesses of our channel partners 
many of our channel partners that carry multiple polycom products  and from whom we derive significant revenues  are undercapitalized 
the failure of these businesses to establish and sustain profitability or obtain financing could have a significant negative effect on our future revenue levels and profitability and our ability to collect our receivables 
further  while there has been some improvement in technology spending and the global economy  constraints in technology capital spending still exist and could cause more of our channel partners businesses to suffer or fail  which would harm our business 
our business has been harmed and could be harmed further if our large channel partners continue to be affected by the recurrence of global economic uncertainty and a downturn in technology spending 
for example  in  we experienced a decline in revenues from worldcom  global crossing and mcsi due to their financial troubles 
this drop in the amount of orders we have received from these three channel partners negatively affected our revenues and profitability 
our channel partner contracts are typically short term and early termination of these contracts may harm our results of operations 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our channel partners  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our channel partners 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the channel partner 
in the event of an early termination by or loss of one of our major channel partners  we believe that the end user customer would likely purchase from another one of our channel partners 
if this did not occur and we were unable to rapidly replace that revenue source its loss would harm our results of operations 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues 
sales of some of our products have experienced seasonal fluctuations which have affected sequential growth rates for these products  particularly in our third and first quarters 
for example  there is generally a slowdown for sales of our products in the european region in the third quarter of each year and sales to government entities typically slow in our fourth quarter and to a greater extent in our first quarter 
in addition  sales of our video communications products have typically declined in the first quarter of the year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
seasonal fluctuations could negatively affect our business  which could cause our operating results to fall short of anticipated results for such quarters  as they did in the first quarter of difficulties we may encounter managing a substantially larger business could adversely affect our operating results 
if we fail to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel  our business will be harmed 
our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel  especially in light of our recent additions of senior management  reorganizations and restructurings 
in addition  provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and related rules of the sec and nasdaq impose 
table of contents heightened personal liability on some of our key management personnel 
the threat of such liability could make it more difficult to identify and hire and retain highly skilled management personnel 
the loss of any key employee  the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees  particularly technical and management  as needed  could harm our business 
in addition  as we add more complex software product offerings  it will become increasingly important to retain and attract individuals who are skilled in managing and developing these complex software product offerings 
further  many of our key employees in israel  who are responsible for development of our network systems products  are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty and may be called to active duty at any time under emergency conditions 
the loss of the services of any executive officer or other key technical or management personnel could harm our business 
we experienced significant growth in our business and operations due to internal expansion and business acquisitions during the last five years  and if we do not appropriately manage this growth and any future growth  our operating results will be negatively affected 
our business has grown in recent years through both internal expansion and business acquisitions  and continued growth may cause a significant strain on our infrastructure  internal systems and managerial resources 
for example  our annual revenues increased from million in to million in  and during that time  we acquired accord  circa  picturetel  aspi  meetu and voyant 
further  our headcount increased from employees at december  to  employees at december  to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our infrastructure  including information technology and financial operating and administrative systems and controls  and continue managing headcount  capital and processes in an efficient manner 
our productivity and the quality of our products may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively and coordinate among our executive  engineering  finance  marketing  sales  operations and customer support organizations  all of which add to the complexity of our organization and increase our operating expenses 
in addition  our information technology systems may not grow at a sufficient rate to keep up with the processing and information demands place on them by a much larger company 
the efforts to continue to expand our information technology systems or our inability to do so could harm our business 
further  revenues may not grow at a sufficient rate to absorb the costs associated with a larger overall headcount 
our future growth may require significant additional resources given that  as we increase our business operations in complexity and scale  we may have insufficient management capabilities and internal bandwidth to manage our growth and business effectively 
we cannot assure you that resources will be available when we need them or that we will have sufficient capital to fund these potential resource needs 
also  as we assess our resources following our acquisitions  we will likely determine that redundancy in certain areas will require consolidation of these resources 
any organizational disruptions associated with the consolidation process could require further management attention and financial expenditures 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  if we experience a shortfall in resources or if we must take additional restructuring charges  our results of operations will be harmed 
difficulties in integrating our acquisitions could adversely impact our business 
difficulties in integrating past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our business 
we completed the acquisition of voyant in january the process of integrating voyant into our operations has required and will continue to require significant resources and has been and will continue to be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to our business 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of this acquisition or to successfully integrate the operations of voyant could harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from this acquisition because of the following significant challenges potentially incompatible cultural differences between the two companies  
table of contents revenue concentration with a few large service provider customers  majority of orders received in the last month of a quarter  typically the last few weeks of that quarter and the unpredictability of receipt of orders  incorporating voyant s technology and products into our current and future product lines  geographic dispersion of operations  generating marketing demand for an expanded product line  integrating voyant s products with our business  as we have limited experience in the service provider market  the difficulty in leveraging voyant s and our combined technologies and capabilities across all product lines and customer bases  and our inability to retain previous voyant customers or employees 
in addition  revenues related to this acquisition experienced a sequential quarterly decrease of in the fourth quarter of although management has taken steps to address the performance of this product line  including integrating the voyant sales team into our worldwide sales organization and making changes in sales management  we may be unsuccessful in our efforts and our results of operations may be negatively impacted 
the picturetel acquisition  which we completed in october  is the largest acquisition we have completed  and the complex process of integrating picturetel required significant resources 
we continue to face ongoing business challenges that include principally the geographic dispersion of our operations and generating market demand for an expanded product line that includes pc based systems and collaboration intensive applications 
although the integration of picturetel is complete  we will continue to incur cash outflows and additional costs related to this acquisition  primarily related to fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in dissolving legal entities no longer being used 
we have spent and will continue to spend significant resources identifying and acquiring businesses 
the efficient and effective integration of our acquired businesses into our organization is critical to our growth 
any future acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these and any future acquisitions or to successfully integrate the operations of the companies we acquire could also harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will not incur material charges in future quarters to reflect additional costs associated with past acquisitions or any future acquisitions we may make 
our failure to implement our restructuring plan related to picturetel facilities could adversely impact our business 
we have a significant liability of approximately million at december  related to vacant and redundant facilities in connection with our acquisition of picturetel  which is net of estimated sublease income we expect to generate 
our estimate of sublease income is based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
if actual sublease income is lower than our estimates for any reason  if it takes us longer than we estimated to sublease these facilities  or if the associated cost of subleasing or terminating our lease obligations for these facilities is greater than we estimated  we would incur additional charges to operations which would harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
for example  we have an approximately  square foot building which is fully subleased to a third party for the length of our lease obligation 
if this tenant were unable to fulfill  for any reason  their contractual obligations under the sublease  we would incur additional charges to operations which would harm our business 
in addition  until our vacated and redundant facilities are subleased or the lease obligations for these facilities are terminated  we will continue to pay the 
table of contents contractual lease and facility operating expense obligations without any sublease income to offset these costs 
further  in the event that we agree to sublease a facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow up to and potentially exceeding our recorded liability at the time of such transaction  which would harm our operating cash flows 
to the extent that any such cash outflows or additional costs exceed the amount of our recorded liability related to the sublease or termination of these lease obligations  we could incur a charge to operations which would harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 
we face risks related to our international operations and sales 
because of our significant operations in israel  we are subject to risks associated with the military  political and regulatory environment in israel and the middle east region 
the principal research and development and manufacturing facilities of our network systems group and many of that group s suppliers are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel and the middle east region directly affect our network systems group s operations 
a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its geographic neighbors 
current and future armed conflicts or political instability in the region may impair our ability to produce and sell our network systems products and could disrupt research or developmental activities 
this instability could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
further  the military action in iraq or other countries in the region perceived as a threat by the united states government could result in additional unrest or cause israel to be attacked which would adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business 
the technology used to develop our current network systems products was developed in part with grants from the israeli office of the chief scientist 
under israeli law  technology developed pursuant to grants from the office of the chief scientist cannot be transferred to any person without the prior written consent of the office of the chief scientist 
the grants also contain restrictions on the ability to manufacture products developed with these grants outside of israel 
approval to manufacture such products outside of israel  if granted  is generally subject to an increase in the total amount to be repaid to the office of the chief scientist of between to of the amount granted  depending on the extent of the manufacturing to be conducted outside of israel 
these restrictions on the ability to transfer certain of our technology to third parties or manufacture products outside israel may adversely affect our operating results and the development of additional network systems products and significantly reduce the value of the technology 
we are in the process of developing and implementing a disaster recovery plan that could provide for manufacturing to be performed outside of israel on a limited basis today  and a more extended basis in the event of a disaster 
the implementation of such a disaster recovery plan could subject us to additional payments to the office of the chief scientist  which could adversely affect our operating results 
international sales and expenses represent an increasing portion of our revenues and operating expenses and risks inherent in international operations could harm our business 
international sales and expenses represent an increasing portion of our revenues and operating expenses  and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future and that international operating expenses will continue to increase 
international sales and expenses are subject to certain inherent risks  including the following adverse economic conditions in international markets  the near and long term impact of the military action in iraq or other hostilities  disruptions in business due to natural disasters  quarantines or other events beyond our control  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  adverse economic impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response to those attacks  
table of contents difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  potentially adverse tax consequences  and potential foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
international revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in the future as we introduce new products 
these fluctuations are primarily the result of our practice of introducing new products in north america first and the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
to the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  especially in our core european markets of france  germany and the united kingdom  our business could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
although  to date  a substantial majority of our international sales has been denominated in us currency  we expect that a growing number of sales could be denominated in non us currencies as more international customers request billing in their currency 
our international operating expenses are denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  we expect our business will be significantly more vulnerable to currency fluctuations which could adversely impact our results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors currently invoice in foreign currency  which could be a disadvantage to us 
in and  our operating costs internationally have increased as a result of the weakness in the us dollar 
these currency fluctuations are recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  as a result of our increased exposure to currency fluctuations  we from time to time engage in currency hedging activities solely to mitigate temporary currency fluctuation exposure 
however  we have limited experience with these hedging activities  and they may not be successful which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates  as happened in the european market in and in the asian market in late  could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in revenue or profitability in that country  as discounts may be temporarily or permanently affected 
we have limited supply sources for some key components of our products  and our operations could be harmed by supply interruptions  component defects or unavailability of these components 
some key components used in our products are currently available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources  including some key integrated circuits and optical elements 
we also obtain certain plastic housings  metal castings and other components from suppliers located in china and certain southeast asia countries  and any political or economic instability in that region in the future  quarantines or other restrictions associated with infectious diseases  or future import restrictions  may cause delays or an inability to obtain these supplies 
further  we have suppliers in israel and the military action in iraq or war with other middle eastern countries perceived as a threat by the united states government may cause delays or an inability to obtain supplies for our network systems products 
we have no raw material supply commitments from our suppliers and generally purchase components on a purchase order basis either directly or through our contract manufacturers 
some of the components included in our products  such as microprocessors and other integrated circuits  have from time to time been subject to limited allocations by suppliers 
in addition  companies with limited or uncertain financial resources manufacture some of these components 
in the event that we  or our contract manufacturers  are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of components  develop alternative sources as needed  or companies with limited financial resources go out of business  our operating results could be seriously harmed 
moreover  our operating results would be seriously harmed by receipt of a significant number of defective components  an increase in component prices  such as the recent increases for memory devices  or our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive price reductions 

table of contents additionally  our video communications products are designed based on integrated circuits produced by philips semiconductor  or philips and equator technologies  and cameras produced by sony 
if we could no longer obtain integrated circuits or cameras from these suppliers  we would incur substantial expense and take substantial time in redesigning our products to be compatible with components from other manufacturers  and we cannot assure you that we would be successful in obtaining these components from alternative sources in a timely or cost effective manner 
additionally  both sony and philips compete with us in the video communications industry which may adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary components 
the failure to obtain adequate supplies of vital components could prevent or delay product shipments which could harm our business 
we also rely on the introduction schedules of some key components in the development or launch of new products 
any delays in the availability of these key components could harm our business 
in addition  the business failure or financial instability of any supplier of these components could adversely affect our cash flows if we were to expend funds in some manner to ensure our supply of those components 
manufacturing disruption or capacity constraints would harm our business 
we subcontract the manufacture of our voice and video product lines to celestica  a third party contract manufacturer 
we use celestica s facilities in thailand  china and singapore  and should there be any disruption in services due to natural disaster  quarantines or other restrictions associated infectious diseases  or other similar events  or economic or political difficulties in any of these countries or asia or any other reason  such disruption would harm our business and results of operations 
also  celestica s facilities are currently the primary source manufacturer of these products  and if celestica experiences an interruption in operations or otherwise suffers from capacity constraints  we would experience a delay in shipping these products which would have an immediate negative impact on our revenues 
as a result  we may not be able to meet demand for our products which could negatively affect revenues in the quarter of the disruption and harm our reputation 
in addition  operating in the international environment exposes us to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences  all of which could harm our business and results of operations 
further  our network systems products are manufactured in israel which is currently experiencing internal and external conflicts that include terrorist acts and military action 
also  political conflict in israel  the military action in iraq or war with other middle eastern countries perceived as a threat by the united states government could cause us to experience a manufacturing disruption due to acts associated with these conflicts which could harm our business 
in addition  certain technology used in our network systems products was developed through grants from the office of the chief scientist in israel 
under israeli law  it is prohibited to transfer technology developed pursuant to these grants to any person without the prior written consent of the office of the chief scientist 
the grants also contain restrictions on the ability to manufacture products developed with these grants outside of israel 
approval to manufacture such products outside of israel  if granted  is generally subject to an increase in the total amount to be repaid to the office of the chief scientist of between to of the amount granted  depending on the extent of the manufacturing to be conducted outside of israel 
these restrictions on the ability to transfer technology to third parties or manufacture products outside israel may adversely affect our operating results and significantly reduce the value of the technology developed under these grants 
we are in the process of developing and implementing a disaster recovery plan that could call for manufacturing to be performed outside of israel on a limited basis  and a more extended basis in the event of a disaster 
today we are performing final test and assembly on a limited basis  in atlanta  georgia 
the implementation of such a disaster recovery plan could subject us to additional payments to the office of the chief scientist  which could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents if we have insufficient proprietary rights or if we fail to protect those rights we have  our business would be materially impaired 
we rely on third party license agreements and termination or impairment of these agreements may cause delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments which would harm our business 
we have licensing agreements with various suppliers for software incorporated into our products 
for example  we license video communications source code from adtran  ebsnet  mitsubishi  omnitel  radvision and telesoft  video algorithm protocols from ezenia and real networks  development source code from avaya  cisco systems  hughes software systems  ltd 
and philips semiconductor  audio algorithms from lucent technologies  nortel networks and texas instruments  communication software from databeam and windows software from microsoft 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the termination or impairment of these licenses could result in delays or reductions in new product introductions or current product shipments until equivalent software could be developed  licensed and integrated  if at all possible  which would harm our business and results of operations 
we rely on patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights 
others may independently develop similar proprietary information and techniques or gain access to our intellectual property rights or disclose such technology 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any patent or registered trademark owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged in the us or foreign countries or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
in addition  foreign intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity of and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could harm our business  and could ultimately be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights 
we face and might in the future face intellectual property infringement claims and other litigation claims that might be costly to resolve and  if resolved adversely  may harm our operating results or financial condition 
we are a party to lawsuits patent related and otherwise in the normal course of our business 
litigation can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
the results of complex litigation matters are difficult to predict  and the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could harm our business  financial condition and reputation 
negative developments with respect to pending lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline  and an unfavorable resolution of any particular lawsuit could have an adverse and possibly material effect on our business and results of operations 
moreover  specifically from time to time  we are involved in claims and legal proceedings that assert patent infringement claims or other intellectual property rights covering our products 
we expect that the number and significance of these matters will increase as our business expands 
in particular  we expect to face an increasing number of patent and copyright claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of video  voice  data and web conferencing products overlap 
any claims or proceedings against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  require significant amounts of management time  result in the diversion of significant operational resources  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
an unfavorable outcome in any such claim or proceeding could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs  and potentially in future periods 
further  any settlement announced by us may expose us to further claims against us 
table of contents by third parties seeking monetary or other damages which  even if unsuccessful  would divert management attention from the business and cause us to incur costs  possibly material  to defend such matters 
for example  in november  we settled our outstanding patent infringement litigation with avistar communications  inc avistar and collaboration properties  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of avistar 
and  in connection with such settlement  paid million 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section  beginning with this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
such report contains  among other matters  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
such report must also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of such internal controls 
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso provides a framework for companies to assess and improve their internal control systems 
auditing standard no 
provides the professional standards and related performance guidance for auditors to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting under section management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting requires management to make subjective judgments and  particularly because section and auditing standard no 
are newly effective  some of the judgments will be in areas that may be open to interpretation and therefore the report is uniquely difficult to prepare 
while we are now able to assert  in our management certifications filed with this annual report on form k  that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of december   we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting 
if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective for any given reporting period or if our auditors are unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we have been unable to predict accurately the costs associated with evaluating our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and may continue to be unable to do so in the future 
we have been unable to accurately predict the costs  including the costs of both internal assessments and external auditor assessments  associated with complying with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and in evaluating our internal control over financial reporting 
costs of compliance were significantly larger than originally anticipated in  and costs of compliance in future periods may continue to be unpredictable  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices  new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules  or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a 
table of contents significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business 
further  such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 
for example  we currently are not required to record stock based compensation charges to earnings in connection with stock options grants to our employees 
however  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb r  stock based payments will require us to record stock based compensation charges to earnings for employee stock option grants commencing in the third quarter of such charges will negatively impact our earnings 
we may fail to implement necessary changes to our business strategy successfully or in a timely manner 
management is continually reviewing and refining the business strategy and direction of the company 
from time to time  we may engage third party consultants to assist us with such evaluation of our business strategy or with certain aspects of our business strategy 
if management fails to appropriately recognize when changes to our business strategy are warranted  fails to effectively adjust the company s direction as warranted  or fails to implement certain recommendations made by third party consultants successfully or in a timely manner relating to our strategic direction  our results of operations may be adversely impacted  possibly materially 
business interruptions could adversely affect our operations 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  typhoon or other natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  quarantines  national catastrophe  terrorist activities  war  ongoing iraqi disturbances  an attack on israel and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a fully implemented detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our cash flow could fluctuate due to the potential difficulty of collecting our receivables and managing our inventories 
over the past few years  we initiated significant investments in europe and asia to expand our business in these regions 
in europe and asia  as with other international regions  credit terms are typically longer than in the united states 
therefore  as europe  asia and other international regions grow as a percentage of our revenues  as happened from through  accounts receivable balances will likely increase as compared to previous years 
although  from time to time  we have been able to largely offset the effects of these influences through additional incentives offered to channel partners at the end of each quarter in the form of prepaid discounts  these additional incentives have lowered our profitability 
in addition  the recurrence of economic uncertainty or downturn in technology spending in the united states may restrict the availability of capital which may delay our collections from our channel partners beyond our historical experience or may cause companies to file for bankruptcy  which occurred with global crossing  worldcom and mcsi 
either of these conditions would harm our cash flow and days sales outstanding performance 
although in recent quarters our experience in collecting receivables has been good and we expect this trend to continue  there can be no assurance that it will continue 
in  our days sales outstanding dso metrics have ranged from in the first quarter of to days in the fourth quarter of we expect that dso metrics will increase as a result of a change in our co op marketing programs and as a result of extending payment terms beyond days to remain competitive  as we did recently in north america for certain service provider and public sector customers 
additionally  dso metrics will continue to fluctuate  and in all likelihood  will increase as revenues increase  as a result of fluctuations in revenue linearity  as a result of future acquisitions  or any other factors 
in addition  as we manage our business and focus on shorter shipment lead times for certain of our products and implement freight cost reduction programs  our inventory levels may increase  resulting in decreased inventory turns that could negatively impact our cash flow 

table of contents our stock price fluctuates as a result of the conduct of our business and stock market fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business  including competitors  partners  suppliers or telecommunications industry leaders or relating to us specifically  as has occurred recently  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  technological innovations by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our results of operations  general market conditions or market conditions specific to technology industries  domestic and international macroeconomic factors  and any other factors  including those factors discussed in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other factors that may affect future operations 
in addition  the stock market continues to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many high technology companies like us 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and bank borrowings 
the investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid  high quality instruments  with the exception of the million invested in equity securities of publicly traded companies 
some investments in the portfolio may contain an embedded derivative  and interest rate hedges may be placed if they are tied to a specific investment or group of investments in accordance with our investment policy  however  they are generally not significant 
we may occasionally use forward contracts as a hedge against currency exchange rate fluctuations  which may affect the value of trade receivables billed in currencies other than the united states dollar 
as of december   we have no open foreign currency hedging contracts 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
short term and long term investments consist of us  state and municipal government obligations and foreign and domestic public corporate debt and equity securities  of which less than million was strategically invested in non transferable warrants to purchase common stock of a publicly traded company at december  these investments in non transferable warrants to purchase common stock of a publicly traded company are subject to market price fluctuations which are primarily influenced by changes in interest rates are marked to market each period by recording an unrealized gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations
