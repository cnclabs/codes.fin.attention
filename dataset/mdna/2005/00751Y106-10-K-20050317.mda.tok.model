item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under forward looking statements and risk factors elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december of each year 
our first quarter consists of weeks  and the other three quarters consist of weeks  with the exception of the fourth quarter fiscal which consisted of weeks due to our week fiscal year in introduction we primarily operate within the united states automotive aftermarket industry  which includes replacement parts excluding tires  accessories  maintenance items  batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks  vans  minivans and sport utility vehicles 
we currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items to do it yourself  or diy  customers in united states  based on store count and sales 
our operations are conducted in one operating segment 
at january   we operated  stores throughout states in the northeastern  southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
these stores operated under the advance auto parts trade name except for certain stores in the state of florida  which operated under advance discount auto parts or discount auto parts trade names 
these stores offered automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items  with no significant concentration in any specific product area 
in addition  we operated stores under the western auto trade name  located primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands  which offer automotive tires and service in addition to automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items 
the following table sets forth the number of new  closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal  and we lease approximately of our stores 
fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year   new stores closed stores number of stores  end of period    relocated stores stores with commercial delivery programs   we anticipate adding approximately to new stores during primarily through new store openings and selective acquisitions 
management overview in  we produced solid growth in our sales and earnings and ended the year with strong sales momentum during the fourth quarter 
we believe this momentum confirms that our initiatives are working and further makes us believe we are very well positioned for and beyond 
in addition  our industry dynamics continue to become more positive each year 
the average age of vehicles continues to increase and is now over nine years old 
currently  over of actively driven vehicles are at least six years old and are beginning to enter the period when parts begin to fail 
the replacement parts for these vehicles are higher due to the technological changes in recent models and the shift from cars to light trucks and sport utility vehicles 
beyond the positive fundamentals of our industry  the implementation of our initiatives remains on schedule 
our specific focus is to drive higher sales per store and thereby leverage our fixed expenses 
the initiatives for driving this sales growth include continued execution of our category management program  ongoing implementation of our store remodeling program  consistent growth and execution of our commercial delivery program  enhanced advertising and focus on serving the customer  training and development of our team members  and investing in technology and innovative store systems 
in addition  we are focused on optimizing our overall expenses at all levels of the organization as well as continuing to execute our supply chain initiatives to better optimize our distribution costs and make our logistics network operate more efficiently and more productively 
the following table highlights certain operating results and key metrics for  and fiscal year total net sales in thousands  comparable store sales growth diy comparable store sales growth difm comparable store sales growth average net sales per store in thousands   inventory per store in thousands   inventory turnover gross margins operating margins note these metrics should be reviewed along with the footnotes to the table setting forth our selected store data in item selected financial data located elsewhere in this report 
the footnotes contain descriptions regarding the calculation of these metrics 
all financial metrics for include the rd week  except the average net sales per store and inventory turnover metrics 
key events the following key events occurred during and reflect opportunities that will support our strategic initiatives discussed above our board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program during the third quarter of this program allows us to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock at prices that we believe are attractive with confidence of our ability to produce strong operating results in the future 
as of january   we had repurchased a total of million shares at an aggregate cost of million 
we entered into a vendor financing program during the first quarter of allowing us to extend our payment terms on certain merchandise purchases 
this program will allow us to leverage our working capital and utilize existing cash flow to fund our strategic initiatives and capital requirements 
during  we purchased a new northeast distribution center in pennsylvania 
this facility is planned to begin servicing our expanding store base in the northeast region of the united states during the first quarter of we completed the refinancing of our senior credit facility during the fourth quarter of our amended senior credit facility provided for an additional million for stock buybacks under our stock repurchase program 
discontinued operations prior to  we operated a second segment for our wholesale business 
on december   we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale distribution network 
the wholesale distribution network  or wholesale  consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations  for which we supplied merchandise inventory and certain services 
due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area  it had become difficult to serve these dealers effectively 
this component of our business operated in the wholesale segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit expenses of million and million for fiscal years and  represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that segment 
we have classified these operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended january  and december  to reflect this decision 
for the fiscal year ended january   the operating results related to the discontinued wholesale business were minimal as a result of recognizing an estimate of exit costs in fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates 
vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and or payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other promotional consideration 
we account for vendor incentives in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
many of the incentives are provided under long term agreements terms in excess of one year  while others are negotiated on an annual basis 
certain vendors require us to use cooperative advertising allowances exclusively for advertising 
we define these allowances as restricted cooperative advertising allowances and recognize them as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses as incremental advertising expenditures are incurred 
the remaining cooperative advertising allowances not restricted by our vendors and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and recorded as a reduction to inventory and recognized through cost of sales as the inventory is sold 
we recognize certain other promotional incentives earned under long term supply agreements as a reduction to cost of sales 
these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative purchases as a percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the agreement 
the estimate of total purchases are highly sensitive to market demand for that product and could positively or negatively impact our cost of sales if actual purchases or results from any year differ from our estimates  however  incentives earned over the life of the agreement would be the same 
incentives associated with short term agreements are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the annual agreements 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue 
management s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities 
earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in accounts receivable except for that portion expected to be received after one year  which is included in other assets 
inventory reserves we establish reserves for inventory shrink  as an increase to our cost of sales  for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program 
our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program  which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures 
we evaluate the accuracy of this program on an on going basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves 
reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are recorded as well based on current inventory levels of discontinued product and historical analysis of the liquidation of discontinued inventory below cost 
the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit 
we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost 
we develop these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors  the level of credit provided by the vendor and management s estimate of the discounts to recorded cost  if any  required by market conditions 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
warranty reserves our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims 
we are responsible for merchandise and services sold under warranty which are not covered by vendor warranties primarily batteries and roadside assistance 
we record a reserve for future warranty claims as an increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required  which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
self insured reserves we are self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure 
a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost  which we calculate using analyses of historical data  demographic and severity factors and valuations provided by third party actuaries 
management monitors new claims and claim development as well as negative trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves 
on a periodic basis  we also review our assumptions with our third party actuaries 
while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  our self insurance reserves and corresponding selling  general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
leases and leasehold improvements we lease certain store locations  distribution centers  office space  equipment and vehicles 
we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for leases and subsequent amendments which require that leases be evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
certain leases contain rent escalation clauses  which are recorded on a straight line basis over the initial term of the lease with the difference between the rent paid and the straight line rent recorded as a deferred rent liability 
lease incentive payments received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent 
in addition  leasehold improvements associated with these operating leases are amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the respective lease terms 
the term of each lease is generally the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors were to exist such that renewals potentially provided for in the lease are reasonably assured to be exercised 
in those instances the renewal period would be included in the lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease 
closed store liabilities we recognize a reserve for future obligations at the time we close a leased store location 
the reserve includes the present value of the remaining lease obligations and management s estimate of future costs for common area maintenance and taxes  offset by the present value of management s estimate of potential subleases and lease buyouts 
these estimates are based on current market conditions and our experience of obtaining subleases or buyouts on similar properties 
however  our inability to enter into the subleases or obtain buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate markets for these properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases or decreases to these reserves and could impact our selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows 
components of statement of operations net sales net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales  new store net sales  service sales offered only in the western auto retail locations and finance charges on installment sales 
we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting once a store has been opened for complete accounting periods 
we include relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
we exclude net sales from the western auto retail stores from our comparable store sales as a result of their unique product offerings  including automotive service and tires 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december and consists of or weeks 
our fiscal year began on january  and consisted of weeks  while our fiscal year began on december  and consisted of weeks 
the extra week of operations in fiscal results in our fiscal consisting of non comparable calendar weeks to fiscal to create a meaningful comparable store sales measure for fiscal  we have compared the calendar weeks of to the corresponding calendar weeks of fiscal accordingly  our calculation of comparable stores sales for fiscal excludes week one of operations from fiscal cost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  net of incentives under vendor programs  inventory shrinkage and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix  price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs 
we seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll  store occupancy including rent  net advertising expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of corporate team members  administrative office expenses  data processing  professional expenses and other related expenses including expenses associated with merger and integration 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended january  january  december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses expenses associated with merger and integration expenses associated with merger related restructuring operating income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt expenses associated with secondary offering other income  net income tax expense income from continuing operations before discontinued operations discontinued operations loss income from operations of discontinued wholesale distribution network benefit provision for income taxes loss income on discontinued operations net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for were  million  an increase of million  or  over net sales for excluding the effect of the rd week for our net sales increased million  or  over net sales for the net sales increase was due to an increase in the comparable store sales of and contributions from our new stores opened within the last year 
the comparable store sales increase was driven by increases in both customer traffic and average ticket sales 
overall  we believe our store format  category management and enhanced nationwide advertising program drove our growth in net sales 
in addition  we believe our difm sales have increased as a result of the continued execution of our commercial delivery programs in our existing markets and our continued focus on a high level of service to our difm customers 
gross profit for was  million  or of net sales  as compared to  million  or of net sales  in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and reduced inventory shrinkage 
in  we anticipate our gross profit to continue to improve as a result of the benefits realized from our category management initiatives  including the expansion of our private label brand and proprietary brands  and the continued execution of our supply chain initiatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  million  or of net sales for  from  million  or of net sales for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in was primarily a result of increased expenses associated with our self insurance programs  including the increased costs required to close claims below our stop loss limits and increased medical costs for covered team members due to inflation in the health care sector 
selling  general and administrative expenses for included million in merger and integration expenses related to the integration of discount 
these integration expenses were related to  among other things  overlapping administrative functions and store conversion expenses 
excluding the merger and integration expenses from  selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales 
interest expense for was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall interest rates resulting primarily from our redemption of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  the decrease is a result of lower average outstanding debt levels on our senior credit facility throughout fiscal as compared to fiscal income tax expense for was million  as compared to million for this increase in income tax expense primarily reflects our higher earnings 
our effective income tax rate was for both and we recorded net income of million  per diluted share for  as compared to million  or per diluted share for as a percentage of sales  net income for was  as compared to for our net income for included the effect of expenses associated with merger and integration and loss on extinguishment of debt of million  or per diluted share

increases in both our diy and difm business contributed to the comparable store sales increase 
gross profit for was  million  or of net sales  as compared to  million  or of net sales  in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and improved efficiencies in our logistics network 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including merger and integration costs of million in  increased to  million  or of net sales for  from  million  or of net sales for in  merger and integration costs were million 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily a result of a decrease in merger and integration expenses related to the integration of discount 
these integration expenses are related to  among other things  overlapping administrative functions and store conversion expenses 
the decline in merger and integration costs was anticipated as we approached the completion of the discount integration 
excluding the impact of the merger and integration costs  the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is a result of leveraging our fixed costs as a result of the impact of the rd week of operations in the fourth quarter of interest expense for was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall interest rates resulting primarily from our redemption of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in first quarter additionally  the decrease is a result of overall lower debt levels in as compared to income tax expense for was million  as compared to million for our effective income tax rate decreased to for  as compared to  for the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in pre tax income  which reduced the impact of certain permanent differences on the effective rate 
during  we recorded million in a loss on extinguishment of debt 
this loss reflects the write off of deferred loan costs and premiums paid to redeem our senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures during the first quarter of fiscal  and also includes the related financing costs associated with amending our senior credit facility to finance this redemption 
additionally  this loss includes the ratable portion of deferred loans costs associated with the partial repayment of our term loans during fiscal we recorded net income of million  per diluted share for  as compared to million  or per diluted share for as a percentage of sales  net income for was  as compared to for the effect of the expenses associated with merger and integration and loss on extinguishment of debt on net income was million  or per diluted share for and million  or per diluted share for these per share amounts reflect the two for one stock split declared in quarterly financial results unaudited in thousands  except per share data weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended net sales      gross profit      net income      net income per share basic diluted liquidity and capital resources overview of liquidity our primary cash requirements include the purchase of inventory  capital expenditures  repurchasing shares under our stock repurchase program and contractual obligations 
we have financed these requirements primarily through a combination of cash generated from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
at january   our cash balance was million  an increase of million compared to our cash balance increased primarily due to our increased earnings in  as well as a decrease in cash used to repay or redeem indebtedness compared to in  we used available funds combined with borrowings under our senior credit facility to redeem our senior discount debentures and senior subordinated notes 
at january   we had outstanding indebtedness consisting of borrowings of million under our senior credit facility  an increase of million from additionally  we had million in letters of credit outstanding  which reduced our availability under the revolving credit facility to million 
our availability under our revolving credit facility increased by million from at the end of fiscal due to the increase in our revolving credit facility from million to million 
this increase resulted from the refinancing of our senior credit facility  which gives us additional funds for our primary cash requirements 
capital expenditures our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program  including new store openings and store acquisitions  store relocations and remodels  inventory requirements  the construction and upgrading of distribution centers  the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our strategic acquisitions 
our capital expenditures were million in these amounts included costs of million for the construction and preparation of our northeastern distribution center and additional amounts related to new store openings  the upgrade of our information systems  remodels and relocations of existing stores  including our continued physical conversion of stores acquired in the discount acquisition to our advance auto parts store format 
in  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million to million 
our new stores  if leased  require capital expenditures of approximately  per store and an inventory investment of approximately  per store  net of vendor payables 
a portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility 
pre opening expenses  consisting primarily of store set up costs and training of new store team members  average approximately  per store and are expensed when incurred 
our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open or acquire and the timing of those openings or acquisitions within a given year 
we opened new stores each year during and we anticipate adding approximately to new stores during primarily through new store openings and selective acquisitions 
vendor financing program historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth  and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a short term financing program with a bank  allowing us to extend our payment terms on certain merchandise purchases 
under this program  we issue negotiable instruments to our vendors in lieu of a cash payment 
each vendor is able to present the instrument to the bank for payment at an agreed upon discount rate 
at january   million was payable to the bank by us under this program 
this program will allow us to further reduce our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory growth 
additionally  our new senior credit facility allows us to increase our capacity under this program from million to million during stock repurchase program during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock plus related expenses 
the program will allow us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions form time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
as of january   we had repurchased a total of million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million  or per share 
at january   we had million  excluding related expenses  available for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program 
as of march   we had repurchased an additional million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
deferred compensation and postretirement plans we maintain two deferred compensation plans 
our ongoing plan was established in as an unqualified deferred compensation plan established for certain of our key team members 
this plan provides for a mimimum and maximum deferral percentage of the team member base salary and bonus  as determined by our retirement plan committee 
we fund the plan liability by remitting the team members deferral to a rabbi trust where these deferrals are invested in trading securities 
accordingly  all gains and losses on these underlying investments are held in the rabbi trust to fund the deferred compensation liability 
at january   the liability related to this plan was million  all of which is current 
we also maintain an unfunded deferred compensation plan established prior to the western merger for certain key team members of western 
the plan was frozen at the date of the western merger 
at january   the total liability for the western plan was million  of which million is recorded as a current liability 
the classification for the western deferred compensation plan is determined by payment terms elected by plan participants  which can be changed upon months notice 
we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members through our postretirement plan 
at january   our accrued benefit cost related to this plan was million 
the plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paid incurred 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining our postretirement benefit obligation is actuarially determined 
the discount rate utilized at january  and january  was and  respectively 
we reserve the right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions at any time 
we also continue to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these benefits and control costs 
any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual expense 
effective second quarter of  we amended the plan to exclude outpatient prescription drug benefits to medicare eligible retirees effective january  due to this negative plan amendment  our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by million  resulting in an unrecognized negative prior service cost in the same amount 
the unrecognized negative prior service cost is being amortized over the estimated remaining life expectancy of the plan participants of years 
analysis of cash flows fiscal year in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million 
significant components of this decrease consisted of a million increase in earnings from fiscal  a million reduction in deferred income tax provision  primarily reflective of the reduction in operating loss carryforwards from prior years and the impact of the loss on extinguishment of debt from fiscal a million increase in inventory growth  and a million decrease in cash flow from accounts payable  excluding the impact of our vendor financing program which began in fiscal for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million

contractual obligations our future contractual obligations related to long term debt and operating leases at january  were as follows contractual obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter in thousands long term debt     operating leases     other long term liabilities  we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements 
primarily includes employee benefits accruals  restructuring and closed store liabilities and deferred income taxes for which no contractual payment schedule exists 
long term debt senior credit facility 
on november   we entered into a new amended and restated million senior credit facility 
the new senior facility provides for a million tranche a term loan and a million tranche b term loan 
proceeds from these term loans were used to refinance our tranche d and e term loans and revolver under our previous facility 
additionally  the new senior credit facility provides for a million delayed draw term loan  which is available exclusively for stock buybacks under our stock repurchase program  and a million revolving facility  or the revolver which provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of million 
in conjunction with this refinancing  we wrote off deferred financing costs related to the previous term loans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
the write off of these costs combined with additional costs required to establish the new facility resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended january  earlier during fiscal  we made million of repayments on our previous senior credit facility prior to their scheduled maturity 
in conjunction with these partial repayments  we wrote off million  which is also classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january at january   our senior credit facility consisted of a tranche a term loan facility with a balance of million  a tranche b term loan facility with a balance of million  a delayed draw term loan with a balance of million and a million revolving credit facility including a letter of credit sub facility of which million was available as a result of million in letters of credit outstanding 
the senior credit facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries including discount and its subsidiaries and is secured by all of our assets and the assets of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries including discount and its subsidiaries 
the tranche a term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of million on march  and quarterly thereafter through december   million on march  and quarterly thereafter through december   million on march  and quarterly thereafter through june  and million due at maturity on september  the tranche b term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of million on march  and quarterly thereafter  with a final payment of million due at maturity on september  the delayed draw term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on march  and quarterly thereafter  with a final payment due at maturity on september  the revolver expires on september  the interest rates on the tranche a and b term loans  the delayed draw term loan and the revolver are based  at our option  on an adjusted libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
the initial margin for the tranche a term loan and revolver is and per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings  respectively 
the initial margin for the tranche b term loan and the delayed draw term loan is and per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings  respectively 
additionally  a commitment fee of per annum is charged on the unused portion of the tranche a term loan and revolver  payable in arrears 
a commitment fee of per annum is charged on the unused portion of the delayed draw term loan  payable in arrears 
as of january   we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding on an aggregate of million of debt under our credit facility 
the first swap allows us to fix our libor rate at on million of variable rate debt 
the first swap has a term of months and expires in the first quarter of fiscal the second swap allows us to fix our libor rate at on million of variable rate debt 
the second swap has a term of months and expires in the first quarter of fiscal subsequent to january  and in an effort to manage our future interest rate risk  we entered into the following three new interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of million of debt under our senior credit facility the first swap  beginning in march  allows us to fix our total interest rate at on million of our debt for a term of months  the second swap  beginning in march  allows us to fix our total interest rate at on million of our debt for a term of months  and the third swap  beginning in march  allows us to fix our total interest rate at on million of our debt for a term of months 
the senior credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all  subject to certain exceptions  of our assets and the assets of our existing domestic subsidiaries and will be secured by the properties and assets of our future domestic subsidiaries 
the senior credit facility contains covenants restricting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to  among other things  declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  prepay  redeem or purchase debt  incur liens or engage in sale leaseback transactions  make loans and investments  incur additional debt including hedging arrangements  engage in certain mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  engage in transactions with affiliates  change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries and change our passive holding company status 
we are also required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio  a minimum current assets to funded senior debt ratio  a maximum senior leverage ratio and limits on capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with the above covenants at january  credit ratings at january   we had a credit rating on our senior credit facility from standard poor s of bb and a credit rating of ba from moody s investor service 
the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rates under our senior credit facility is based on such credit ratings 
if these credit ratings decline  our interest expense may increase 
conversely  if these credit ratings increase  our interest expense may decrease 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months 
in addition  our business can be affected by weather conditions 
while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods  extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail

this eitf addresses whether a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor that is a reimbursement by the vendor for honoring the vendor s sales incentives offered directly to consumers in accordance with the guidance in eitf issue no 
for purposes of this issue  the vendor s sales incentive offered directly to consumers is limited to a vendor s incentive i that can be tendered by a consumer at resellers that accept manufacturer s incentives in partial or full of the price charged by the reseller for the vendor s product  ii for which the reseller receives a direct reimbursement from the vendor or a clearinghouse authorized by the vendor based on the face amount of the incentive  iii for which the terms of reimbursement to the reseller for the vendor s sales incentive offered to the consumer must not be influenced by or negotiated in conjunction with any other incentive arrangements between the vendor and the reseller but  rather may only be determined by the terms of the incentive offered to consumers and iv whereby the reseller is subject to an agency relationship with the vendor  whether expressed or implied  in the sales incentive transaction between the vendor and the consumer 
the consensus is that sales incentives that meet all of such criteria are not subject to the guidance in issue no 
the release is effective for fiscal periods beginning after november  we adopted this release during the first quarter of fiscal with no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp   accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp addresses the appropriate accounting and disclosure requirements for companies that sponsor a postretirement health care plan that provides prescription drug benefits 
the new guidance was deemed necessary as a result of the medicare prescription law which includes a federal subsidy for qualifying companies 
the effective date of fsp is the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we completed a negative plan amendment to eliminate outpatient prescription drug benefits from our postretirement plan effective in the second quarter of fiscal  therefore  the adoption of fsp had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or related footnote disclosure 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and subsequently issued stock option related guidance 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
we are required to apply sfas no 
r to all awards granted  modified or settled as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are also required to use either the modified prospective method or modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  we must recognize compensation cost for all awards subsequent to adopting the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding upon adoption 
under the modified retrospective method  we must restate our previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts we previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis  as if the prior standard had been adopted 
under both methods  we are permitted to use either the straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting 
the standard permits and encourages early adoption 
we have commenced our analysis of the impact of sfas no 
r  but have not yet decided whether we elect to early adopt  if we elect to early adopt  what date we would do so  whether we will use the modified prospective or modified retrospective method  and whether we will elect to use straight line or an accelerated method 
accordingly  we have not determined the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors risks relating to our business we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  including increasing comparable store sales  enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales  enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow 
if these initiatives are unsuccessful  or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 
adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy general economic conditions and conditions in our local markets  which could reduce our sales  the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices or increase spending  the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry  such as consolidation  which may disrupt or sever one or more of our vendor relationships  our ability to anticipate and meet changes in consumer preferences for automotive products  accessories and services in a timely manner  and our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  which depends in part on the types of recruiting  training and benefit programs we adopt 
we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful 
we have increased our store count significantly from  stores at the end of to  stores at january  we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy  primarily by opening new stores 
there can be no assurance that the implementation of this strategy will be successful 
the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things our ability to manage the expansion and hire  train and retain qualified sales associates  the availability of potential store locations in highly visible  well trafficked areas  and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms for new locations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales 
the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise  market and price the products required in their respective markets 
furthermore  we may acquire or try to acquire stores or businesses from  make investments in  or enter into strategic alliances with  companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence 
any future acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks  including the difficulty of identifying appropriate acquisition candidates  the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the respective entities  the potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management s attention  the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of relationships with team members and customers as a result of changes in management 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts 
if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for a number of reasons  including the weather  as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement weather  the economy  as during periods of good economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own cars 
in periods of declining economic conditions  both diy and difm customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  and the decline of the average age of vehicles  miles driven or number of cars on the road may indicate a reduction in the demand for our product offerings 
if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
we depend on the services of many qualified team members and may not be able to attract and retain such qualified team members 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our many team members 
at march   we employed  team members 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current qualified team members as well as attract and retain additional qualified team members as needed in the future 
our ability to maintain an adequate level of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package 
if we fail to maintain such an adequate compensation and benefits package  our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas  including price  name recognition  customer service and location 
we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry  and primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains  wholesalers or jobber stores  independent operators  automobile dealers that supply parts  discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products 
these competitors and the level of competition vary by market 
some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share  including a greater amount of marketing activities  a larger number of stores  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger and more established customer bases 
our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices or increase our spending  which would lower revenue and profitability 
competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies 
if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors operations could increase our cost of goods sold 
our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and on other terms 
many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms 
for example  financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them 
in addition  the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors  and could lead to less competition and  consequently  higher prices 
because we are involved in litigation from time to time  and are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations  we could incur substantial judgments  fines  legal fees and other costs 
we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers  employees or other third parties for various actions 
in particular  we are currently involved in litigation involving claims relating to  among other things  breach of contract  tortious conduct  employment discrimination  asbestos exposure and product defects 
the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial 
although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims  if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim  it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 
additionally  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to employment matters  environmental protection and building and zoning requirements 
if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions 
in addition  our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these or future laws or regulations 
risks relating to our financial condition the covenants governing our senior credit facility impose significant restrictions on us 
the terms of our senior credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests 
these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions  including incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness  paying dividends or making distributions or certain other restricted payments  making capital expenditures and other investments  creating liens on our assets  issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries  transferring or selling assets currently held by us  repurchasing stock and certain indebtedness  engaging in transactions with affiliates  entering into any agreements that restrict dividends from our subsidiaries  and engaging in mergers or consolidations 
the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our senior credit facility 
furthermore  our senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including establishing a maximum leverage ratio and requiring us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a funded senior debt to current assets ratio  which  if not maintained by us  will cause us to be in default under our senior credit facility 
any of these defaults  if not waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debt  in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable 
if this occurs  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if new financing were available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
our ability to service our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our operations may not generate the amount of cash we need 
we will need a significant amount of cash to service our debt 
our ability to generate cash depends on our successful financial and operating performance 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations 
our financial and operational performance also depends upon a number of other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include economic and competitive conditions in the automotive aftermarket industry  and operating difficulties  operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience 
if we are unable to service our debt  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our debt or raising additional equity capital 
however  we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate 
also  some alternative strategies would require the consent of at least a majority in interest of the lenders under our senior credit facility and we can provide no assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent 
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and alternative strategies are unsuccessful or unavailable  our lenders would be entitled to exercise various remedies  including foreclosing on our assets 
under those circumstances  our investors may lose all or a portion of their investments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long term debt 
our long term debt currently consists of borrowings under a senior credit facility and is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt  exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of hedging activities 
our future exposure to interest rate risk increased during due to the expiration of our million zero cost collar during november in march  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of million of our debt under our credit facility 
the first swap allows us to fix our libor rate at on million of variable rate debt for a term of months  expiring in the first quarter of fiscal the second swap allows us to fix our libor rate at on million of variable rate debt for a term of months  expiring in the first quarter of fiscal subsequent to january  and in an effort to manage our future interest rate risk  we entered into the following three new interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of million of debt under our senior credit facility 
the detail for the individual swaps is as follows the first swap  beginning in march  allows us to fix our total interest rate at on million of our debt for a term of months  the second swap  beginning in march  allows us to fix our total interest rate at on million of our debt for a term of months  and the third swap  beginning in march  allows us to fix our total interest rate at on million of our debt for a term of months 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on our long term debt outstanding at january   by expected maturity dates 
additionally  the table includes the notional amounts of our debt hedged and the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our interest rate swaps through their maturity dates 
expected maturity dates approximate contract terms 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at january   as adjusted by the limitations of the swap agreement 
the impact of our three interest rate swap agreements entered into in march are not reflected in the table below
