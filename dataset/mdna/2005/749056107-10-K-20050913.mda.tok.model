item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview quixote corporation the company and its subsidiaries develop  manufacture and market highway and transportation safety products to protect  direct and inform motorists  pedestrians and road workers in both domestic and international markets 
the company s operations are comprised of two reportable segments within the highway and transportation safety industry  concentrating on safety problems and designing products to provide transportation safety solutions 
the company s two reportable segments are the manufacture and sale of highway and transportation safety products which protect and direct  and the manufacture and sale of products and services which inform that are often referred to as intelligent transportation systems its products 
the company s protect and direct segment provides solutions for improving safety on the roads either by minimizing the severity of crashes that occur or by preventing crashes from occurring by directing or guiding traffic 
the primary product lines within the protect and direct segment include energy absorbing products such as crash cushions  truck mounted attenuators  sand filled barrels and water filled barriers  and directing and guiding products such as flexible post delineators and glare screen systems 
the company s inform segment provides solutions for improving traffic flow and safety on roads and runways by providing information 
the primary product lines within the inform segment include intelligent intersection control systems  automated enforcement systems  video detection systems  mobile and permanent variable message signs  advanced sensing products which measure distance  count and classify vehicles  and sense weather conditions  computerized highway advisory radio transmitting systems  automated red light enforcement systems  and other transportation equipment 
the company s products are sold by both a direct sales force and a distribution network to customers in the highway construction and safety business  state departments of transportation  county and local governments and other governmental transportation agencies 
the domestic market for highway and transportation safety products is directly affected by federal  state and local governmental policies 
a large portion of the company s sales is ultimately financed by funds provided to the states by the federal government 
historically  these funds have covered to of the cost of highway safety projects on roads constructed or maintained with federal assistance 
the company s business is seasonal with a higher level of sales and earnings in the company s fourth fiscal quarter 
results of operations the financial results for fiscal were below our expectations  largely as a result of federal funding issues and state and local budgetary constraints 
we believe that the long delay in the passage of the federal transportation funding legislation  safetea lu which was passed by congress in july and signed by the president in august  adversely impacted spending on products offered by the company  and therefore adversely affected our financial performance 
in addition  many state and local governments reduced spending on transportation safety due to budgetary constraints  given both national and local economies 
see future outlook for further information

the net sales of the company s other product lines decreased by due to decreases in sales volume across both its protect and direct and inform segments in fiscal geographic international sales for fiscal increased by  or  to  compared to  for fiscal  primarily due to increases in the protect and direct segment  where international sales increased to  the increase in international sales in the protect and direct segment was due to both sales increases in established markets and to sales to customers in countries which had not previously purchased those products from the protect and direct segment 
international sales in the inform segment increased to  in part due to the acquisition of peek traffic in fiscal domestic sales for fiscal decreased to  from  due primarily to decreased sales of traffic control systems and products further described below

the domestic sales of the company s other product lines decreased as further described below 
protect and direct net sales for the company s protect and direct segment for fiscal increased slightly to  from  for fiscal due to strong international sales growth  as stated above 
domestic sales decreased by 
the company believes that the decrease in domestic sales volume was due to state budgetary constraints and transportation funding uncertainties caused by the continued delay in the passage of the new federal highway funding bill 
increased sales of permanent crash cushions and triton barrier products were largely offset by decreased sales of truck mounted attenuators  sand filled barrels  delineator products and parts 
sales of permanent crash cushions increased  sales of tma products decreased  and sales of parts decreased 
net sales for the company s protect and direct segment for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal the company believed the decrease in sales was due to state budgetary constraints and transportation funding uncertainties caused by the delay in the passage of the new federal highway funding bill 
decreased sales of permanent crash cushions  truck mounted attenuator tma products  and barrels were partially offset by increased sales of parts 
sales of permanent crash cushions decreased  sales of tma products decreased  and sales of parts increased 
inform net sales for the company s inform segment for fiscal decreased  to  from  for fiscal the acquisition of peek traffic  effective december  contributed net sales of  during the year from the period july  and november  not comparable to the prior period 
the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower sales volume of traffic control systems and highway advisory radio products 
sales of traffic control products continue to be affected by ongoing state and municipal budgetary issues  which has resulted in depressed order flows and sales levels significantly lower than planned 
net sales for the company s inform segment for fiscal increased  to  from  for fiscal this was primarily due to the acquisitions of ust and peek traffic  which added  in net sales of traffic control systems and products for net sales for the company s other inform product lines decreased due to lower sales of advanced sensing equipment and weather systems 
sales for fiscal included two particularly large contracts totaling  for weather and traffic sensing stations to ohio and variable message signs to california 
ust was affected by ongoing state and municipal budgetary issues  which resulted in depressed order flows and sales levels significantly lower than planned 
gross profit margin the company s gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal as higher gross margins for the inform segment were largely offset by lower gross profit margins in the protect and direct segment due to increased raw material costs  particularly steel costs which were not entirely passed along to customers 
the gross margin for the inform segment increased modestly due to favorable sales mix 
the gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal due principally to lower gross profit margins at ust and peek traffic 
the gross profit margin for the protect and direct segment decreased somewhat due to volume inefficiencies associated with the lower level of sales offset by a positive change in product sales mix with decreased sales of the lower margin tma product line 
the gross profit margin for the inform segment decreased primarily due to low gross profit margins for the traffic control products sold by ust and peek traffic as those gross profit margins are less than the segment s historical gross profit margin 
in addition  the gross profit margin at ust was lower than planned due to decreased sales volumes 
the gross profit margin for the other inform product lines in fiscal was slightly lower than fiscal primarily due to volume inefficiencies associated with the lower level of sales volume 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or  to  from  for fiscal expenses increased due to the inclusion of  of peek traffic expenses for fiscal  which added  for the period from july  to november  not comparable to the prior year  increased expenses relating to sarbanes oxley compliance and employee related expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for fiscal compared to for primarily due to the decline in sales and the company s primarily fixed cost structure 
selling and administrative expenses increased  or  to  from  for fiscal due to the inclusion of the traffic control business  ust and peek traffic  which added  for fiscal  not comparable to fiscal selling and administrative expenses for the other businesses decreased in fiscal primarily related to decreased selling expenses due to lower sales volume in the protect and direct segment and other businesses within the inform segment 
selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to for fiscal compared to for as ust and peek traffic have lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales than the company s historical percentage 
asset impairment charges in fiscal  the prolonged delay in the passage of new federal transportation funding legislation as well as ongoing state and municipal budget issues had a significant negative impact on the company as a whole 
in addition  ust operating results were much lower than expected  although the company was pursuing the integration of ust and peek traffic in order to improve profitability 
as a result of these factors and the company s impairment review in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the carrying amounts of certain long lived assets were no longer recoverable based on estimated future cash flows to be generated by those assets  which were lower than previously projected 
the company recorded asset impairment charges in the inform segment for fiscal of  or  net of income tax benefits  or per diluted share 
the charges within the inform segment included  relating to goodwill   for intangible assets and  for fixed assets 
gain on sale of fixed assets the company recorded a gain of  in fiscal due to the sale of certain machinery and equipment of a captive manufacturer of the protect and direct segment and received proceeds of  the company also received proceeds of  from the sale of land and recorded a gain on that sale of  for the protect and direct segment in the second quarter of fiscal which was reclassified from other income during the fourth quarter 
research and development research and development expenditures were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase of  was due primarily to increased expenditures related to traffic control products  to enhance and upgrade their product suite  and to increased expenditures in the protect and direct segment as they develop new products and application extensions to existing products 
research and development expenditures were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase of  was due primarily to the inclusion of research and development expenditures for ust and peek traffic 
the company continued to invest in development projects for new applications as well as upgrades and modifications to existing products

the weighted average rate was as of june  compared to a weighted average rate of as of june  the interest rate on the company s convertible debt issued during fiscal is 
the company expects the average interest rate paid during fiscal on all debt to be approximately 
interest expense for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal the increase was due to the higher level of average long term debt since the acquisitions of ust in may and peek traffic in december the interest rate on the company s collateralized credit agreement is based on prime or libor and a fixed rate  plus a margin 
the weighted average rate was as of june  compared to a weighted average rate of as of june  provision for income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal was  reflecting a effective tax rate 
the company expects to provide for income taxes at a rate of for fiscal the income tax benefit for fiscal was  which included  relating to the asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter and a  income tax benefit related to the favorable settlement of a tax audit recorded during the third quarter 
excluding the impact of these benefits  income taxes reflected a effective income tax rate for fiscal as compared to the effective income tax rate of for fiscal net earnings loss the net loss for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share  for included in the net loss for fiscal were the asset impairment charges of  net of taxes  or per diluted share 
the net loss for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of  or per diluted share  for included in the net loss for fiscal are the asset impairment charges of  net of taxes  or per diluted share 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings from banks and other sources 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of  as of june  during february  the company sold  of convertible senior subordinated notes due february  in a private placement and received net proceeds of  the net proceeds were used to pay off the company s bank term loan and reduce the amount of its revolving credit agreement 
the conversion price is per share  which represented a premium over the closing price of the company s stock on the close of the transaction 
if fully converted  the notes would convert into approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
the shares are not included in earnings per share as they are currently anti dilutive until earnings per share reach approximately per share 
the notes are fully redeemable by the company at any time after february  at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the investors may require the company to repurchase the notes in cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on february   or subsequently  the company entered into a new secured credit agreement during february with one bank which currently expires on february  the company believes that this collateralized credit agreement is an important source of liquidity 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility  with a million subfacility for letters of credit issued by the bank or its affiliates 
the revolving credit availability is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory  machinery and equipment and real estate  subject to a minimum excess collateral availability factor 
effective june   the company will also be required to maintain a maximum senior leverage ratio 
the covenants also limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  acquisitions  liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the borrowing is secured by a first security interest in all existing and hereafter acquired assets of the company  including accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  real estate and the equity securities of the company s subsidiaries 
under certain conditions  the company may request a release of all security interests after june   at which time the company would no longer be subject to a borrowing base formula  but would be subject to several financial covenants 
the agreement may be renewed for one additional year on each anniversary date upon mutual consent of the company and the bank 
the company s outstanding borrowings were  or of total capitalization  as of june   of which  was outstanding related to the bank credit facility 
this compares to  or of total capitalization  as of june  cash flows cash flows provided by operations were  during fiscal this compares with  in fiscal and  in fiscal in each of the past three years  cash flow from operations was primarily derived from earnings before non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization and asset impairment charges 
the decrease in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal is primarily due to the lower net earnings excluding non cash expenses in fiscal investing activities used cash of  during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal expenditures during fiscal included  for capital expenditures  which were partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of assets 
financing activities used cash of  during fiscal  compared to cash provided of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the company sold  of convertible senior subordinated notes in february and received net proceeds of  the proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to pay off the term loan under the company s credit agreement and pay down the revolving credit facility 
the company paid a net  on the company s outstanding revolving credit facility   against the remaining balance of the term loan and  on other notes payable 
the company s interest rate swap arrangement was liquidated in the third quarter of fiscal and the company received cash of  the company also received cash of  from the exercise of common stock options 
the payment of the company s semi annual cash dividend used cash of  for  the company anticipates needing  in cash for capital expenditures 
the company may also need additional cash as it considers acquiring businesses that complement its existing operations 
the company may require additional investments in working capital to maintain growth 
the company may also need additional funds to repurchase its own common stock from time to time 
these expenditures will be financed either through the company s cash on hand  cash generated from its operations or from borrowings available under the company s bank credit facility 
the company currently expects cash generated from operations to be higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal however  due to factors disclosed in future outlook below in this report  there can be no assurance that this will occur  or to what extent this will occur 
the company believes its existing cash  cash generated from operations and funds available under its existing credit facility are sufficient for all planned operating and capital requirements in the near term 
if needed and available on favorable terms  the company may also enter into other debt or equity financing arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company is subject to certain debt obligations  guarantees  commitments and contingent liabilities further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the company s contractual obligations to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  as of june  total less than year years years more than years dollar amounts in thousands long term debt note operating leases note minimum royalty payments note total as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has entered into bid and performance related bonds associated with various contracts 
potential payments due under these bonds are related to the company s performance under the applicable contract 
the total amount of bid and performance related bonds that were available and undrawn as of june  was  the company also has standby letters of credit covering potential workers compensation liabilities 
the total standby exposure relating to letters of credit as of june  was  future outlook we believe that the enactment of the federal transportation funding legislation  safetea lu  in august will improve prospects for increased spending for our products in fiscal due to the long sales cycle typical of our business  we do not expect to begin to realize the benefit of this legislation until the second half of fiscal state and local governments may be able to increase spending on transportation safety in  and therefore increase the domestic demand for our products  as both the national and local economies improve 
international sales represented of the company s total revenues in fiscal which increased from in fiscal we expect international sales to continue to be a strong driver of our sales growth 
however  there can be no assurance either domestic or international sales will increase and we remain cautious about our performance in fiscal although the company generally performed below historic levels in fiscal due to the federal funding issues and state and local budgetary constraints described above  revenues for our inform segment declined substantially more than those of the protect and direct segment 
we expect the substandard sales volumes and operating losses at the traffic control business to continue during the first half of fiscal if sales for the inform segment increase by at least million above the fiscal level  we expect to record a slight profit for the inform segment in fiscal however  there can be no assurance either that we will achieve that level of sales or that the gross margin on those sales will be sufficient to produce a profit 
we historically experience fluctuation in our gross profit margin from quarter to quarter primarily due to sales volume related to seasonality  variability in product mix and changes in our competitive environment 
in addition  we have acquired complementary businesses over the past several years and  as part of our strategy  may continue to acquire complementary businesses 
the gross profit margins of certain acquired product lines  primarily the traffic control product lines  are lower than our historical gross profit margin  which is currently adversely affecting our gross profit margin 
we also experience rigorous price competition in our variable message sign and weather sensing system product lines 
we do not believe these trends will improve in the near future 
significant accounting policies and critical estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management s estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  certain normal and recurring estimates are made including estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation reserves  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and health care liabilities 
these estimates are made using management s best judgment given relevant factors and available data 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
note to the company s june  consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies  methods and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
there have been no material changes in accounting policies  methods and estimates used by management 
in the opinion of management  the company does not have any individual accounting policy or use any individual estimate that is critical to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in most instances  the company must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 
the company believes the following significant accounting policies and methods used by the company are the most important to the presentation of the company s financial statements revenue recognition revenues  net of discounts and allowances  are recognized when either services have been rendered or both title and risk of loss of products have been transferred to unaffiliated customers 
additionally  the company ensures that collection of the resulting receivable is probable  persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  and the revenue is fixed or determinable 
provision for estimated uncollectible amounts and credit memos is made based upon management s analysis of bad debts and credit memos 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
actual costs are used to value raw materials and supplies 
standard costs  which approximate actual costs  are used to value finished goods and work in process 
standard costs include raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels  ages and salability 
long lived assets long lived assets include such items as goodwill  patents  product rights  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  the company assesses the possibility of obsolescence  demand  new technology  competition  and other pertinent economic factors and trends that may have an impact on the value or remaining lives of these assets 
amortized long lived assets including amortized intangible assets and property  plant and equipment held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in relation to future undiscounted cash flows of underlying asset groups 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
fair values of amortized long lived assets are determined based upon the performance of a third party fair value appraisal 
patents and other finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or systematic method over the life of the patent or intangible asset 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually 
the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value in a one step analysis 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level and is a two step analysis 
first  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  the company performs a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting unit s fair value to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
fair values are determined with the help of a third party appraisal firm using present value techniques 
the company s annual impairment review resulted in no impairment charges for fiscal years and as discussed further in note to the company s june  consolidated financial statements  as a result of the company s impairment review during fiscal  the company recorded non cash asset impairment charges of  relating to goodwill  other indefinite lived intangible assets and amortized long lived assets of the inform segment 
the impairment review is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on the amount of any impairment charge recorded 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow methods and are dependent upon assumptions of future sales trends  market conditions and cash flows of each reporting unit over several years 
actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted 
other significant assumptions include growth rates and the discount rate applicable to future cash flows 
the impact of these estimates and assumptions on impairment testing of goodwill is particularly critical for the company s inform segment with  of the company s  of goodwill recorded in the company s june  balance sheet 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to the extent that any future tax benefits are not expected to be fully realized  such future tax benefits are reduced by a valuation allowance 
realization of deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income so that the assets will be realized 
the factors that the company considers in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
the company expects the deferred tax assets currently recorded to be fully realizable  however  there can be no assurance that an increased valuation allowance would not need to be recorded in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates on its revolving credit agreement 
the exposure to interest rate fluctuations was significantly reduced in the third quarter of fiscal when the company issued convertible debt and used the proceeds to pay down the debt issued pursuant to the revolving credit agreement 
due to the lower exposure to rate fluctuations  the use of derivative instruments in the form of non trading interest rate swaps to manage the risk has been discontinued 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the amount of long term debt outstanding as of june  and was  and  respectively 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have adversely affected the company s and net earnings and cash flows by approximately  and  respectively 
the majority of the company s business is transacted in us dollars and the us dollar is considered the primary currency for the majority of the company s operations 
although the company continues to evaluate derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes  the company did not hold such derivatives during or assets  liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies for transaction purposes are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
however  there were no significant transaction gains or losses during  or and the company does not believe it is currently exposed to any material risk of loss from currency exchange fluctuations
