item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
these forward looking statements fall within the meaning of the federal securities laws that relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  can  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition and elsewhere in this report 
executive summary we are a leader in the application of directed molecular evolution  a process by which genes and related proteins are modified for specific commercial uses 
maxygen began operations in march with the mission to develop important commercial products through the use of biotechnology 
since then  we have established a focus in human therapeutics  particularly optimized protein pharmaceuticals 
our business model focuses on developing next generation protein pharmaceuticals that address significant markets  on our own or with partners 
we currently have four next generation protein therapeutic leads in pre clinical development 
the four lead product candidates seek to address significant opportunities and deficiencies in first generation marketed protein products 
the four product candidates are an optimized alpha interferon for the treatment of hepatitis c virus infection  partnered with roche  an optimized gamma interferon for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other indications  partnered with intermune  and two leads to which we retain all rights an optimized g csf for the treatment of neutropenia and an optimized factor vii to treat uncontrolled bleeding 
we currently expect that inds will be filed on two of these programs in the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
product development costs and timelines can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to accurately predict 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in addition to our focus in human therapeutics  we established two industrial subsidiaries 
our chemicals subsidiary codexis focuses on the development of biocatalysis and fermentation processes and products for the pharmaceutical industry 
codexis now has five processes operating at commercial scale  each process generating royalty payments from partners 
codexis also has over potential products and processes in development with partners or in its own research and development pipeline 
on july  we completed the sale of verdia  our agriculture subsidiary  to pioneer hi bred international  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ei du pont de nemours and company  for cash proceeds of million 
as a result of the sale of verdia  the discussion in this section reflects the results of verdia as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
during the first quarter of  our voting rights in codexis were reduced below 
as a result  as of such date we will no longer consolidate the financial results of codexis with maxygen s financial results 
to date  we have generated revenues from research collaborations with pharmaceutical  chemical  agriculture and petroleum companies and from government grants 
moving forward  we anticipate establishing additional strategic alliances 
however  as our internal resources and expertise have grown  we have strategically shifted our dependence on collaborative partner funding to advance our product candidates and business to an increased focus on internal product development in order to capture more of the potential value resulting from our efforts 
we believe that this is an important step in building long term value in maxygen 
however  in the 
table of contents immediate term this will mean reduced revenues and increased net loss 
for the purposes of this report  our continuing operations consist of the results of maxygen  inc and our wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark and maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands  as well as our chemicals subsidiary  codexis  inc consistent with our strategic shift  revenue from continuing operations from strategic alliances and government grants decreased from million in to million in to million in as of the first quarter of  codexis will not be a consolidated subsidiary of maxygen and our revenue is expected to decrease accordingly 
we continue to maintain a strong cash position to fund our expanded internal product development  with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million as of december  of this amount  million is held by codexis  with a balance of approximately million held by maxygen for its therapeutics business 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have invested heavily in establishing our proprietary technologies 
our research and development expenses from continuing operations for were million compared to million for we expect to incur additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  including those that reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the amounts of maxygen and our wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark and maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands  as well as our consolidated subsidiary  codexis  inc all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the operations of verdia  inc prior to its sale on july  are reflected as discontinued operations 
our ownership in codexis was approximately as of december   based upon the voting rights of the issued and outstanding shares of codexis common and preferred stock 
based upon management s evaluation of the investors rights under eitf consensus  investor accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority stockholder or stockholders have certain approval or veto rights and paragraph of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  we have included of the net losses of codexis in the determination of our consolidated net loss 
we record minority interest in the consolidated balance sheets to account for the ownership interest of the minority owners 
as a result of the issuance of codexis common stock in connection with the acquisition by codexis of julich fine chemicals gmbh and certain other matters that occurred in the first quarter of  our voting rights in codexis have been reduced below 
as of the date upon which such rights fell below  codexis will no longer be a consolidated subsidiary of maxygen 
we expect that our investment in codexis will as of such date be accounted for under the equity method 
on july   maxygen and several third party investors formed avidia research institute 
in conjunction with its initial capitalization  we contributed certain technology to avidia and invested  during  we provided a series of loans to avidia in the aggregate amount of million 
this loan is scheduled to be converted into equity of avidia upon a future sale of avidia equity securities 
our ownership in 
table of contents avidia was approximately as of december   based upon the voting rights of the issued and outstanding shares of avidia s common and preferred stock 
our investment in avidia is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting and our share of its results are recorded to the extent of our accounting basis in avidia as a component of equity in net loss of minority investee in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december  we had recorded losses equal to our investment basis in avidia 
maxygen is not obligated to fund avidia s operating losses 
goodwill and intangible impairment in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition  we allocated million to goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets are generally evaluated on an individual acquisition or market basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we review our long lived assets including goodwill for impairment at least annually based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair values 
no impairment charges were recorded in  or the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
once it is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by sfas no 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include existing product portfolio  product development cycle  development expenses  potential royalties and product sales  costs of goods and selling expenses and overall product lifecycle 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other external events  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenues from research collaboration agreements as earned upon our achievement of the performance requirements of the agreements 
our existing corporate collaboration agreements generally provide for research funding for a specified number of full time equivalent researchers working in defined research programs 
revenue related to these payments is earned as the related research work is performed 
in addition  these collaborators may make technology advancement payments that are intended to fund further development of our core technology  as opposed to a defined research program 
such payments are recognized ratably over the applicable funding period 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are achieved 
as of december   we have deferred revenues of approximately million that we expect to recognize over the next approximately two years 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event when we have no future performance obligations related to the payment and we judge the event to be the culmination of a separate earnings process 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to maxygen  such as 
table of contents regulatory approval to market a product 
we receive royalties from licensees  which are based on sales to third parties of licensed products 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of our core technology  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
the determination of separate units of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables as required under eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  requires management to exercise judgment as to whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the collaborator and to estimate whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
our collaborative agreements may contain multiple deliverables that require management to determine whether or not the deliverables are separate units of accounting 
revenue related to grant agreements with various government agencies is recognized as the related research and development expenses are incurred  and when these research and development expenses are within the prior approved funding amounts 
certain grant agreements provide an option for the government to audit the amount of research and development expenses  both direct and indirect  that have been submitted to the government agency for reimbursement 
we believe the overhead rates we used to calculate our indirect research and development expenses are within the contractual guidelines of allowable costs and are reasonable estimates of our indirect expenses incurred through the term of the agreements 
our sources of potential revenues for the next several years are likely to be license  research  technology advancement and milestone payments under existing and possible future collaborative arrangements  government research grants  and royalties from our collaborators based upon revenues received from any products commercialized under those agreements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense for options granted to employees has been determined as the intrinsic value of any stock options granted with exercise prices below the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for options granted to consultants has been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas and emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
compensation expense for related options granted to consultants is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees before our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in and million in these amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized as charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using a graded vesting method 
we recognized stock compensation expense related to the deferred compensation amortization on these option grants  which relate to research and development expense and general and administrative expense  as shown in the following table in thousands research and development general and administrative as of december   we had fully amortized to expense all deferred compensation relating to pre ipo grants of stock options to employees 

table of contents in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition in august  stock options were granted in exchange for outstanding warrants to purchase maxygen aps securities 
in connection with this exchange we recorded aggregate deferred compensation totaling million 
this amount was amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options  of which  was expensed in and  in this deferred compensation was fully amortized to expense as of december  also in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition  maxygen shares were exchanged for maxygen aps shares 
for the shares exchanged that had a right of repurchase  we recorded deferred compensation of million 
this amount was amortized to expense over a three year graded vesting period 
a total of million was recognized as expense in and  in this deferred compensation was fully amortized to expense as of december  in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants  we recorded stock compensation expense of  in   in and  in  which were included in research and development expense  and  in   in and  in  which were included in general and administrative expense 
results of operations revenues our total revenues from continuing operations have decreased from million in to million in and to million in the decline in collaborative research and development revenue of million from to was primarily due to the decrease in partner funding as the funded research terms of the collaborations with intermune and lundbeck wound down on schedule  offset in part by collaborative research and development revenue from our collaboration with roche  which began in july the decline in collaborative research and development revenue of million from to was primarily due to a decrease in partner funding as the funded research terms of maxygen s collaborations with lundbeck and alk abell a s  and codexis collaboration with chevron  wound down on schedule  partially offset by additional revenue from codexis collaboration with pfizer  which commenced in the third quarter of and a full year of revenue from the roche collaboration  which began in july the decline in grant revenue of million from to primarily reflects the expiration of two us government grants from the defense advanced research projects agency that began in and and ended on various dates  the last of which was september the decline in grant revenue of  from to primarily reflects the recognition of grant revenue in for a one time study 
we expect that our revenue for will decrease considerably due primarily to the deconsolidation of codexis during the first quarter of and our continuing focus on internally funded rather than collaboratively funded research 
in we had two major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of total collaborative research revenue in  for whom we conducted research and development 
the funded research term of our collaboration with roche is scheduled to end in july the funded research term of our collaboration with aventis pasteur ended in november in  revenue recognized from pfizer  represented of our total revenues 
revenues for each operating segment are derived from our research collaboration agreements and government research grants and are categorized based on the industry of the product or technology under development 
after their capitalization in march  the results of codexis are shown as our chemicals segment 
the following table presents revenues for each operating segment in thousands year ended december  human therapeutics chemicals total revenue 
table of contents the decreased revenue for our human therapeutics segment from to primarily reflects the scheduled winding down of the funded research terms of our collaborations with intermune and lundbeck  offset in part by collaborative research and development revenue from our collaboration with roche  which began in july the decrease in revenues for our human therapeutics segment primarily reflects the scheduled winding down of the funded research terms of our collaborations with lundbeck and alk abell a s  partially offset by an increase in revenue from roche in since the collaboration began in july we expect revenue from our human therapeutics segment to decrease in as we continue to implement our strategy of concentrating on internally funded research and development and reduce our dependence on partner funded research and development 
the increase in revenue for our chemicals segment from to is primarily due to a one time termination payment of million from hercules received in to terminate our collaboration agreement entered into with them in  offset in part by decreased revenue from the termination of that collaboration 
the decrease in revenue for our chemicals segment from to is primarily due to the one time termination payment from hercules received in and the scheduled winding down of codexis collaboration with chevron  partially offset by additional revenue from codexis collaboration with pfizer  which commenced in the third quarter of research and development expenses we have entered into a number of research and development collaborations to perform research for our collaborators 
the major collaborative agreements have similar contractual terms 
the agreements generally require us to devote a specified number of full time equivalent employees to the research efforts over defined terms generally ranging from three to five years 
we do not track fully burdened research and development costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  we do estimate  based on full time equivalent personnel effort  the percentage of research and development efforts as measured in hours incurred  which approximates costs undertaken for projects funded by  on the one hand  our collaborators and government grants and  on the other hand  projects funded by maxygen 
we believe that presenting our research and development expenses in these categories will provide our investors with meaningful information on how our resources are being used 
the following table presents our approximate research and development expenses by funding category in thousands year ended december  collaborative projects funded by third parties internal projects total as we do not track fully burdened research and development costs by project  the expense figures are comprised of the number of hours expended in each category multiplied by the approximate cost per hour of research and development effort 
in addition  project specific external costs are added to these costs 
due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize the results of the research  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product and therefore whether we will receive future milestone payments or royalty payments under our various collaborations 
most of our human therapeutic and chemical product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any marketed products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
human therapeutic product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical 
table of contents trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality 
chemical processes and potential products may be found ineffective  may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at commercial acceptable specifications at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality 
furthermore  it is uncertain which of our internally developed product candidates will be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report titled risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost in any particular case 
our research and development expenses from continuing operations consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  research consultants and external collaborative research expenses  including contract manufacturing  facility costs  supplies and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in then increased to million in the million decrease from to was primarily due to contraction of activities in strategic alliances including reduced pre clinical costs and reduced utilization of research consultants 
the million increase from to was primarily due to increased expenditures associated with the development of our product candidates  including the manufacture of product candidates in preparation for clinical trials and the termination costs associated with discontinuing clinical development of our interferon beta program 
stock compensation expense related to research and development was million in  million in and  in the decrease in stock compensation expenses was primarily the result of lower amortization expense related to deferred compensation for the shares subject to repurchase that were exchanged in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition in august and to deferred compensation related to options granted to employees involved in research and development activities before our initial public offering 
the deferred compensation relating to the shares subject to repurchase that were exchanged in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition in august was amortized to expense over a three year graded vesting period and was fully amortized to expense during the deferred compensation related to options granted to employees involved in research and development activities before our initial public offering was amortized over the vesting period using a graded vesting method and was fully amortized to expense by the end of we expect that our research and development costs will decrease for  due primarily to the deconsolidation of codexis during the first quarter of  partially offset by an increase in research and development costs in the remainder of our consolidated operations as we increase our efforts on internally funded projects 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our product candidates into clinical trials 
to the extent we out license our product candidates prior to commencement of clinical trials or collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
we intend to manage the level of our expenditures for research and development  including clinical trials  to balance advancing our product candidates against maintaining adequate cash resources for our operations 
stock compensation expense related to research and development will increase upon our implementation of financial accounting standards board statement no 
r 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  business development  legal and general management  as well as insurance premiums and professional expenses  such as legal  accounting and commercial assessment of potential products 
general and administrative expenses have increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase 
table of contents from to was primarily due to receipt of expense reimbursement from litigation with enchira biotechnology received in  partially offset by slightly lower headcount and lower corporate communications expenses in the increase from to was primarily due to professional fees related to an increase in market research and product profile development activity and regulatory compliance costs 
general and administrative stock compensation expense was million in   in and  in the decrease in stock compensation expense was primarily a result of lower amortization expense related to deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees before our initial public offering 
this deferred compensation was amortized to expense over the vesting period of the options using a graded vesting method and was fully amortized by the end of we expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in  due primarily to the deconsolidation of codexis during the first quarter of  partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses in the remainder of our consolidated operations as a result of increased professional fees and insurance premiums 
stock compensation expense related to general and administration will increase upon our implementation of financial accounting standards board statement no 
r 
amortization of other intangible assets in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition  we allocated million to other intangible assets 
we amortized the purchased core technology over its estimated three year useful life 
such technology was fully amortized to expense by september we recorded amortization expense of million in and  in interest income and other expense  net interest income and other expense  net represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  net of interest expense on our equipment leases and currency transaction gains or losses related to the funding of our danish subsidiary maxygen aps 
included in these amounts are foreign exchange gains of million in  million in and  in interest income and other expense  net decreased from million in to million in and to million in the decrease from to was due to declining interest rates and lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  partially offset by foreign exchange transactions 
the decrease from to was primarily due to lower foreign exchange gains in compared with equity in losses of minority investee equity in losses of minority investee reflects our share of the net loss of avidia research institute 
avidia research institute was formed in july and is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in  we invested  in avidia in exchange for series a convertible preferred stock 
in  we provided a million loan to avidia 
this loan will be converted into equity of avidia upon a future sale of avidia equity securities 
the loan has an interest rate of per annum 
as of december  and  we had recorded losses equal to our investment basis in avidia  which includes the million loan to avidia in maxygen is not obligated to further fund avidia s operating losses 
subsidiary preferred stock accretion on september   codexis sold million of codexis series b convertible preferred stock to investors  of which million was purchased by maxygen and million was purchased by several unrelated investors 
on october   codexis sold an additional million of series b convertible preferred stock to unrelated investors 
series b convertible preferred stock includes a redemption provision  which provides that the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of series b convertible preferred stock excluding the series b convertible preferred stock held by maxygen and its affiliates  voting together as a separate class  may 
table of contents require codexis to redeem the series b convertible preferred stock 
the redemption price for each share will be payable in cash in exchange for the shares of series b convertible preferred stock to be redeemed at a sum equal to the applicable original issue price per share plus five percent of the original issue price per year from the original issue date until the applicable redemption date  plus declared and unpaid dividends 
notice of redemption can be given at any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the original issue date 
in connection with these redemption rights  we recorded accretion of the redemption premium for the series b convertible preferred stock  excluding the shares owned by maxygen  in the amount of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the accretion is recorded as subsidiary preferred stock accretion on the consolidated statement of operations and as a reduction of additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets 
any obligation to make redemption payments is solely an obligation of codexis and any payments are to be made solely from assets of codexis 
provision for income taxes for  we reported an income tax provision of  attributable to alternative minimum taxes as a result of the sale of verdia 
this amount has been netted against the gain on sale of verdia and is reflected in gain on sale of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
for and  there was no provision for us federal  us state  or foreign income taxes for any period as we incurred operating losses in those periods  for all jurisdictions 
in  we reported income due to the sale of verdia and will utilize prior net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance increased by million in and million during due primarily to increases in net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance decreased by million during due to the use of net operating loss carryforwards to offset the income due to the sale of verdia 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in the years through included in our federal net operating loss carryforwards and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards at december  are amounts relating to codexis  a subsidiary that is not included in our federal consolidated return 
these carryforwards will only be available to offset future federal taxable income of the subsidiary 
at december   the federal net operating loss carryforwards relating to codexis were approximately million and the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards relating to codexis were approximately  these carryforwards expire in the years through utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating losses and credits before utilization 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply to variable interest entities created after january  variable interest entities created after january   but prior to january   may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation of fin or revised interpretations of fin issued by the fasb in december however  the revised interpretations must be applied no later than the first quarter of fiscal year variable interest entities created after january  must be accounted for under the revised interpretations 
there has been no material impact to our financial statements from potential variable interest entities created after january  or from the adoption of the deferred provisions of the revised interpretations in the first quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents in november  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on paragraph of issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
effective for years ending after december   eitf requires certain disclosures for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
in november the fasb delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf  this delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature 
the disclosure requirement of this guidance remains in effect 
we do not expect eitf to significantly impact our results of operations or financial position but will reassess the impact once the rules are finalized 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt statement using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall cash position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend upon  among other things  levels of share based payments granted in the future  when employees exercise stock options and if and when we become profitable 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our continuing operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity securities  receiving aggregate consideration from such sales totaling million and committed research and development funding from collaborators and government grants totaling approximately million 
in addition  on july  we received million in cash as proceeds  before estimated income taxes and transaction costs of million  from the sale of our agriculture segment  verdia 
our consolidated subsidiary  codexis  also has received million from private placements of its equity securities  million from third party investors and million from maxygen 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this includes million of which may only be used for codexis operations 
net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was million in  million in and million in uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund net losses 
the increase in cash used in operating activities for continuing operations from to primarily relates to lower revenue in due to the decrease in partner funding as the funded research terms of the collaborations with intermune and lundbeck wound down on schedule and lower interest income 
the increase in cash used in operating activities for continuing operations from to primarily relates to increased expenditures in relating to advancing product candidates into manufacturing and toward clinical trials  lower interest income in  increased equity in losses of minority investee during  and a smaller net loss in  due partially to a one time non recurring million payment from hercules to terminate its collaboration with codexis recognized as revenue in the first quarter of net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was million in and million in net cash used in investing activities in was million 
the cash provided during primarily represented maturities of available for sale securities  net of purchases 
net cash used in investing activities in primarily represented purchases of available for sale securities in excess of maturities 
the cash provided during was primarily related to the proceeds from the sale of verdia offset in part by purchases of available for sale securities in excess maturities 
in connection with the formation of avidia research institute  maxygen contributed certain intellectual property and invested  in july during  we provided a million loan to avidia 
the majority of additions of property and equipment in relates to codexis investment in its bioprocessing facility 
we expect to continue to make investments in the purchase of property and equipment to support our operations 
we expect to use a portion of our cash to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  or to obtain the right to use such technologies

the financing agreement expires march  the equipment loans will be repaid over months at an interest rate tied to the prime lending rate at the time the loans were executed and are secured by the related equipment 
as of december   codexis had million outstanding under such equipment loans 
since inception we have received million from our collaborators and from government grants  which includes million of funding received by verdia  our agriculture subsidiary and sole component of our agriculture segment  prior to its disposition  and million of deferred revenue from continuing operations to be recognized over the next two years 
approximately million was received from our collaborators and million was received from government funding 
assuming our research efforts for existing collaborations and grants continue for their full research terms  as of december  we had total committed funding of approximately million remaining to be received over the next two years  of which million is to be received by codexis 
potential milestone payments from our existing collaborations could exceed million based on the accomplishment of specific performance criteria 
we may also earn royalties on product sales 
in general  the obligation of our corporate collaborators to provide research funding cannot be terminated by either party before the end of the research term unless there has been a material breach of contract or either party has become bankrupt or insolvent 
in the case of such an event  the agreement specifies the rights  if any  that each party will retain 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  together with funding received from collaborators and government grants  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
additional funding  if sought  may not be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results

to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risk  we from time to time enter currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate obligations and money market funds 
all securities are held in us currency except for amounts held in our danish subsidiary in danish kroner 
as of december   approximately of our total portfolio was to mature in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than two years 
the following table represents the fair value balance of our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands expected maturity cash and cash equivalents average interest rates short term investments average interest rates long term investments average interest rates we did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of december   and we have never held such instruments in the past 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest

as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the danish kroner 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar against the danish kroner will result in an increase of our reported operating expenses 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we from time to time enter into cash flow hedging arrangements 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to maxygen on the amounts hedged 
at december  we had foreign currency contracts outstanding in the form of forward exchange contracts totaling million which will be settled over the next twelve months with an average exchange rate of danish kroner to the us dollar 
as of december   a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the danish kroner would result in an additional million gain on these contracts 
during  we recognized million in foreign exchange gains from hedge contracts  these gains were offset against operating expenses 
we did not have any foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december
