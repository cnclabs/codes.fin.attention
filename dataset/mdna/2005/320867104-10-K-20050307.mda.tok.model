the foregoing list of important factors may not be all inclusive  and the company specifically declines to undertake any obligation to publicly revise any forward looking statements that have been made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
with respect to forward looking statements set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements  including those relating to contingent liabilities and legal proceedings  some of the factors that could affect the ultimate disposition of those contingencies are changes in applicable laws  the development of facts in individual cases  settlement opportunities  and the actions of plaintiffs  judges  and juries 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
application of critical accounting policies  those policies that management believes are the most important to the company s financial position and results of operations  requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company has numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on page of this form k 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that its accounting policies with respect to the reserve for loan losses and income taxes are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below 
reserve for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of reserve for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s reserve for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known  and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses as well as its assessment of the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the reserve is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of 
table of contents assessing the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on page of this form k 
income taxes the company accounts for income tax expense by applying an estimated effective tax rate to its pre tax income 
the effective tax rate is based on management s judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes 
in addition  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities  recorded in the consolidated statements of condition  based on management s judgments and estimates regarding temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is unlikely 
in making this assessment  management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carry back to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  and the possible application of future tax planning strategies 
although the company has determined a valuation allowance is not required for any deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that these assets are recognizable

performance overview general overview the company  through its banking network  provides the full range of both business and retail banking and trust and investment management services through banking offices  primarily in suburban metropolitan chicago 
the company believes that its continued profitable growth is the result of its consistent focus on relationship management and fulfilling customer needs  a strong culture of credit and operational control  and the quality and depth of the market it serves 
the primary source of the company s revenue is net interest income from loans and deposits and fees from financial services provided to customers 
business volumes tend to be influenced by overall economic factors including market interest rates  business spending  and consumer confidence  as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace 
the company had another year of record performance in the company s net income for increased on a per diluted share basis to a record million  or per diluted share  from net income of million  or per diluted share  in in  the company s return on average assets was as compared to in and its return on average equity was as compared to in in comparison to  the company s net income benefited from million higher earning asset levels  which generated higher tax equivalent net interest income of million  million higher net realized security gains  million lower losses resulting from extinguishment of debt  and improved fee revenue 
partially offsetting these benefits were million in higher provisions for loan losses  million in higher noninterest expense  lower income generated from the disposition of assets  and a higher effective tax rate 
the company s overall profitability continues to benefit from strong earnings  solid credit quality  cost control  and efficient use of capital 
the company s total loans of billion at december  increased from december  during the fourth quarter  the company converted million of its family residential mortgages into an investment security 
also in fourth quarter  the company exited its marginally profitable indirect consumer lending business  resulting in a million decline in outstanding loans from year end to excluding both family residential loans and indirect consumer loans  the company s total loans increased as commercial  agricultural  commercial real estate  and home equity consumer loan categories all grew 
commercial loan growth trends remain favorable  and commercial loans outstanding as of december  increased by compared to december  consumer home equity loans increased from december   reflecting continued sales success 
total deposits as of december  totaled billion  up from december  demand and time deposit balances outstanding as of december  increased and  respectively  in comparison to  largely due to targeted sales efforts and consumer preferences 

table of contents the company s credit quality improved during nonperforming assets totaled million as of december   down from million as of december  as of december   the ratio of nonperforming assets plus days past due loans to total loans plus foreclosed real estate was  improving from as of december  during  the company completed the successful integration of covest bancshares  inc  a bank holding company in northwestern suburban cook county that the company acquired on december  the covest acquisition 
as a result  the company s average assets increased in by million over  while requiring only a minimal increase in back office support 
business outlook the company feels that it is well positioned for continued performance improvement because it operates in strong markets with favorable business fundamentals 
as a result of improving economic conditions  the company expects continued expansion in the markets it serves  which should generate a greater demand for the company s products and services 
the competition for bank products and services continues to intensify in the chicago metropolitan area as banks headquartered both within and outside of chicago have announced aggressive expansion plans 
the company continues to believe it can compete successfully because of the high quality of its products and services  its unique relationship based approach to banking  and its knowledge of and connections to its communities 
overall performance is expected to benefit from increased net interest income due to higher interest earning asset levels  deposit acquisition  and fee growth 
interest earning asset improvement should result from improved loan demand due to favorable trends in corporate and home equity lending 
these benefits are likely to be offset by the expectation of a higher loan loss provision due to anticipated loan growth  increased noninterest expense  and an increased effective tax rate 
the company s optimism for is tempered by its expectation for higher interest rates and the inherent uncertainties that arise as the economy transitions from a period of year lows in interest rates 
overall  the company expects net interest margin performance to benefit more from rising than falling or stable interest rates and expects assets to reprice more quickly than liabilities 
although net interest margin in may benefit from rising rates  it is likely to stabilize or contract if short term interest rates increase at the same or a faster pace than intermediate and long term rates 
the company s earnings could be negatively impacted  however  if interest rates remain stable or unexpectedly decrease 
further  if the relationship between short and long term rates narrows  the expected benefit from rising short term interest rates could be offset to some degree 
earnings performance net interest income net interest income represents the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income generally occur due to fluctuations in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and the rates earned and paid  on these assets and liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of total interest earning assets 
for purposes of this discussion  both net interest income and margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax exempt loans and securities to those on taxable earning assets 
the accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans  securities  and other earning assets are presented in notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on pages   and  respectively  of this form k

net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  an improvement from third quarter s and second quarter s 
this linked quarter margin improvement reflects the benefit of rising short term interest rates  which increased basis points since june  in addition  linked quarter performance benefited from higher security yields as mortgage related prepayment speeds slowed 
net interest margin declined during the first half of as a greater volume of interest earning assets began to reprice during that period of continued low interest rates 
in part  the speed of this decline was accelerated as a result of the impact of refinance related prepayments on mortgage backed securities and certain measures taken by management to better insulate net interest income and margin from the potential of future rising interest rates 
the section entitled qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk  commencing on page  describes the measures taken during the year and discusses the techniques used to manage the volatility and other factors that affect net interest margin and net interest income

the company seeks to maintain a diversified portfolio of corporate loans to minimize its exposure to any particular industry or any segment of the economy 
real estate commercial and construction lending has always been an area of specialty for the company 
because of the strength of the suburban chicago real estate market over the past several years  real estate commercial and construction lending grew to approximately of the company s total loans as of december  the combination of seasoned  long time borrowers  experienced senior lending officers  management s focus on market fundamentals  and a stringent underwriting process gives the company a competitive market advantage 
these factors and a balanced exposure to any particular industry segment have reduced the company s exposure to loss 
real estate commercial loans consist of income producing commercial property loans  multi unit residential mortgages  and commercial real estate mortgages 
approximately of the company s real estate commercial loans represent multi family loans made to real estate companies and to individual investors to finance or refinance apartment buildings 
these apartment buildings are primarily concentrated in the metropolitan chicago area and typically range in size from five units up to twenty four units  although larger projects may range up to units or more 
the company believes that this type of lending helps diversify its already strong commercial and multifamily development real estate platform and represents an opportunity for growth 
real estate construction loans are primarily single family and multi family residential and non residential projects located in the company s primary markets 
real estate construction loans are a profitable line of lending for the company due to the higher level of interest rates and fees earned on such loans as compared to other loan categories and the favorable loss experience on these loans

indirect consumer lending has declined as the company slowed new volumes by tightening underwriting standards in and decided to exit this marginally profitable business in the home equity category represents the single largest and fastest growing portion of the consumer portfolio  consisting mainly of revolving lines of credit secured by junior liens on owner occupied real estate 
as a general rule  loan to value ratios for these credits range from to 
consumer loan balances as of december  decreased from december  reflecting two asset redeployment decisions elected by management 
first  the company converted million of certain family residential mortgages into an investment security during the fourth quarter of second  the company exited its marginally profitable indirect consumer lending business  resulting in a year over year million reduction of loan outstandings from december  this decline was partially offset in by increased home equity line sales activity  resulting from pricing and promotional activities 
real estate family loans further declined in as customers continued to refinance loans in the low interest rate environment 
the company retains originated variable rate and certain other qualifying mortgages  while selling all other originations through a third party provider 
as previously discussed in the section titled investment portfolio management commencing on page of this form k  the company s portfolio exposure to family real estate is balanced with that embedded in its securities portfolio  as these assets tend to be longer in duration and have similar risk characteristics 
distribution of corporate loans by industry table summarizes the company s ten largest industry segments for the corporate loan portfolio as of december    and the effectiveness of such analysis  however  is limited to the extent that classification by segment requires that allocation of a customer s aggregate loans outstanding be based upon the nature of the borrower s ongoing business activity as opposed to the purpose of the collateral underlying an individual loan

table of contents credit quality management and reserve for loan losses in addition to the portfolio diversification previously discussed  the company has established a thorough system of internal controls to mitigate credit risk  including standard lending and credit policies  underwriting criteria and collateral safeguards 
the company monitors and implements its formal credit policies and procedures and continues to evaluate the quality  trends  collectibility  and collateral protection within the loan portfolio 
the company s policy and procedures are regularly reviewed and modified in order to manage risk as conditions change and new credit products are offered 
the company s credit administration policies include a comprehensive loan rating system 
the internal loan review staff annually reviews at least of all corporate loans and commitments and all new loans and commitments in excess of million 
account officers are vested with the responsibility of monitoring their customer relationships and act as the first line of defense in determining changes in the loan ratings on credits for which they are responsible 
the company believes that any significant change in the overall quality of the loan portfolio will be reflected by these loan ratings within this monitoring system 
the company s senior managers actively review those loans that require some form of remediation 
those loans are reviewed at regular quarterly meetings between the credit administration staff and the account officers  and action plans are developed to either remedy any emerging problem loans or develop a specific plan for removing such loans from the portfolio 
such periodic reviews are then escalated for review by senior executive officers  including the chief executive officer 
during times of economic duress  the company has increased the frequency of these meetings 
the company maintains a reserve for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the reserve for loan losses consists of three components i specific reserves established for expected losses resulting from analysis developed through specific credit allocations on individual loans for which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the measured value of the loan  ii reserves based on historical loan loss experience for each loan category  and iii reserves based on general  current economic conditions as well as specific economic factors believed to be relevant to the markets in which the company operates 
management evaluates the sufficiency of the reserve for loan losses based upon the combined total of the specific  historical loss and general components 
the accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the reserve for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on pages and  respectively  of this form k 
table shows the allocation of the reserve for loan losses by loan category  as well as charge off and recovery information for the last years

the lower level of charge offs in primarily benefited from a tightening of the underwriting standards for the indirect lending portfolio initiated in as the economy weakened 
in addition  the level of corporate charge offs in and were elevated as the company recognized the weakening economy and adopted an aggressive problem loan identification and charge off strategy 
the company increased the reserve for loan losses allocated to the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate categories in from due to loan growth  as well as elevated losses attributed to loans acquired from and originated by covest 
reserve allocations to the consumer loan portfolio decreased in compared to as a result of improved delinquency and charge off trends as the portfolio mix shifted from higher risk  indirect lending to lower risk home equity lending 
in  allocation of the company s reserve to the commercial and industrial  real estate commercial  and real estate construction categories increased as compared to  due in large part to comparatively higher exposures to single borrowers and portfolio growth amid concerns relative to the continuing level of economic weakness 
the growth in the commercial reserve allocation was also caused by an increase in specific reserves relating to the higher level of impaired loans 
these category increases were partly offset by improved delinquency and charge off trends in all corporate lending areas 
reserve allocations to the consumer loan portfolio decreased in relation to due to improved delinquency and charge off trends 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued  loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest and principal due to a weakening of the borrower s financial condition  and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition 
for a detailed discussion on the company s policy on accrual of interest on loans see note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on page of this form k

the million increase in total nonperforming loans in reflected an increase of million in nonperforming commercial and industrial and real estate construction loans  partially offset by a decrease of million in real estate commercial 
the increase in in nonperforming commercial and industrial and real estate construction loans was principally due to the million of nonaccruing loans acquired from covest 
the loans acquired were comprehensively reviewed by the company and deemed to be appropriately valued 
the ratio of the reserve for loan losses to nonperforming loans at year end was  down from s historical high of 
in addition to the loans summarized in table  on december   the company had million of loans that are now performing  but for which the company had some concern with the ability of the borrower to comply with existing loan repayment terms 
this amount decreased from million at year end  following an increase from million at year end these loans continue to perform under existing terms and accrue interest 
the company anticipates that the type of restructure  guarantee  additional collateral  or such planned action will reflect the full liquidation of debt 
the classification of these loans  however  does not imply that management expects losses on these loans but rather that a higher level of scrutiny is prudent under the circumstances 
s decrease and s increase as compared to the prior year reflects the identification and subsequent improvement of two large credit relationships  which management believed warranted greater scrutiny at the end of given the state of the economy and the circumstances of the borrower 
in addition  the increase in s classification as compared to stems  in large part  from the acquisition of the covest portfolio on december   as well as management s concerns about the stability of the economy at the end of funding and liquidity management liquidity management is the ability to provide funding sources at a minimum cost to meet fluctuating deposit  withdrawal  and loan demand needs 
the company s liquidity policy establishes parameters as to how liquidity should be managed to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in liquidity needs over a month forward period  including the requirement to formulate a quarterly liquidity compliance plan for review by the bank s board of directors 
the compliance plan includes an analysis that measures projected needs to purchase and sell funds 
inherent in the analysis is a set of projected balance sheet assumptions that are updated quarterly throughout the year 
based on such assumptions  the company determines its total cash liquidity on hand and adds to that position excess collateral capacity from pledging  unused federal funds purchased lines  and other unused borrowing capacity such as federal home loan bank fhlb advances  resulting in a calculation of the company s total liquidity capacity 
the company s total policy directed liquidity requirement is of total sources demand deposits  interest bearing transactions deposits  retail time deposits  other borrowings  and other liabilities and equity less pledged deposits 
based upon the company s projections as of december   the company expects to have net excess liquidity capacity  based upon policy guidelines  for the forward twelve month period 
the liquidity needs of first midwest bancorp  inc on an unconsolidated basis parent company consist primarily of operating expenses and dividend payments to its stockholders 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from subsidiaries 
at december   the parent company had short term credit facilities available to fund cash flow needs totaling million 
the parent company also has the ability to enhance its liquidity position by raising capital or incurring debt 
the parent company had million in subordinated debt from trust preferred securities but had no debt outstanding under its short term credit facilities as of year end the parent company had cash and equivalent short term investments of million as of such date

the current mix of average deposits shifted somewhat over the past two years as transactional deposits currently represent of total funding sources 
in and  the company focused its sales efforts on increasing core funding sources from transactional deposits  as these funding costs are generally less expensive and less price sensitive than wholesale borrowed funds 
as discussed in the section entitled qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk  commencing on page of this form k  these efforts were consistent with the company s strategy to reduce its exposure to increases in market interest rates 
the pricing strategies in and  the overall low level of interest rates  and instability in the equity markets have combined to create an incentive for customers seeking liquidity to retain balances in transactional accounts as opposed to shifting them to longer term time deposits 
given the expectation that equity markets will stabilize and interest rates will increase in  management expects that customer liquidity preferences will change and some portion of transactional balances will revert to time deposits as influenced by then existent pricing and competition 
included as a part of the company s total funding sources are public balances  denoting the funds held on account for municipalities and other public entities 
public balances represent an important customer segment for the company  and reflects the community based roots of the company 
the company enters into specific agreements with public customers to pledge collateral  primarily securities  in support of the balances on account 
because the average customer tenure with the company is years  they provide the company with a reliable  lower cost  short term funding source for its securities portfolio than are available through other wholesale alternatives 
these relationships also provide numerous cross sell and business referral opportunities 
for  the company had average public funds on account totaling million  and approximately of these funds were collateralized 
of this total  million was held in deposit accounts  with the remainder representing securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
this contrasts to average balances maintained of million in and million in year to year changes in balances are influenced by the tax collection activities of the various municipalities as well as the general level of interest rates

capital measurements a strong capital structure is crucial in maintaining investor confidence  accessing capital markets  and enabling the company to take advantage of future profitable growth opportunities 
the company s capital policy requires that the company and the bank maintain a capital ratio in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines and also serves as an internal discipline in analyzing business risks and internal growth opportunities  in addition to setting targeted levels of return on equity 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  the company and the bank are subject to various capital requirements set and administered by the federal banking agencies

this improvement was driven by a million increase in average interest earning assets from fourth quarter  primarily the result of assets acquired in the covest acquisition 
net interest margin for fourth quarter was  down from in fourth quarter  but up from on a linked quarter basis 
this sequential quarter margin improvement was largely the result of earning assets repricing more quickly than paying liabilities as the targeted federal funds rate increased basis points during fourth quarter the company s noninterest income for fourth quarter decreased to million  as compared to million for fourth quarter the decrease from was due to the absence in of million in gains realized from the company s divesture of its two branches in streator  illinois

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
interest rate risk is the company s primary market risk and is the result of repricing  basis  and option risk 
repricing risk represents timing mismatches in the company s ability to alter contractual rates earned on financial assets or paid on liabilities in response to market interest rates 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of the spread earned on a loan or investment relative to its cost of funds 
option risk arises from the embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options or deposit early withdrawal options 
these provide customers opportunities to take advantage of directional changes in rates and could have an adverse impact on the company s margin performance 
the company seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and net income while managing volatility that arises from shifts in interest rates 
the company s asset and liability management committee alco oversees financial risk management by developing programs to measure and manage interest rate risks within authorized limits set by the bank s board of directors 
alco also approves the company s asset liability management policies  oversees the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings  and reviews the company s interest rate sensitivity position 
management uses net interest income and economic value of equity simulation modeling tools to analyze and capture near term and longer term interest rate exposures 
net interest income represents the company s primary tool for measuring interest rate sensitivity 
net interest income simulation analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income to various interest rate movements and balance sheet structures 
the simulation is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
the simulation includes management projections for activity levels in each of the product lines offered by the company 
assumptions based upon the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to interest rates are also incorporated into the simulation 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain 
as a result  the simulation cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of the fluctuation in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the company monitors and manages interest rate risk within approved policy limits 
the simulation model assesses the magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates over a month horizon  using multiple rate scenarios 
these scenarios include  but are not limited to  a flat or unchanged rate environment  a most likely forecast which the company believes to be the most probable outlook  a graduated increase and decrease of basis points that occurs in equal steps over a six month time horizon  and immediate increases and decreases of and basis points 
the company s current interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming a basis point gradual increase and decrease in all interest rate limits 
current policy limits this exposure to plus or minus of the anticipated level of net interest income over the corresponding month horizon assuming no change in current interest rates 
given the low interest rate environment existent at december  and december   the bank s board of directors temporarily authorized operation outside of existing policy limits under the gradual falling rate scenario

n m due to the low level of interest rates as of year end and  in management s judgment an assumed basis point drop in interest rates was deemed not meaningful in the current interest rate environment 
as of december   the company s interest rate sensitivity profile  assuming a gradual change in rates  was less positive in rising interest rate scenarios and less negative in falling rate scenarios than the profile that existed as of december  the change in profile from results from a combination of the comparatively higher level of interest rates existent as of december  and changes in the remaining term and mix of both security investments and wholesale funding 
the higher level of interest rates at december  limits the company s ability to benefit from future interest rate increases  as the positive impact of slowing mortgage prepayments as of december  has already been partially reflected as actual performance during the last half of in addition  the passage of time has shortened the duration of borrowed funds since year end  and the majority of these liabilities will reprice in the latter half of in addition to the simulation analysis  management uses an economic value of equity sensitivity technique to capture the risk in both short and long term positions and to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
economic value of equity involves discounting present values of expected cash flows on all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the company s economic value of equity 
economic value of equity does not represent the true fair value of asset  liability  or derivative positions because factors such as credit risk  liquidity risk  and the impact of future changes to the balance sheet are not considered 
the company s policy guidelines call for preventative measures to be taken in the event that an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points is estimated to reduce the economic value of equity by more than 
analysis of economic value of equity dollar amounts in thousands immediate change in rates december  dollar change percent change december  dollar change percent change the sensitivity of the company s economic value of equity to changes in interest rates has increased in a falling rate scenario and decreased in a rising rate scenario as compared to december  primarily due to changes in securities portfolio mix 
during  the company sold longer term  municipal securities and reinvested the proceeds into comparatively shorter term collateralized mortgage obligations  lessening the duration of the securities portfolio 
this shortening  in combination with strategies to lengthen the duration of liabilities  decreased the level of market value volatility to rising interest rates 
as in  the company s current sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity suggests better performance in a rising interest rate environment  with net interest income over a month horizon benefiting from gradually rising interest rates 
the company s balance sheet and net interest income remain vulnerable to an immediate decrease in 
table of contents interest rates 
alco has deemed the risk of an immediate and extended decline in interest rates to be low given the current rate environment 
as part of its approach to controlling the interest rate risk within its balance sheet  the company has used derivative instruments specifically interest rate swaps with third parties in order to limit volatility in net interest income 
the advantages of using such interest rate derivatives include minimization of balance sheet leverage resulting in lower capital requirements as compared to cash instruments  the ability to maintain or increase liquidity  and the opportunity to customize the interest rate swap to meet desired risk parameters 
the accounting policies underlying the treatment of derivative financial instruments in the consolidated statements of condition and income of the company are described in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on pages and  respectively  of this form k
