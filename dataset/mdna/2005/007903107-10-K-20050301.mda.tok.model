item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of december  and december   and for each of the three years in the period ended december   which are included in this annual report 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
overview we design  manufacture and market industry standard digital ics that are used in diverse product applications such as desktop and mobile pcs  workstations  servers  communications equipment such as mobile phones and automotive and consumer electronics 
our products consist primarily of microprocessors and flash memory devices 
we also sell embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and other consumer markets 
in  we continued to focus on customer centric innovation by developing microprocessor and flash memory products that assist our customers in adding functionality and enhancing the performance of their products 
we continued to design and develop microprocessor products based on amd technology  which allow our customers to protect their existing investments by continuing to use their bit software applications while transitioning to a bit platform 
as of december   sales of amd based processors represented approximately one half of our net sales for the computation products segment 
in flash memory  we continued to manufacture products based on our mirrorbit technology  which we believe will enable our customers to cost effectively include next generation applications  such as high resolution cameras and streaming video  on their mobile phone 
we also introduced floating gate memory products manufactured on nanometer technology and substantially completed the integration of our and fujitsu s flash memory operations in spansion 
we also continued to devote resources to develop advanced manufacturing process technologies 
during  we successfully transitioned to smaller manufacturing geometries for both our microprocessor and flash memory products 
as of december   we were manufacturing our microprocessor products using primarily nanometer technology and we were manufacturing our highest density and performance flash memory products on nanometer floating gate and mirrorbit technology 
in  despite a net loss in the fourth quarter  we returned to a full year of profitability 
total net sales for of billion increased percent compared with net sales of billion for this increase was driven primarily by increased sales of microprocessors and flash memory products across all geographies as well as the effects of consolidating spansion s results of operations  which include sales by spansion to fujitsu  for the twelve months in as compared to six months in our transition to smaller manufacturing process geometries for both our microprocessor and flash memory products contributed to lower manufacturing costs per unit and higher overall gross margins  which  along with increased net sales  contributed to a net income of million in compared to a net loss of million in we also substantially completed the construction of fab  our millimeter wafer fabrication facility in dresden  germany and we are currently in the process of installing equipment 
we believe the new capacity provided by this facility  which we expect to be in volume production in  will allow us to satisfy anticipated demand for our microprocessors 
however  in  the cyclical flash memory market posed unique challenges for us 
in the second half of  memory products net sales decreased by million  compared to the first half of factors that 
table of contents contributed to this decline included aggressive pricing by competitors and an imbalance in the supply and demand for flash memory products 
in addition  decreased demand from the wireless handset market in asia  in part due to channel inventory accumulation by wireless handset oems in china  contributed to a decline in memory products net sales during the third quarter of the down turn in the overall flash memory market  lower than expected sales in japan and a delay in our qualification of a flash memory product for the wireless category contributed to lower memory products net sales during the fourth quarter of for  we believe critical success factors include continuing to increase market acceptance of our amd technology  particularly in the enterprise segment  taking products based on our second generation mirrorbit technology to market and effectively ramping such products to mass production on a timely basis  strengthening our relationships with key customers and establishing relationships with new customers that are industry leaders in their markets  successfully developing and continuing to transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies for both our microprocessor and flash memory products  developing and introducing new microprocessor products for the mobile  server and workstation markets  including dual core processors  on a timely basis and increasing our share of those markets  developing and introducing new flash memory products on a timely basis  controlling costs  increasing the adoption of mirrorbit technology  and expanding our participation in high growth global markets  including china  latin america  india and eastern europe 
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  the primary factors that resulted in those changes  and how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted united states accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to our revenues  inventories  asset impairments  restructuring charges and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations  the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue reserves 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales and a provision for estimated future price reductions in the same period that the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on actual historical sales returns  allowances  historical price reductions  market activity  and other known or anticipated trends and factors 
these estimates are subject to management s judgment  and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions  resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results 
inventory valuation 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
these projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near term factory production planning 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand of generally six months or less  are not valued 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
we adjust remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
among other 
table of contents factors  management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand  competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value 
if we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our projections as forecasted  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
this would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period 
if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period  related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales  resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period 
to the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins  we would disclose them in our filings with the sec 
impairment of long lived assets 
we consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
these indicators may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
if these or other indicators are present  we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used  we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset s carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
we may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change 
restructuring charges 
we record and account for our restructuring activities following formally approved plans that identify the actions and timeline over which the restructuring activities will occur 
our remaining restructuring accruals include estimates pertaining to facility exit costs and subleasing assumptions resulting from exiting certain facilities 
we review these accruals on a quarterly basis and adjust these accruals when changes in facts and circumstances suggest actual amounts will differ from our estimates 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  actual costs may be different than our original or revised estimates 
these changes in estimates can result in increases or decreases to our results of operations in future periods and would be presented on the restructuring and other special charges recoveries  net  line of our consolidated operating statements 
income taxes 
in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we consider past performance  future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our us deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets at the time 
in fiscal  we continued to provide a valuation allowance against all of our us deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities 
in fiscal  a portion of the valuation allowance was utilized as a result of net operating profits 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized  an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed  resulting in a benefit to our earnings 
such benefits would be recorded on the income tax provision benefit line of our statement of operations 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment by the internal revenue service or other taxing 
table of contents jurisdiction 
if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or charge will result 
results of operations in march  we and fujitsu formed fujitsu amd semiconductor limited  a joint venture for the purpose of manufacturing flash memory devices 
through the manufacturing joint venture  we and fujitsu constructed and operated advanced integrated circuit manufacturing facilities in aizu wakamatsu  japan 
effective june   we and fujitsu executed agreements to integrate our flash memory operations 
the manufacturing joint venture was contributed to a new entity  spansion llc  which is owned percent by us and percent by fujitsu 
as a result of this transaction  we began consolidating spansion s results of operations on june  prior to june   we accounted for our share of the manufacturing joint venture s operating results under the equity method 
as spansion did not exist prior to june   the results of our operations for periods prior to the third quarter of do not include the consolidation of spansion s results of operations 
accordingly  our operating results for the years ended december  and december  are not fully comparable with our results for prior periods 
also  because we have a percent controlling interest in spansion  fujitsu s percent share in the net income loss of spansion is reflected as a minority interest adjustment to our consolidated financial statements 
this minority interest adjustment does not correspond to operating income loss of our memory products segment because operating income loss for our memory products segment includes operations incremental to those of spansion 
in addition  the minority interest calculation is based on spansion s net income loss rather than operating income loss 
we review and assess operating performance using segment revenues and operating income before interest  taxes and minority interest 
these performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management judgment 
prior to the third quarter of  we had two reportable segments the core products segment  which consisted of the microprocessor  memory products and other ic products operating segments  and the foundry services segment  which consisted of fees for products sold to vantis corporation  our former programmable logic devices subsidiary  and legerity inc  our former voice communication products subsidiary 
beginning in the third quarter of  we changed our reportable segments to the computation products segment  which includes microprocessor products for desktop and mobile pcs  servers and workstations and chipset products  and the memory products segment  which includes flash memory products 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we began presenting our personal connectivity solutions operating segment as a separate reportable segment because the operating loss from this operating segment exceeded percent of the combined profit of all our operating segments and therefore this operating segment became a reportable segment under the requirements of statement of financial standards  segment reporting fas 
previously  we included our personal connectivity solutions operating segment in our all other category 
the personal connectivity solutions segment includes primarily low power  high performance x and mips architecture based embedded microprocessors 
in addition to our three reportable segments  we also have the all other category  which is not a reportable segment  and which includes certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to the operating segments 
prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
however  because spansion did not exist prior to june   the results of operations for periods prior to june  did not include the consolidation of spansion s operations 
accordingly  the segment operating information for the memory products segment for the year ended december   is not comparable to the reclassified segment information for the prior periods presented 
we use a to week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in december 
the years ended december   december  and december   each included weeks 

table of contents the following is a summary of our net sales and operating income loss by segment and category for  and in millions net sales computation products memory products personal connectivity solutions all other total net sales operating income loss computation products memory products personal connectivity solutions all other total operating income loss computation products computation products net sales of billion in increased percent compared to net sales of billion in the increase was primarily due to a percent increase in average selling prices and a nine percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments 
the increase in average selling prices was primarily due to increased sales of our higher priced amd based processors  particularly our amd athlon processors  which contributed to a richer product mix 
similarly  the increase in unit shipments reflected the increased demand for these processors 
as of december   sales of amd based processors represented approximately one half of our net sales for the computation products segment 
sales increased across all geographic regions  and growth was particularly strong in north america and asia 
computation products net sales of billion in increased percent compared to net sales of billion in the increase was primarily due to a percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments due primarily to increased demand from our oem customers 
the increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline of four percent in the average selling prices 
computation products operating income of million in increased by million compared to an operating loss of million in the increase was primarily due to a percent increase in net sales  partially offset by a percent increase in operating expenses 
operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in marketing and cooperative advertising costs of million in connection with our amd based products  a nine percent increase in unit shipments  and a million increase in research and development costs 
the increase in research and development costs was due primarily to a million increase in fab start up costs and a million increase in silicon design related to future generations of our microprocessors offset by a million decrease in fab research and development activities 
computation products operating loss of million in improved by million compared to an operating loss of million in the improvement was primarily due to a percent increase in net sales and a decrease in both manufacturing costs of million and marketing  general and administrative expenses of million  as a result of our cost reduction initiatives and the restructuring plan 
in addition  cooperative advertising and marketing expenses decreased by million from 
table of contents memory products memory products net sales of billion in increased percent compared to net sales of billion in the increase was primarily due to increased demand for flash memory products across all geographies  which resulted in a nine percent increase in average selling prices  and the effect of consolidating spansion s results of operations  which include spansion s sales to fujitsu of billion for months in compared to million for six months in in the second half of  demand for flash memory products began to increase significantly  and this trend continued through the first half of in the second half of  however  our memory products net sales declined due to aggressive pricing by competitors and an imbalance in the supply and demand for flash memory products 
in addition  decreased demand from the wireless handset market in asia  due in part to channel inventory accumulation by wireless oems in china  contributed to a decline in memory products net sales during the third quarter 
the downturn in the overall flash memory market  lower than expected sales in japan and a delay in qualifying a new flash memory product for the wireless category contributed to lower memory products net sales during the fourth quarter 
further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between amd and fujitsu 
memory products net sales of billion in increased percent compared to net sales of million in the increase was primarily due to the effect of consolidating spansion s results of operations  which include spansion s sales to fujitsu during the last six months of fiscal and increased demand for flash memory products  particularly in the second half of further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between amd and fujitsu 
memory products operating income of million increased million from an operating loss of million in the increase was primarily due to the effect of consolidating spansion s results of operations  which include spansion s sales to fujitsu  for months in compared to six months in in addition  our manufacturing costs decreased due to our transition to nanometer process technology for certain of our flash memory products in and as a result of increased shipments of flash memory products based on mirrorbit technology  which are less expensive to manufacture than flash memory products based on floating gate technology 
further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of spansion on june  memory products operating loss of million in increased million from an operating loss of million in further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of spansion on june personal connectivity solutions personal connectivity solutions pcs net sales of million in decreased seven percent compared to net sales of million in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in sales of certain end of life embedded microprocessors  partially offset by a million increase in sales of amd geode products 
we acquired the geode product line from national semiconductor in august accordingly  the increase in sales of amd geode products in was due to the fact that in we had months of sales whereas in we had approximately four months of sales 
pcs net sales of million in decreased percent compared to net sales of million in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in sales of certain end of life embedded microprocessors and networking products  partially offset by a million increase in sales of amd geode and wireless products 
pcs operating loss of million in increased compared to an operating loss of million in the increase in the operating loss was primarily due to a million increase in operating expenses 
operating 
table of contents expenses increased due to an increase of approximately million in manufacturing costs as a result of a change in product mix  and an aggregate increase of million in research and development expenses and marketing  general and administrative expenses as a result of activities related to our amd geode products and other product development 
manufacturing costs increased primarily because we manufactured more amd geode products  which generally are more expensive to manufacture than our other embedded processors 
pcs operating loss of million in improved compared to the operating loss of million in the improvement was primarily due to sales of million of certain embedded microprocessors and networking products that had been previously written off 
all other category there were no net sales generated in the all other category in or all other net sales of zero in decreased from million in due to the discontinuation of our foundry services in all other operating loss of million in increased from million in  primarily due to an increase of approximately million in corporate bonus and profit sharing expense 
in addition  all other operating loss in included approximately million of restructuring and other special charges  while in we had a million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge 
all other operating loss of million in improved by million compared to an operating loss of million in  primarily due to million of restructuring and other special charges included in the all other category for  compared to a million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge in comparison of gross margin  expenses  interest income and other  net  interest expense and taxes the following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for  and in millions except for percentages cost of sales gross margin research and development expense marketing  general and administrative expense restructuring and other special charges recoveries  net interest income and other  net interest expense income tax provision gross margin percentage increased to percent in compared to percent in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of percent and lower unit manufacturing costs resulting from our transition to smaller  more cost efficient  manufacturing process technologies for both of our microprocessors and flash memory products 
further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of spansion s operating results as of june  gross margin percentage increased to percent in compared to percent in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of percent  accompanied by an increase in cost of sales of only ten percent 
our cost of sales increased at a lower rate than net sales primarily due to cost reductions from the restructuring plan and other cost reduction initiatives 
in addition  microprocessor unit sales 
table of contents increased percent while average selling prices of microprocessor products decreased by four percent  and we realized revenues of million  or approximately two gross margin percentage points  from the sale of microprocessor products that had been previously written off 
further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of spansion s operating results as of june  we amortize capital grants and allowances  interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the state of saxony and the federal republic of germany for fab as they are earned 
the amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as a credit to research and development expenses and cost of sales 
the credit to cost of sales totaled million in  million in and million in research and development expenses of million in increased ten percent from million in due in part to higher research and development expenses as result of the consolidation of spansion s results of operation  an increase in start up costs of approximately million associated with the fab project and a million increase in silicon design related to future generations of our microprocessors 
these factors were partially offset by a million decrease in fab research and development activities 
research and development expenses of million in increased four percent from million in  due in part to higher research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of spansion s results of operation  million in research and development efforts related to new microprocessors  and million paid to ibm to jointly develop new process technologies for use in future microprocessor products 
the increases in research and development expenses were offset by a million reduction in research and development costs  primarily due to the reduction of research and development activities associated with our pcs products and the absence of the million charge representing amounts paid to ibm in in exchange for consulting services relating to optimizing the performance of our manufacturing processes 
we amortize capital grants and allowances  interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that we receive from the state of saxony and the federal republic of germany for fab as they are earned 
the amortization of these grants and subsidies is recognized as a credit to research and development expenses and cost of sales 
the credit to research and development expenses totaled million in  million in and million in marketing  general and administrative expenses of million in increased percent compared to million in  primarily due to increased sales and cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of million primarily associated with our amd based processors  expenses from spansion of million for months of compared to million for six months in and new regulatory compliance costs of million 
marketing  general and administrative expenses of million in decreased percent compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of million and cost reductions from the restructuring plan and other cost reduction initiatives 
effects of restructuring plan in december  we began implementing a restructuring plan the restructuring plan to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory 
as part of this plan  and as a result of our agreement with ibm to jointly develop future generations of our microprocessor manufacturing process technology  we ceased microprocessor related research and development in the sdc and eliminated most of the related resources  including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the sdc 

table of contents the restructuring plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities  primarily at our sunnyvale  california site and at sales offices worldwide 
we vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities currently occupied under long term operating leases through we also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning erp software and other information technology implementation activities  resulting in the abandonment of certain software  hardware and capitalized development costs 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of million in the fourth quarter of  consisting primarily of million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs  an asset impairment charge of million relating to a license that has no future use because of its association with discontinued microprocessor development activities  asset impairment charges of million resulting from the abandonment of equipment previously used in microprocessor process development and manufacturing activities  anticipated exit costs of million almost wholly related to vacating and consolidating our facilities and a charge of million resulting from the abandonment of partially completed erp software and other information technology implementation activities 
during  management approved the sale of additional equipment primarily used in the sdc that was identified as no longer useful in our operations 
as a result  we recorded approximately million of asset impairment charges in the first quarter of  including million of charges for decommission costs necessary to complete the sale of the equipment 
during  we also revised our estimates of the number of positions to be eliminated pursuant to the restructuring plan from  to  in response to the additional resources required due to the spansion transaction 
as a result  we reversed million of the estimated severance and fringe benefit accrual 
as of december    employees had been terminated pursuant to the restructuring plan resulting in cumulative cash payments of million in severance and employee benefit costs 
during  we adjusted the restructuring accrual related to the restructuring plan  which resulted in an additional million restructuring charge for the period 
the adjustment was primarily related to a change in our estimate of potential sublease opportunities associated with abandoned facilities located in sunnyvale  california 
with the exception of exit costs consisting primarily of remaining lease payments on abandoned facilities net of estimated sublease income that are payable through  we have completed the activities associated with the restructuring plan 
with the formation of spansion and other business changes  we no longer track the overall cost savings from the restructuring plan because we do not believe this information would be useful 

table of contents the following table summarizes activities under the restructuring plan through december  severance and employee benefits asset impairment exit and equipment decommission costs other restructuring charges total in thousands provision non cash charges cash charges accruals at december  provision cash charges non cash charges non cash adjustments accruals at december  cash charges non cash adjustments accruals at december  effects of restructuring plan in  in response to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry and a resulting decline in revenues  we implemented a restructuring plan the restructuring plan 
we completed our execution of the restructuring plan as of december  during  we reduced the estimated accrual of the facility and equipment decommission costs by million based on the most current information available and we realized a recovery of approximately million for the excess of the sale price over the estimated fair value of equipment that we determined was impaired as a result of the restructuring plan 
both amounts were included in restructuring and other special charges recoveries  net 
with the formation of spansion and other business changes  we no longer track the overall cost savings from this restructuring plan because we do not believe the information would be useful 
the following table summarizes activity under the restructuring plan from december  through december  severance and employee benefits facilities and equipment decommission costs other facilities exit costs total in thousands accruals at december  cash charges accruals at december  non cash adjustments cash charges accruals at december  cash charges non cash adjustments accruals at december  
table of contents interest income and other  net we recorded a net charge of interest income and other  net of million in compared to interest income and other  net of approximately million in this charge was due primarily to a charge of approximately million related to a series of transactions pursuant to which we exchanged million of our convertible senior notes due the notes for our common stock 
the charge represented the difference between the fair value of the common stock issued in the transactions and the fair value of common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the notes 
in addition  interest income and other  net  in included a charge of approximately million in connection with our prepayment of the dresden term loan  and a loss of approximately million during the second quarter of resulting from the mark to market of certain foreign currency forward contracts that we used as economic hedges of forecasted capital contributions to amd fab kg  which do not qualify as accounting hedges 
interest income and other  net  of approximately million in decreased percent from million in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment income of million caused by lower cash equivalents and short term investment balances and a charge of million in for other than temporary declines in our equity investments 
this decrease was offset by a gain of approximately million based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of assets contributed by us to spansion 
fujitsu now owns a percent interest in these assets 
the gain on the deemed sale of these assets to spansion was limited to the difference in carrying value of our interest in the assets following the completion of the transaction and the carrying value of the assets immediately prior to the transaction 
interest expense interest expense of million in was flat compared to million in on october   we sold million of senior notes due the notes 
interest accrued on the notes was partially offset by the absence of interest expense  as of november   for amounts outstanding under the dresden term loan  which we prepaid on november   and the absence of interest expense with respect to million of our notes  which we exchanged for our common stock in a series of transactions during the fourth quarter of we also capitalized interest during of million in connection with our fab construction activities in dresden  germany 
interest expense of million in increased percent compared to million in the increase was due primarily to annual interest charges of million on our notes sold in november  million of interest on million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and the spansion transaction  which resulted in additional interest expense of approximately million in in addition  in we capitalized interest of million on continued expansion and facilitization of fabs and compared to million in income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in  million in and million in the income tax provision in primarily reflects us income taxes  including taxes on the dividends repatriated from controlled foreign corporations  partially offset by foreign tax benefits because of losses in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax provision in primarily reflected income tax expense generated in certain foreign jurisdictions  offset by a benefit of a us federal tax refund from a carryback claim we filed in the income tax provision was recorded primarily for taxes due on income generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions and the establishment of a valuation allowance against the remainder of our us deferred tax assets  net of us deferred tax liabilities in the fourth quarter  due to continuing substantial operating losses in the united states 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million 
we also had foreign loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had 
table of contents federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against all our net us federal and state deferred tax assets and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets million at december  because of our history of recent losses 
other items international sales as a percent of net sales were percent in  percent in and percent in during and  approximately and percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen  as compared to one percent during the increase in the percentage in and compared to was primarily due to the consolidation of spansion s results of operations  effective june   which include sales by spansion to fujitsu  which are denominated in yen 
our foreign exchange risk exposure resulting from these sales is partially mitigated as a result of our yen denominated manufacturing costs 
in addition  we are subject to foreign currency risk related to our manufacturing costs in fab  which are denominated in euro 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to the euro  but future exchange rate fluctuations may cause increases or decreases to our fab and fab manufacturing costs 
the impact on our operating results from changes in foreign currency rates individually and in the aggregate has not been material  on an annual basis  principally as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  below 
financial condition our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  totaled billion  which included approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of spansion 
spansion s operating agreement governs its ability to use this cash for operations or to distribute it to us and fujitsu 
pursuant to the operating agreement  and subject to restrictions contained in third party loan agreements  spansion must first distribute any cash balance to us and fujitsu in an amount sufficient to cover each party s estimated tax liability  if any  related to spansion s taxable income for each fiscal year 
any remaining cash balance after the tax liability distribution would be used by spansion to fund its operations in accordance with its budget 
if any cash remains  it must be used to repay spansion s outstanding debt to us and fujitsu 
any remaining cash may be distributed at the discretion of spansion s board of managers  to us and fujitsu  pro rata  based on each party s membership interest at the time of distribution  which currently is percent and percent 
due to our repayment of amounts outstanding under the dresden term loan on november  and the related termination of the dresden loan agreements effective december   we are no longer required to maintain a compensating cash balance 
therefore  as of december   our compensating cash balance was zero as compared to million as of december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was approximately billion in net income of million  non cash charges  consisting primarily of billion of depreciation and amortization expense and a million charge associated with our exchange of million of our notes for common stock  contributed to the positive cash flows from operations 
the net changes in operating assets in as compared to included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales  and increased inventories due primarily to an increase in microprocessor inventories resulting from a higher percentage of amd based processors and improved market conditions 
for fiscal  fujitsu accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated accounts receivable and approximately percent of our consolidated gross sales 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in although we had a net loss of million for the year  adjustments for non cash charges  which were primarily depreciation and 
table of contents amortization  resulted in a positive cash flow from operations 
the net changes in operating assets in as compared to included an increase in accounts receivable due to higher net sales and the consolidation of spansion s results of operations  which include spansion s sales to fujitsu  and an increase in net inventory due to the consolidation of spansion s results of operations 
for fiscal  fujitsu accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated accounts receivable and approximately percent of our consolidated gross sales 
in  the net changes in payables and accrued liabilities primarily included payments of million for a technology license from ibm and approximately million of payments under the restructuring plan 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  primarily as a result of our net loss of billion  adjusted by non cash charges 
changes in operating assets and liabilities in as compared to were attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a percent decrease in net sales

each accounting period  we increase the carrying value of this debt towards our ultimate redemption value of the silent partnership contributions by the guaranteed annual rate of return of between percent to percent 
we classify this periodic accretion to redemption value as interest expense 
the limited partnership contributions that amd fab kg expects to receive from leipziger messe and fab beteiligungs are subject to the put and call provisions referenced above 
these contributions are not mandatorily redeemable  but rather are subject to redemption outside of the control of amd fab holding and amd fab admin 
upon consolidation  we initially record these contributions as minority interest  based on their fair value 
each accounting period  we increase the carrying value of this minority interest toward our ultimate redemption value of these contributions by the guaranteed rate of return of between percent and percent 
we classify this periodic accretion of redemption value as an additional minority interest allocation

table of contents under the fab loan agreements  amd fab kg  amd fab holding and amd fab admin are generally prevented from paying dividends or making other payments to us 
in addition  amd fab kg would be in default under the fab loan agreements if we or any of the amd companies fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if  after the occurrence of the event  the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is adversely affected 
circumstances that could result in a default include failure of any limited partner to make contributions to amd fab kg as required under the partnership agreements or our failure to provide loans to amd fab kg as required under the fab loan agreements  failure to pay any amount due under the fab loan agreements within five days of the due date  occurrence of any event which the lenders reasonably believe has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business  assets or condition of amd fab kg or amd or their ability to perform under the fab loan agreements  filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us  amd fab kg or any limited partner  occurrence of a change in control as defined in the fab loan agreements of amd  amd fab kg s noncompliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on payment of profits  dividends or other distributions except in limited circumstances and restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness  disposing of assets and repaying subordinated debt  and amd fab kg s noncompliance with certain financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  minimum interest cover ratio  loan to fixed asset value ratio and a minimum cash covenant 
in general  any default with respect to other indebtedness of amd or amd fab kg that is not cured  would result in a cross default under the fab loan agreements 
the occurrence of a default under the fab loan agreements would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the fab loan agreements 
in addition  the occurrence of a default under these agreements could result in a cross default under our loan agreements  including the indentures governing our debentures  notes and notes 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations 
any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us

under the terms of the revolving renminbi rmb loan agreement  spansion china can borrow up to rmb million approximately million as of december  
the interest rate on the us dollar denominated loans is libor plus one percent and the interest rate on the rmb denominated loans is fixed at percent 
the maximum term of each loan is months from the date of each drawdown 
as of december   spansion china had fully drawn on the loans 

table of contents capital lease obligations as of december   we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of approximately million 
obligations under these lease agreements are collateralized by the assets leased and are payable through leased assets consist principally of machinery and equipment 
we guaranteed approximately million of spansion s and its subsidiaries aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations as of december  operating leases we lease certain of our facilities  including our executive offices in sunnyvale  california  and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built  under lease agreements that expire at various dates through we lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years 
total future lease obligations as of december   were approximately million  of which million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our restructuring plan 
unconditional purchase commitments total non cancelable purchase commitments as of december   were approximately billion for periods through these purchase commitments include approximately million related to contractual obligations to purchase energy and gas for fab and fab and million representing future payments to ibm pursuant to the joint development agreement 
as ibm s services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement  we expense the payments as incurred 
our non cancelable purchase commitments also include approximately million to m w zander for the design and construction of fab and other related services 
these payments will be made to m w zander as services are performed 
in addition  unconditional purchase commitments also include approximately million for software maintenance agreements that require periodic payments through as a result  we have not recorded any liabilities relating to these agreements 
the remaining commitments primarily consist of non cancelable contractual obligations to purchase raw materials  natural resources and office supplies 
purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable without significant penalties are not included in the amount set forth in the table above 
other long term liabilities the only component of other long term liabilities that requires us to make cash payments is a net restructuring accrual of approximately million relating to the net future operating lease payments on certain facilities that were included in our restructuring plan 
we will make these payments through we included these amounts in the operating lease total in the table above 
the other components of other long term liabilities do not require us to make cash payments and primarily consist of approximately million of deferred grants and subsidies related to the fab and fab projects and a million deferred gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of our corporate marketing  general and administrative facility in sunnyvale  california in repayment of dresden term loan amd saxony  our indirect  wholly owned german subsidiary  continues to facilitize fab  which began production in the second quarter of amd  the federal republic of germany  the state of saxony and a consortium of banks provided financing for the fab project 
we currently estimate that the construction and facilitization costs of fab will be billion when it is fully equipped by the end of as of december   we had invested approximately billion in the fab project 
in march  amd saxony entered into a loan agreement and other related agreements the dresden loan agreements with a consortium of banks led by dresdner bank ag  a german financial institution  in order to finance the project 
on november   amd saxony prepaid the full amount outstanding under the dresden term loan plus accrued and unpaid interest and a prepayment premium  and the dresden term loan 
table of contents and related security agreements were terminated effective december  we recognized a charge of approximately million included in interest income and other  net associated with the prepayment of the dresden term loan  which included the prepayment premium of approximately million and write off of remaining capitalized financing costs of approximately million 
also in march  amd saxony entered into a subsidy agreement with the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony in support of the fab project 
under this agreement  the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony agreed to provide guarantees equal to percent of the amount outstanding under the dresden term loan  which was zero as of december   capital investment grants and allowances totaling up to approximately million as of december   and interest subsidies totaling million as of december  of these amounts  amd saxony received approximately million in capital investment grants and allowances and million in interest subsidies through december  amd saxony also received million in research and development subsidies through december  amounts received under the subsidy agreement are recorded as a long term liability on our financial statements and are amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the subsidy agreement as a reduction to operating expenses 
as of december   these amounts were being amortized ratably through december amd saxony has received substantially all investment grants and allowances and interest subsidies to which it is entitled 
noncompliance with the conditions of the grants  allowances and subsidies contained in the subsidy agreement could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received  as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 
under the original subsidy agreement  amd saxony undertook to attain a certain employee headcount by december and to maintain such headcount until december in april  the german governmental authorities advised amd saxony that rather than maintaining employee headcount attained by december through december  it would be required to maintain employee headcount attained as of december through december beginning in april  we adjusted the quarterly amortization of the grants and allowances until december in december  amd saxony reduced its anticipated employment levels as a result of the restructuring plan 
consequently  as of december   headcount was below the level agreed to by amd saxony at which amd saxony would be entitled to receive the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available 
although the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available under the subsidy agreement was reduced from million to approximately million  this reduction did not result in a repayment of capital investment grants and allowances already received 
we adjusted the quarterly amortization of these amounts accordingly 
sachsische aufbaubank gmbh  the sab an entity acting on behalf of the free state of saxony  requested that amd saxony exchange investment grants that it had previously received in the amount of approximately million for an equivalent amount of investment allowances 
amd saxony has agreed to repay these investment grants in amd saxony will receive the corresponding amount of investment allowances from the german tax authorities 
there is no right of setoff between these two amounts because investment grants are co financed by the state of saxony and the federal republic of germany whereas investment allowances are financed only by the federal republic of germany 
accordingly  as of december   we recorded a receivable for the investment allowances and a payable in a corresponding amount for the investment grants 
the receivable and payable are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that the exchange will not have an impact on our operating results and cash flows

this is the amount of silent partnership contributions received by amd fab kg  as of december  from the unaffliated limited partners under the fab partnership agreements 
assuming certain milestones are met by amd fab kg  we expect to receive a total of up to million of silent partnership contributions 
amd fab holding and amd fab admin are required to repurchase each partner s silent partnership contribution in annual installments one year after the partner has contributed the full amount required under the partnership agreements 
we guaranteed these obligations 
as of december   fab beteiligungs had contributed the full amount required under the partnership agreements  but leipziger messe had not contributed the full amount 
therefore  the condition precedent to our repurchase obligations with respect to leipziger messe s silent partnership contribution had not been met

table of contents spansion operating lease guarantees we guaranteed certain operating leases entered into by spansion and its subsidiaries totaling approximately million as of december  the amounts guaranteed are reduced by the lease payments paid by spansion over the lease term 
under the provision of fin  we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees because they are for our subsidiary s performance obligations 
amtc and bac guarantees the advanced mask technology center gmbh co 
kg amtc and maskhouse building administration gmbh co  kg bac are joint ventures formed by us  infineon technologies ag and dupont photomasks  inc for the purpose of constructing and operating an advanced photomask facility in dresden  germany 
the results of operations of amtc  which we account for following the equity method of accounting  are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
to finance the project  bac and amtc entered into a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan in december also in december  in order to occupy the photomask facility  amtc entered into a rental agreement with bac 
with regard to these commitments by bac and amtc  as of december   we guaranteed up to approximately million plus interest and expenses under the revolving loan  and up to approximately million  initially  under the rental agreement 
the obligations under the rental agreement guarantee diminish over time through as the term loan is repaid 
however  under certain circumstances of default by the other tenant of the photomask facility under its rental agreement with bac and certain circumstances of default by more than one joint venture partner under its rental agreement guarantee obligations  the maximum potential amount of our obligations under the rental agreement guarantee is approximately million 
as of december   million was drawn under the revolving credit facility  and million was drawn under the term loan 
we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees because they were issued prior to december   the effective date of fin other financial matters spansion llc 
during the four year period commencing on june   we are obligated to provide spansion with additional funding to finance operations shortfalls  if any 
generally  spansion is first required to seek any required financing from external sources 
however  if such third party financing is not available  we must provide funding to spansion equal to our pro rata ownership interest  which is currently percent 
at this time  we believe that spansion would be able to obtain such external financing when needed 
however  there is no assurance that this will happen and currently we cannot estimate the amount of such additional funding  if any  that we are required to provide during this four year period 
sale leaseback transaction in january  spansion japan entered into a sale and leaseback transaction for certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the amount of approximately billion yen approximately million based on the exchange rate as of december  
as the sales proceeds slightly exceed the net book value of the equipment  there is a minimal deferred gain to be recognized on the sale 
under the agreement  the lease payments will be made in six equal semi annual payments and the lease will terminate on december  at the expiration of the lease term  spansion japan has the option to purchase the equipment at an agreed upon price  which we believe to be a bargain purchase option 
in addition  spansion japan can renew the lease if the lessor and spansion japan both agree upon the renewal terms not later than six months prior to the expiration of the lease term 
during the term of the lease  spansion japan is required to comply with certain financial covenants 

table of contents outlook during the first quarter of  for our computation products segment  we expect net sales to decline slightly compared to the fourth quarter of for our memory products segment  we expect net sales to decline during the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of due to continued imbalance in supply and demand  continued pressure on average selling prices and seasonality 
in fiscal  we expect capital expenditures of approximately billion 
we expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately billion  and research and development expenses  both in total dollars and as a percentage of sales  to increase primarily due to fab start up costs of approximately million 
we also expect total marketing  general and administrative expenses to increase in  but to decline as a percentage of sales 
in  our strategy is to expand our position in the enterprise segment with our amd based processors  to leverage our spansion product portfolio to expand our position in the flash memory market  and to increase the adoption of our mirrorbit technology 
however  economic and industry conditions remain uncertain and continue to make it particularly difficult to forecast product demand 
if economic conditions do not continue to improve in the near term in accordance with our expectations  or if the semiconductor industry experiences a significant downturn  our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected 
supplementary stock based incentive compensation disclosures section i 
option program description our stock option programs are intended to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified employees 
on april   our stockholders approved the equity incentive plan the plan  which had previously been approved by our board of directors 
stock options available for grant under our equity compensation plans that were in effect before april   the prior plans  including those that were not approved by our stockholders  were consolidated into the plan 
as of april   equity awards are made only from the plan 
under our prior plans key employees generally were  and under the plan key employees generally are  granted nonqualified stock options nsos to purchase our common stock 
generally  options vest and become exercisable over a four year period from the date of grant and expire five to ten years after the date of grant 
any incentive stock options isos granted under the prior plans or the plan have exercise prices of not less than percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
exercise prices of nsos range from to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
under the plan  we have also granted awards of restricted stock 
the purchase price for an award of restricted stock is per share

the offer to exchange expired on july  options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock were tendered for exchange and cancelled on july  on january   we granted options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price that represented the closing price of our common stock on that date  in exchange for options cancelled 
we did not record compensation expense as a result of the exchange 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r eliminates our ability to use the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires a public entity to reflect on its income statement  instead of pro forma disclosures in its financial footnotes  the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those equity instruments 
among other things  sfas r also requires entities to estimate the number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered and  if the terms or conditions of an equity award are modified after the grant date  to recognize incremental compensation cost for such a modification by comparing the fair value of the modified award with the fair value of the award immediately before the modification 
in addition  sfas r amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
sfas r is effective generally for public companies as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under the original statement will apply this revised statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under the original statement for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  those entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by the original statement we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and will adopt this statement at the effective date 
although we cannot estimate the exact amount at this time  we expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents risk factors if we cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing  we may be unable to make all of our planned capital expenditures or fulfill our obligations to fab or spansion 
our ability to fund capital expenditures in accordance with our business plan depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing 
in  we plan to make approximately billion in capital expenditures 
moreover  under the partnership agreement for amd fab kg  our german subsidiaries  amd fab holding and amd fab admin are obligated to invest approximately million into amd fab kg 
in addition  under the revolving credit agreement among amd  amd fab holding and amd fab kg  we or amd fab holding are required to provide up to approximately billion to amd fab kg 
loans provided to amd fab kg under this revolving credit agreement are unsecured and subordinated to the rights of the consortium of banks that will also be providing financing to amd fab kg 
we are also obligated through june  to provide spansion with additional funding to finance operational cash flow needs 
generally  spansion must seek any required financing from external sources 
however  if third party financing is not available  either on a non recourse basis to us or with guarantees based on our pro rata ownership interest  we must provide funding to spansion equal to our pro rata ownership interest in spansion  which is currently percent 
an inability to meet our funding obligations for spansion could  among other things  result in additional equity in spansion being issued to fujitsu or third parties  which would reduce our ownership in and control over spansion 
our capital expenditures  together with ongoing operating expenses  will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances 
the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for products  product mix  changes in semiconductor industry conditions and market competition 
we regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities  including debt and equity 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
our inability to obtain needed debt and or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures 
if we curtail capital expenditures or abandon projects  we could be materially adversely affected 
for example  if we abandon the fab project  we will have to write off related costs that we capitalized and we will be required to continue to make payments or otherwise be liable pursuant to then existing contracts that we cannot terminate at will or without significant penalties 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position 
as of december   we had consolidated debt of approximately billion 
in addition  we guaranteed approximately million of obligations  which are not reflected on our balance sheet 
our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including making scheduled principal and interest payments  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes  limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and industry  
table of contents place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt  including secured debt  in the future 
subject to the restrictions in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional debt  including secured debt  in the future 
in particular  as of december   we and our subsidiaries would have had the following additional borrowings available up to million under our revolving credit facility 
amounts borrowed under this facility are secured by all of our accounts receivable  inventory  general intangibles excluding intellectual property and the related proceeds  excluding spansion s accounts receivable  inventory and general intangibles 
spansion japan had up to billion yen approximately million as of december  available under a revolving credit facility 
amd fab kg will have the ability  subject to achieving certain milestones  to borrow up to million based on an exchange rate of euro to one us dollar as of december  from a consortium of banks under the fab loan agreements during and although the terms of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions  and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt  or our guarantees of other parties debts  will depend on our financial and operating performance  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt  or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise  we may be required to sell assets or equity  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt  sell assets or equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
the indentures governing our notes  debentures and notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make other restricted payments  make certain investments  including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries  create or permit certain liens  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  use the proceeds from sales of assets  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  and 
table of contents consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety 
in addition the guarantees associated with the fab loan agreements contain restrictive covenants  including a prohibition on the ability of amd fab kg and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments  and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts 
our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants  including a prohibition on our ability to pay dividends  and also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when our net domestic cash is below specified amounts 
the july spansion term loan  as amended  contains restrictive covenants  including a prohibition on spansion s ability to pay dividends and also requires spansion to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when its net domestic cash or its net worldwide cash is below specified amounts 
our ability to satisfy the covenants  financial ratios and tests of our debt instruments can be affected by events beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements 
a breach of any of these covenants  financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the applicable agreement 
in addition  our agreements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreements covering other borrowings 
for example  the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness that results in acceleration of the maturity date or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of million would cause a cross default under the indenture governing our notes 
similarly  a default with respect to any indebtedness in excess of million would cause a cross default under the indentures governing our debentures and notes 
the occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable and would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
we have granted a security interest in substantially all of our inventory and accounts receivable under our revolving credit facility  and in certain property  plant and equipment under the july spansion term loan agreement 
if the lenders under any of the credit facilities or the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our debentures  notes and notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness 
if we lose microsoft corporation s support for our products  or if there is a significant delay in microsoft s release of an operating system that works with our amd technology  our ability to sell our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to innovate beyond the x instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products 
if microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x instruction sets  including the timely introduction of an operating system that works with our amd technology  independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase pcs with our microprocessors 
if we fail to retain the support of microsoft  our ability to market our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected 
in july  microsoft announced a delay in the release of its windows server service pack  windows server for bit extended systems and windows xp bit for bit extended systems 
the new windows editions are designed to take advantage of bit extensions to the standard x instruction set 
microsoft estimated that the release of this software will occur in the first half of previously  microsoft 
table of contents estimated the release date for this software would be in late this delay could adversely impact the timing of development of bit applications by independent software providers and the adoption of bit computing by end users 
as a result  this delay could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our amd based processors 
we must achieve further market acceptance of our bit technology  amd  or we will be materially adversely affected 
we designed our amd based processors to provide users with the ability to take advantage of bit applications while preserving their ability to run existing bit applications on servers and workstations and on desktop and mobile pcs 
market acceptance of these processors is subject to risks and uncertainties including the support of operating system and application program providers for our bit instruction set  including timely development of bit applications  the willingness of users to purchase products with bit capability prior to the availability of operating systems and software applications that take full advantage of our amd technology  our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner on advanced process technologies  in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers  and the availability  performance and feature set of motherboards  memory and chipsets designed for these processors 
if we are unable to achieve further market acceptance of our amd technology  we will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive 
we make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading edge microprocessors 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop  or obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive 
for example  we have a joint development agreement with ibm  pursuant to which we work together to develop new process technologies 
in september  we amended this agreement and extended its termination date from december to december under this amended agreement  we anticipate that from december  through december  we would pay fees to ibm of between approximately million and million in connection with joint development projects 
in addition  from the beginning of through december   we paid approximately million to ibm in connection with agreements and services related to license grants and research and development activities 
if this agreement were to be terminated  we would either have to resume research and development activities for microprocessors internally or find an alternative partner 
in either case  our research and development costs could increase  and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies  any of which could materially adversely affect us 
moreover  the successful and timely development and implementation of silicon on insulator technology and the achievement of other milestones set forth in the joint development agreement are critical to our amd based processors and to our ability to commence operations at fab in accordance with our planned schedule 

table of contents the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected  and may in the future materially adversely affect  our business 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with maturing product cycles  manufacturing overcapacity and declines in general economic conditions 
our historical financial results have also been subject to substantial fluctuations 
our financial performance has been  and may in the future be  negatively affected by these downturns 
we incurred substantial losses in recent downturns  due to the cyclical nature of supply demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry  a decline in demand for end user products that incorporate our semiconductors  excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution  including our customers  excess production capacity  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
for example  in and  we implemented restructuring plans due to weak customer demand associated with the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
similarly  in the fourth quarter of  the downturn in the flash memory market contributed to a decline in our memory product net sales 
if these conditions in the semiconductor industry occur  we could be materially adversely affected 
fluctuations in demand for pcs and mobile telephones and other consumer electronics may adversely affect sales of our products 
the computation products segment of our business is dependent upon the market for computers  including pcs 
industry wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future 
depending on the growth rate of computers sold  sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease 
if end user demand for computers is below our expectations  we could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from intel corporation  such as dell  inc  could further materially adversely affect us 
the memory products segment of our business is dependent to a large degree upon demand for mobile telephones as well as consumer electronics  automotive electronics and other embedded applications 
if demand for these devices is below our expectations or if the manufacturers of successive generations of these devices do not require nor based flash memory products or increasing flash memory content  we could be materially adversely affected 
intense competition in the microprocessor and flash memory markets could materially adversely affect us 
the ic industry is intensely competitive 
with respect to our microprocessor products  our competitor is intel 
microprocessor products compete on performance  quality  reliability  price  adherence to industry standards  software and hardware compatibility  marketing and distribution capability  brand recognition and availability 
after a product is introduced  costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves  and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale 
we may not be able to compete effectively if we fail to reduce our costs on existing products or fail to develop and introduce  on a cost effective and timely basis  new products or enhanced versions of existing products with higher margins 
our principal competitors in the flash memory market are intel  samsung  toshiba  stmicroelectronics nv  sharp electronics corporation  silicon storage technology and macronix international 
the flash memory market is characterized by migration to higher density and lower cost devices and a competitive pricing 
table of contents environment 
in addition  ample capacity for manufacturing flash memory products exists due to recent capital investment by some of our competitors  which is likely to further contribute to a competitive pricing environment 
in the past  including the second half of  the net increases of supply  meaning the difference of capacity additions less capacity reductions due to obsolescence  exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry 
in the second half of  fluctuations in the rate at which industry capacity grew relative to the growth rate in demand for flash memory products  particularly nor based products  contributed to a decrease in our average selling prices and hurt our results of operations 
if this continues in the future we would be materially adversely affected 
to compete successfully  we must transition to technologies that meet the increasing demand for higher flash memory content in mobile phones  consumer electronics and automotive applications  among other markets  at competitive prices 
we expect competition in the flash memory market to increase as existing manufacturers introduce new products  new manufacturers enter the market  industry wide production capacity increases  to the extent potential customers choose nand based products over nor based products and competitors aggressively price their flash memory products 
in addition  we and certain of our competitors have licensed non volatile memory technology called nrom technology from a third party 
nrom technology allows memory devices to store two bits of data in a memory cell 
nrom technology has similar characteristics to our mirrorbit technology  which may allow these competitors to develop flash memory technology that is competitive with mirrorbit technology 
intel corporation s dominance of the microprocessor market  its position in the flash memory market and its business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively 
intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in desktop and mobile pcs for many years 
intel is also a dominant competitor in the server segment of the microprocessor market and a significant competitor in the flash memory market 
intel s significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively  to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives  and to discipline customers who do business with us 
these aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products  particularly microprocessors and flash memory products  and adversely affect our margins and profitability 
as long as intel remains in this dominant position  we may be materially adversely affected by intel s pricing and allocation strategies and actions  including aggressive pricing for flash memory products and microprocessors to increase market share  product mix and introduction schedules  product bundling  marketing and merchandising strategies  exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers  control over industry standards  pc manufacturers and other pc industry participants  including motherboard  memory  chipset and basic input output system  or bios  suppliers  and strong brand  and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of the brand 
for example  with respect to the microprocessor market  intel exerts substantial influence over pc manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the intel inside brand program and other marketing programs 
because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market  intel has been able to control x microprocessor and pc system standards and dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of intel s competitors 
intel also dominates the pc system platform  which includes core logic chipsets  graphics chips  motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a pc system 
as a result  pc oems are highly dependent on intel  less innovative on their own and  to a large extent  are distributors of intel technology 
additionally  intel is able to drive de facto standards for x microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards 
in marketing our microprocessors to oems  we depend on 
table of contents third party companies other than intel for the design and manufacture of core logic chipsets  graphics chips  motherboards  bios software and other components 
in recent years  many of these third party designers and manufacturers have lost significant market share to intel or exited the business 
in addition  intel has significant leverage over these companies because they support each new generation of intel s microprocessors 
we do not currently plan to develop microprocessors that are bus interface protocol compatible with intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with intel does not extend to intel s proprietary bus interface protocol 
thus  our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessors 
our ability to compete with intel in the market for microprocessors will depend on our continued success in developing and maintaining relationships with infrastructure providers in order to ensure that these third party designers and manufacturers of motherboards  chipsets and other system components support our microprocessor offerings  particularly amd based microprocessors 
a failure of the designers and manufacturers of motherboards  chipsets and other system components to support our microprocessor offerings  particularly our amd based microprocessors  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we expect intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market  to continue to be a significant competitor in the flash memory market and to continue to invest heavily in research and development  new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies 
intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do 
we also expect competition from intel to increase to the extent intel reduces prices on its microprocessor and or flash memory products and introduces new competitive products 
for example  in intel introduced a bit processor for servers and workstations that runs existing bit software applications 
this processor competes with our amd opteron microprocessor 
in addition  intel recently announced that it will offer dual core bit processors for the desktop market in the second quarter of moreover  intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on millimeter wafers using nanometer process technology  which can result in products that are higher performing  use less power and cost less to manufacture 
we are currently completing our transition to nanometer process technology for microprocessor manufacturing  and we expect to transition to millimeter wafers in to the extent intel manufactures its microprocessor products on larger wafers and smaller process technologies earlier than we do  we may be more vulnerable to intel s aggressive pricing strategies for microprocessor products 
intel s dominant position in the microprocessor market  its existing relationships with top tier oems and its aggressive pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us 
collectively  our top five oem and distributor customers including fujitsu accounted for approximately percent of our total gross revenues in in addition  our flash memory product sales growth is dependent to a large extent on demand for high end mobile telephones and our sales in the wireless market have been concentrated in a limited group of customers 
if we were to lose a significant customer  or if one of our top customers downsizes or otherwise contracts its operations  demand for our products could decrease and we would be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to keep pace with new product designs and improvements or if we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted  customers may not buy our products and we may be adversely affected 
our success depends to a significant extent on the development  qualification  implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers 
our ability to develop and qualify such products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements and at prices acceptable to our customers are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets 
if we are delayed in developing or qualifying new technologies  we could be materially adversely affected 
for 
table of contents example  during the second half of we experienced a delay in qualifying a new spansion flash memory product for the wireless segment 
this delay contributed to lower than anticipated flash memory product revenues for the quarter ended december  qualifying this product in accordance with our specifications and our revised schedule is critical to our ability to increase sales of our memory products segment 
in addition  we plan to introduce our dual core microprocessors for servers and workstations in mid  followed by dual processors for the pc market in the second half of if we are not able to introduce dual core processors on a timely basis or if our dual core processors do not achieve market acceptance  we will be materially adversely affected 
a lack of market acceptance of mirrorbit technology could have a material adverse effect on us 
we believe that market acceptance of mirrorbit technology is a critical factor impacting our ability to increase flash memory product revenues and market share and decrease the cost of products in our memory products segment 
mirrorbit technology is a memory cell architecture that enables flash memory products to store two bits of data in a single memory cell thereby doubling the density or storage capacity of each memory cell 
a lack of continued market acceptance of mirrorbit technology  adoption of such technology at a slower rate than we anticipate  or any substantial difficulty in transitioning flash memory products  including those based on mirrorbit technology  to any future process technology could reduce our ability to be competitive in the market 
spansion flash memory products are based on nor architecture  and a significant market shift to nand architecture could materially adversely affect us 
flash memory products are generally based on either nor architecture or nand architecture 
nand has historically been the preferred architecture for data storage because of attributes such as high densities and fast write and erase speeds 
nor has been the preferred architecture for code storage because of its fast read performance and superior reliability 
to date  our flash memory products have been based on nor architecture  and we do not manufacture products based on nand architecture 
during and  industry sales of products based on nand architecture grew at higher rates than sales of nor based products 
this resulted in nand vendors gaining a greater share of the overall flash memory market 
as mobile telephones and other consumer driven applications become more advanced they will require higher density flash memory to meet increased data storage requirements 
because storage requirements will increase to accommodate data intensive applications  customers may increasingly choose nand based products 
any significant shift in the marketplace to products based on nand architecture or other architectures may reduce the total market available to us and therefore reduce our revenues and market share 
we intend to address end markets traditionally served by nand based products with products based on our ornand architecture 
we are currently developing these products and if they  or any future products based on our mirrorbit technology and ornand architecture  fail to achieve acceptance in markets traditionally served by nand architecture  or at all  we could be materially adversely affected 
we are required to reach agreement with fujitsu regarding certain actions of our majority owned subsidiary  spansion  and our interests may not be aligned 
we own percent of the equity interest in spansion while fujitsu owns the remaining percent 
although we are entitled to appoint a majority of the board of managers  which generally manages the affairs of spansion  certain actions by spansion require fujitsu s consent for as long as fujitsu maintains specific levels of equity ownership in spansion 
in addition  based upon designated thresholds of fujitsu s percentage interest in spansion  certain actions require the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the managers appointed by fujitsu 
these actions  which primarily represent protective rights for fujitsu as a minority member  include major investments  acquisitions and dispositions of assets  
table of contents a merger or consolidation resulting in the transfer of more than of the equity interests  settlement of major legal proceedings and other actions  approval of certain material contracts between us and spansion  changes to the equity capital structure of the spansion  and winding up spansion or one of its material subsidiaries 
there can be no guarantee that our interests and those of fujitsu will be aligned with respect to such decisions and we may be unable to take steps that we believe are desirable 
in addition  a reduction in our percentage interest may result in our inability to appoint a majority of spansion s board of managers  which could result in the loss of effective control of spansion  although the results of operations of spansion may continue to impact significantly our results of operations and we still may be required to make loans to  and guarantee indebtedness of  spansion 
our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns 
a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter 
this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of net sales for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
in addition  our operating results tend to vary seasonally 
for example  demand in the retail sector of the pc market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season 
european sales are often weaker during the summer months 
many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 
manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may adversely affect us 
there may be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products 
our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties  could have a material adverse effect on us 
at times we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products 
during such times  many of our costs remain fixed and cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period 
we are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by facilitizing fab  transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies and making significant capital investments in our existing manufacturing facilities 
if the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations  we may underutilize manufacturing facilities 
this has in the past had  and in the future may have  a material adverse effect on us 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be materially adversely affected 
manufacturing our products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
we continuously modify manufacturing processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs 
we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  delays in the development of new process technologies  changes in our process technologies  upgrades or expansion of existing facilities  or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process 
we are currently completing the transition to nanometer process technology for our microprocessor products 
in addition  we plan to transition the manufacture of certain flash memory products to nanometer 
table of contents process technology in the second half of during periods when we are implementing new process technologies  manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive 
a substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us  particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
if our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware  we could be materially adversely affected 
our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware 
further  we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner 
if our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume  we could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us 
costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us 
one or more of our products may be found to be defective after the product has been shipped to customers in volume 
the cost of a recall  software fix  product replacements and or product returns may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  modifications needed to fix the defect may impede performance of the product 
if essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products  we could be materially adversely affected 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis 
we purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
because some equipment and material that we purchase is complex  it is sometimes difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another 
in addition  certain raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers 
for example  we are largely dependent on one supplier for our millimeter and millimeter silicon on insulator soi wafers 
although there are alternative sources available  we have not qualified these sources and we do not believe that they currently have sufficient capacity to meet our requirements for soi wafers 
we are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of ic packages we purchase 
similarly  we purchase commercial non flash memory die  such as sram and psram  from third party suppliers and incorporate these die into spansion mcp products 
some of these suppliers are also our competitors in the flash memory market 
interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 
if we are unable to procure certain of these materials  we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations 
such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on us 
our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs 
our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales and executive personnel 
if we are not able to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business  the progress of our product development programs could be hindered  and we could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we outsource to third parties certain supply chain logistics functions  including physical distribution of our products  and co source some information technology services 
we rely on a third party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for our manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we rely on a third party provider in india to provide certain information technology services to us  including helpdesk support  desktop application services  business and software support applications  server and storage administration  data center operations  database administration  and voice  video and remote access 
our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts 
we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms  in which case our internal operations  the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for our facilities could be materially adversely affected 
also  we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed  in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  we decided to outsource or co source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and to create a more variable cost structure 
however  if the costs related to administration  communication and coordination of these third party providers are greater than we expect  then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could materially adversely affect us 
sales of our products are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders 
we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our microprocessor customers 
from time to time  we enter into long term supply arrangements with our flash memory customers 
generally  our customers may cancel orders days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty 
we base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products  which are difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory 
because market conditions are uncertain  these and other factors could materially adversely affect us 
our reliance on third party distributors subjects us to certain risks 
we market and sell our products directly and through third party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party 
in addition  these agreements are non exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors products 
in  one of our distributors  avnet  accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated gross sales 
in addition  fujitsu accounted for approximately percent of our consolidated gross sales in fujitsu primarily distributes spansion flash memory products 
accordingly  we are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts 
if any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors products over our products  our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products 
in most instances  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions  as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book or that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date 
in addition  some agreements with our distributors contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns 
we defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors  resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs  until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors 
however  in the event of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products  the price 
table of contents protection rights we offer to our distributors could materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline 
our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy  we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets 
our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated net sales were approximately percent and percent in and nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products are performed at manufacturing facilities in china  malaysia  singapore and thailand 
we manufacture our microprocessors in germany and certain spansion flash memory products are manufactured in japan 
we also depend on foreign foundry suppliers for the production of certain of our embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and we depend on an international joint venture for the manufacture of optical photomasks that we intend to use in the manufacture of our microprocessors 
the political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include  without limitation expropriation  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  difficulty in protecting our intellectual property  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions  changes in freight and interest rates  disruption in air transportation between the united states and our overseas facilities  and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs 
any of the above events could have a material adverse effect on us 
worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products 
the last economic slowdown in the united states and worldwide adversely affected demand for our products 
although economic conditions have improved since the second half of  another decline in the worldwide semiconductor market or a future decline in economic conditions or consumer confidence in any significant geographic area would likely decrease the overall demand for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
for example  china s economy has been growing at a fast pace over the past several years  and chinese authorities have recently introduced various measures to slow down the pace of economic growth 
for example  during the third quarter of  decreased demand from the wireless handset market in asia  in part due to channel inventory accumulation by wireless handset oems in china  contributed to a decline in memory products net sales 
if chinese authorities are not able to stage an orderly slowdown  china s economy could be affected 
if economic conditions decline  whether in china or worldwide  we could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the middle east have in the past  and may in the future  adversely affect demand for our products 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations directly or indirectly and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive  ultimately affecting our sales 

table of contents also as a result of terrorism  the united states has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales  our supply chain and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the united states economy and worldwide financial markets 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities 
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us 
as a result of our foreign operations  we have sales  costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the european union euro and the japanese yen 
for example a significant portion of our manufacturing costs for our microprocessor products is denominated in euro while sales of those products are denominated primarily in us dollars  certain manufacturing costs for our spansion flash memory products are denominated in yen  some fixed asset purchases are denominated in euro and yen  sales of our flash memory products in japan are denominated in yen  and certain costs of our fab project are denominated in euro 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause our us dollar denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
whenever we believe appropriate  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as of december  we had an aggregate of million notional amount of short term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in euro and yen 
however  generally  we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure 
moreover  we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing 
we cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  even where revenues and expenses are matched  we must translate euro and yen denominated results of operations  assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus the euro or yen will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in their original currency 
these transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets  liabilities and shareholders equity 
our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us 
we market and sell our products directly to oems and through authorized third party distributors 
from time to time  our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market 
gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us  thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately 
also  when gray market products enter the market  we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted products  which adversely affects demand for our products 
in addition  our inability to control gray marketing activities could result in customer satisfaction issues  because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel  there is a risk that our customers are 
table of contents buying counterfeit or substandard products  including products that may have been altered  mishandled or damaged  or used products represented as new 
our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us 
if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united states and abroad  through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and other measures  we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses 
we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts  copyrights  patents  trademarks and other common law rights  such as trade secrets  to protect our intellectual property 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the united states and abroad 
any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
furthermore  patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or  if a patent is issued  the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us 
despite our efforts to protect our rights  others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights 
in addition  it is difficult to monitor compliance with  and enforce  our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost effective manner 
we may become a party to intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products 
from time to time  we have been notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights of others 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in the event we cannot obtain a license  we may be prevented from using some technology  which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products  increase the costs of selling some of our products  or damage our reputation 
we could decide  in the alternative  to resort to litigation to challenge such claims 
such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others will always be avoided or successfully concluded 
our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences  including fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing processes  sales limitations  and criminal and civil liabilities 
failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing process  sales limitations  and criminal and civil liabilities 
existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment  to modify product designs  or to incur other expenses associated with compliance with environmental regulations 
any failure to control the use of  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
future litigation proceedings may materially adversely affect us 
from time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions 
litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages 
in addition  future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the 
table of contents attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions  which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions  which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
for example  our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in california and manufacturing facilities for spansion flash memory products are located near major earthquake fault lines in japan 
in the event of a major earthquake  or other natural or manmade disaster  we could experience business interruptions  destruction of facilities and or loss of life  all of which could materially adversely affect us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
in order to reduce this interest rate risk  we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities 
as of december   substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short term investments and consisted primarily of bank notes  short term corporate notes  short term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short term federal agency notes 
the majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term 
we continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate 
we do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
default risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we use proceeds from debt obligations primarily to support general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital needs 
however  we used the net proceeds from the sale of our notes along with existing cash  to prepay the full amount owed by amd saxony under the dresden term loan  including accrued and unpaid interest through the prepayment date and a prepayment premium

as a result of our foreign operations  we have sales  costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the european union euro and the japanese yen 
for example a significant portion of our manufacturing costs for our microprocessor products is denominated in euro while sales of those products are denominated primarily in us dollars  certain manufacturing costs for our spansion flash memory products are denominated in yen  some fixed asset purchases are denominated in euro and yen  sales of our flash memory products in japan are denominated in yen  and certain costs of our fab project are denominated in euro 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause our us dollar denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions 
our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million notional amount of short term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in japanese yen and european union euro outstanding 

table of contents unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended december  were not material 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future 
however  we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
in particular  generally  we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure 
moreover  we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing 
we cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  even where revenues and expenses are matched  we must translate euro and yen denominated results of operations  assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus the euro or yen will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in their original currency 
these transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets  liabilities and shareholders equity
