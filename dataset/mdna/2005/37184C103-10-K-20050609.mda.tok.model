overview our markets we develop and market image processing solutions 
we design  develop and market integrated circuits that receive and process digital video and graphic images 
we also supply reference boards and designs that incorporate our software and proprietary integrated circuits  or chips 
our products are used in large area lcds  such as lcd monitors 
our products are also used in other types of display devices  including lcd tvs  plasma tvs  rear projection tvs  and digital crt tvs 
we generate the majority of our revenue by selling our image processing solutions to the manufacturers of lcd monitors and flat panel tvs 
we outsource the manufacturing of our products to large semiconductor manufacturers  thereby eliminating the need for capital intensive plant and equipment 
our most significant cash operating expense is labor  with our workforce employed in research and development of new products and technologies and in marketing  sales  customer support  and distribution of our products 
our primary target end markets are lcd monitors and flat panel televisions 
we also design products that serve both applications  multi function monitors  where it is difficult to distinguish between a monitor with television capability and a television with a pc input 
both of these display devices often use the same genesis chip 
similarly  we supply certain customers with chips originally designed for an lcd computer monitor that the customer may use in flat panel televisions 
we assist customers in developing their designs 
typically  a tv design will take more time and support from our software and field application engineers than a monitor design  increasing our costs during a customer s pre production period 
the growth in our target markets is limited by the industry s capacity to supply lcd panels or other digital displays 
furthermore  the availability of lcd panels from time to time has been constrained  causing unexpected increases in the cost of lcd panels to our customers  thus resulting in customers rapidly changing their demand expectations for our products 
our products usually represent less than two percent of the average 
table of contents retail cost of a standard flat panel tv  while the cost of the lcd panel within a lcd monitor or flat panel tv represents the majority of the cost of the finished product 
consequently  constraints on availability of lcd panels or increases in panel costs can result in reduced demand for our products  and it is very difficult to accurately predict the availability or cost of lcd panels 
conversely  it is the increase in production volumes of larger size lcd panels in new fabrication facilities coming on line over the next several years that is expected to result in lower cost panels and hence lower average selling prices of end products 
while panel prices have decreased significantly over the last few quarters  the impact of this price decline has not yet been fully reflected at the retail level 
however  we believe retail prices will continue to decline and we expect this to lead to an increase in demand for display controllers 
our industry is very competitive and growth industries like ours tend to attract new entrants 
the lcd monitor industry is highly competitive 
our average selling prices of monitor display controllers  in spite of increased functionality have declined by more than over the past two years 
we expect the flat panel television industry will be as competitive over time 
our strategy is to maintain market leadership through integration of new features and functions and by providing the highest image quality at a cost effective price 
we believe we are able to deliver the desired feature rich image quality through relationships with customers  patented technologies  effective chip design  software capabilities  and customer support 
while maintaining our leadership in image quality and product feature sets  we strive to maximize profitability by reducing product cost through efficient chip design and driving costs down throughout our supply chain 
average selling prices to distributors are typically less than average selling prices to direct customers for similar products 
sales to distributors typically comprise less than of revenues 
average selling prices and product margins of our products are typically highest during the initial months following product introduction and decline over time and as volume increases 
while we primarily market and sell our integrated circuits directly to manufacturers  we also sell finished systems  primarily to the high end home theater market  under the faroudja brand 
these products are generally sold through specialty retail channels and represent a very small portion of our overall revenue 
part of our overall strategy is to develop intellectual property that is used in our integrated circuits 
we have and will continue to defend our intellectual property rights against those companies that may use our technology without the proper authorization 
at times we may enter into agreements that allow customers or other companies to license our patented technology 
revenue recognition genesis recognizes revenue from semiconductor product sales to customers when a contract is established  the price is determined  shipment is made and collectability is reasonably assured 
distributor agreements may be canceled by either party upon specified notice 
genesis grants distributors a right of return upon termination  either pursuant to the express terms of the agreement  or where no such express terms exist  genesis may grant a right of return for other business reasons 
accordingly  revenue and related cost of revenues from sales to distributors are deferred until the distributors resell the product  which is verified by point of sale reports 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price  relieve inventory of the value of the product shipped and record the gross margin as a component of accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
in certain circumstances  where orders are placed with non cancelable non returnable terms  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of recognizing revenue 
to date we have not experienced significant product returns 
manufacturing and supply we generally need to place purchase orders for products from our suppliers before we receive purchase orders from our customers 
this is because production lead times for silicon wafers  from which our products are 
table of contents manufactured  can be as long as three months  while many of our customers place orders only one month or less in advance of their requested delivery date 
we have agreements with suppliers in asia such that we are dependent on the suppliers manufacturing yields 
we continue to look at alternative sources of supply to reduce our reliance on key suppliers and reduce lead times  though dual sourcing for specific products is more costly in terms of set up and yields are typically lower as each manufacturing supplier ramps up production 
while we have frequent communication with significant customers to review their requirements  we are restricted in our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products and this exposes us to the risk of having either too much or not enough of a particular product 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of inventory held 
for the year ended march   we recorded net reserves totaling  where we do not foresee sufficient demand for the on hand inventory to support the carrying value 
an example of this would be where certain customers transitioned to next generation products more quickly than previously anticipated 
global operations we operate through subsidiaries and offices in several countries throughout the world 
our corporate office is located in alviso silicon valley  california 
our research and development resources are located in the united states  canada and india 
the majority of our customers are located in asia  supported by our sales offices in china  japan  south korea  and taiwan 
our third party suppliers are located primarily in taiwan 
although virtually all of our revenues and costs of revenues are denominated in us dollars  portions of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or other transactions intended to manage the risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  other than natural hedges that occur as a result of holding both assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
our operating expenses are also affected by changes in the rate of inflation in the various countries in which we operate 
mergers and acquisitions technology companies often use mergers or acquisitions to accelerate development of products  to realize potential synergies or to enter new markets 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past  for example sage inc in february  resulting in the recording of significant intangible assets on our balance sheet 
for further details on earlier acquisitions  please refer to previously filed annual and quarterly reports 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
as described below  significant estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence provision  deferred tax asset valuation  potential settlements and costs associated with patent litigation and the useful lives of intangible assets 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns based on historical experience 
a customer has a right to return products only if the product is faulty  although in certain circumstances we agree to accept returns if replacement orders are placed for other products or to maintain our business relationship 
if actual customer returns increase  we may be required to recognize additional reductions to revenue 
we record the estimated future cost of replacing faulty product as an increase to cost of revenues 
to date we have not experienced significant returns related to quality 
if returns increase as a result of changes in product quality  we may be required to recognize additional warranty expense 
we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have not suffered any significant loss in this area 
we provide for valuation reserves against our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory valuation reserves may be required 
we provide for costs associated with settling litigation when we believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating those costs 
if actual costs associated with settling litigation differ from our estimates  we may be required to recognize additional costs 
goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations  is tested annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired 
the impairment tests are performed in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level 
we have assigned all goodwill to a single  enterprise level reporting unit 
the impairment test consists of two steps 
first  we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value is then compared to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill would be determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment test on january st of each year 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal   or goodwill balances may also be affected by changes in other estimates  for example  related to the ability to utilize acquired tax benefits  made at the time of acquisitions 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our gross deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in making this determination  we project taxable income by jurisdiction for the next three years based on market assumptions and company plans  and other jurisdictional history 
from time to time  we incur costs related to potential merger activities 
when we assess that we will be the acquirer for accounting purposes in such transactions and we expect to complete the transaction  direct costs associated with the acquisition are deferred and form part of the final purchase price 
in the event these assessments change  any such deferred costs would be expensed 
costs associated with other merger activities are expensed as incurred 

table of contents results of operations revenue and gross profit year ended march  in thousands total revenue gross profit gross profit percentage revenue by geography united states china japan south korea taiwan rest of world total revenue revenue total revenue for the year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the year ended march   which in turn represented an increase of from million for the year ended march  while unit shipments increased by to million units from million units in fiscal  as the markets in which we operate continue to grow  the increase in dollar terms was offset by lower blended average selling prices asps  which decreased by 
lcd monitor controller asps have experienced the largest decline  and estimated revenue from this market declined to million for the year ended march  from million in fiscal  as higher unit shipments were not sufficient to offset asps declines of 
our estimate of unit shipments into flat panel televisions grew by during the year  driving estimated revenue from this market to million  an increase of compared to fiscal total revenues from shipments into displays with video capability  such as lcd television  continue to increase and have become a larger proportion of total revenue 
during fiscal  we estimate that approximately of total revenue was from consumer video related products  compared with for fiscal  and we expect this percentage to grow to more than during fiscal unit shipments of all controllers increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  while asps declined by during the same period 
we continue to ship the majority of our product to customers located in asia  and we expect most of the growth to come from this area in the future 
within asia  shipments into china have increased significantly over the last two years  despite slightly declining revenue in fiscal primarily due to lower asps from units shipped into the monitor market 
in addition to revenue from shipments of display controllers  we generated revenue from licensing our patented technology to third parties in connection with the favorable final determination in the itc case 
we signed licensing agreements with a number of customers during the year ended march   providing them with the flexibility to maintain multiple sources for supply  while ensuring that we are compensated for the rights to use our intellectual property 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended march  of million was flat compared with fiscal  and represented an increase of approximately over fiscal while we experienced slightly lower revenues 
table of contents than fiscal  the mix of product sold and continued efforts to reduce the overall manufacturing cost of our products  had a favorable impact on gross profit percentage 
gross profit percentage for fiscal was compared with in fiscal and in fiscal maintaining a healthy gross profit margin in a high volume industry where asps decline steadily over time is both one of our main challenges and our strengths 
our leadership position in the monitor market provides us with an advantage over our competitors with respect to purchasing power  enhancing our ability to remain extremely competitive in all sectors of the market place 
operating expenses management focuses on particular operating expenses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
the following table presents these expenses in the form reviewed by management 
significant trends and fluctuations between periods are addressed in the narrative which follows 
in order to evaluate operating performance  management internally reports operating expenses in categories of a cash  non cash  and non recurring nature 
non cash expenses such as the amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation are reviewed separately from other operating expenses 
management finds this presentation to be a more effective method of assessing current operating performance 
year ended march  of revenue of revenue of revenue in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquired intangibles stock based compensation provision for costs associated with patent litigation vm labs operating and other restructuring costs total operating expenses research and development research and development expenses include costs associated with research and development personnel  development tools  hardware and software licenses  and prototyping 
research and development expenses for the year ended march  were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal this represents annual sequential increases of at least per year  and is a reflection of the continued investment in the research and development of technologies addressing the television and video markets 
in addition  the mix of spending has changed  as we devote increasing resources to improving performance and integration of the more complex multimedia and video applications  especially digital tv technologies  while the focus within lower end monitor applications has switched more to cost reduction than innovation or integration 
genesis s move towards lower geometry processes  including um and lower  for its highly integrated dtv chips has also increased research and development spending 
these expenses represented of revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs for selling  including field application engineers  product marketing  marketing communications  customer support  finance  human resources  legal  public company costs related  but not limited to  our compliance with the sarbanes oxley 
table of contents act of  general management functions and commissions paid to sales representatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the majority of the million increase from fiscal to related to three main factors 
first  and most significantly  we invested an additional million for increased labor resources  particularly field application engineers  to support the expected growth in the advanced display market 
we provide technical sales support through field application engineers in china  japan  india  south korea  and taiwan 
these engineers assist our customers to integrate our products into their display designs 
we believe that this kind of investment at the early stages of a growing market positions us well to capitalize on the future unit growth that is forecasted for the television market  second  million of costs were incurred associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of we expect the cost of ongoing compliance to be lower in the future 
and third  we incurred approximately million of severance and other costs associated with the departure of certain employees  including former executive officers 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was also primarily related to additional headcount to support the expected growth in our target markets 
these expenses represented of revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions of sage and the vm labs business was million for each of the three fiscal years   and we anticipate the amortization of existing acquired intangibles to decline to million in fiscal  million in fiscal   and  and zero thereafter  assuming no future acquisition activity 
stock based compensation as part of the accounting for the acquisition of sage in february  the intrinsic value of unvested options issued in exchange for previously issued sage options  totaling approximately million  is being amortized to expense over the remaining term of the options  categorized in the statement of operations in accordance with the nature of the service provided by the related employees 
this amortization amounted to million for the year ended march  in addition to this ongoing charge  additional stock based compensation of million was recorded during fiscal  primarily resulting from the modification of option grants to certain executives as part of their separation agreements 
the remaining million of unamortized deferred stock based compensation will be amortized during the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is currently expected to be effective for the company for fiscal  will result in additional stock based compensation beginning in our first fiscal quarter ending june  for further details of this new accounting pronouncement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in assessing operating performance  management excludes these expenses from other research and development and selling  general and administrative costs 
costs associated with patent litigation we have incurred significant costs associated with patent litigation over the past three fiscal years 
however  we incurred substantially less litigation costs during fiscal during fiscal  we incurred legal 
table of contents costs associated with patent litigation of million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the majority of the expense was in connection with certain patent litigation brought by us against several companies resulting in a favorable ruling in august if we decide to take legal action against other companies in the future  or if intellectual property infringement suits are brought against us or our customers  these costs may increase 
more details of the various litigation matters are described in this report under item  legal proceedings 
total operating expenses total operating expenses for the year ended march  were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal while total expenses have remained relatively constant  the mix of expenditures has changed for the reasons described above 
non operating income and expenses gain on sale of investment during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold of our minority interest in a private company for approximately million  realizing a gain of million 
the remaining investment with a carrying value of million is included in other long term assets 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended march   compared with recoveries of million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  our accounting effective tax rate differs from the expected statutory rates due to several permanent differences including  but not limited to  research and experimental development tax credits  stock based compensation expense  foreign exchange fluctuations on the us dollar working capital balances of foreign subsidiaries  and differences in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
any net tax benefit of these items is partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance against net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
historically  the significant majority of the valuation allowance in the financial statements has been against the tax attributes in the united states 
therefore  the effective tax rate will continue to be directly impacted by the mix of earnings between the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
we elected to apply this provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately million of funds were repatriated by our canadian operating subsidiary which will be treated as a dividend for us tax purposes 
only of this dividend is taxable  but this may not be sheltered by net operating losses  resulting in a tax charge to the company of approximately million dollars 
this charge also increased our effective tax rate for the year 
we do not expect to repatriate any more earnings from international affiliates in the foreseeable future as we consider the investments to be permanent in nature 
therefore  potential us income or foreign withholding taxes payable on future unremitted earnings will not be provided 
as of march   we had generated deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have approximately million of operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income 
the carry forwards expire on various dates through  if not used 
utilization of a portion of net operating losses is subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 

table of contents we have established a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to certain net operating loss carry forwards 
at march   the valuation allowance totaled million and we have million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
we may record additional valuation allowances in the future 
the benefit of million of operating losses carry forwards  which relate to acquired entities or deductions associated with the exercise of certain stock options  if utilized  will result in an increase to equity or a reduction of goodwill 
future income tax provisions will depend on our effective tax rates  the distribution of taxable income between taxation jurisdictions  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  the amount of research and development performed in canada  and the likelihood of being able to utilize available tax credits or losses 
quarterly results of operations the following table shows our unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the most recent eight quarters reported 
this unaudited data has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements that are included in item of this report  and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information for the periods presented

table of contents most of our revenues come from sales of semiconductors to manufacturers of flat panel displays  including lcd monitors and flat panel tvs 
revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including  but not limited to the relative growth in the our target markets  changes in our market share  the rate of decline in asps  the price of lcd panels  which often impacts demand for our products  and inventory levels of display controllers at our customers locations 
gross margins have fluctuated depending on changes in product mix  levels of inventory reserves required  and the difference in rates of decline of asp s compared to average product costs 
research and development expenses have varied from quarter to quarter primarily due to fluctuations in staff levels and the timing of non recurring engineering charges related to new product development 
selling  general and administrative expenses have varied from quarter to quarter primarily due to increases in staffing levels for sales and customer support activities  costs associated with compliance of the sarbanes oxley act of  sales and marketing promotional events  and sales commissions 
costs associated with patent litigation fluctuate depending on the level of activity related to specific legal proceedings and the timing of provision for potential settlements 
more details of the legal proceedings are described in item of this report 
income tax expense recovery depends primarily on the levels of taxable income  the distribution of taxable income between jurisdictions  foreign exchange fluctuations  and the likelihood of being able to utilize available tax credits or losses 
in addition  the provision for income taxes for the quarter ended march  was impacted by the repatriation of funds by our canadian operating subsidiary  which resulted in a charge of million  as discussed earlier 
our results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include those described under the caption risk factors  among others 
any one or more of these factors could result in our failure to achieve our expectations as to future operating results 
our expenditures for research and development  selling  general and administrative functions are based in part on future revenue projections 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated declines in revenues  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to reduce our selling prices in response to competitive pressure or other factors  or to increase spending to pursue new market opportunities or to defend ourselves against lawsuits that may be brought against us 
any decline in asps of a particular product that is not offset by a reduction in product costs or by sales of other products with higher gross margins  would decrease our overall gross profit and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have satisfied our liquidity needs primarily through cash generated from operations and sales of equity securities  initially by way of a public offering  and subsequently under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we believe that our existing cash balances together with any cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
periodically  we may be required to use a portion of our cash balances to increase investment in operating assets such as accounts receivable or inventory to assist in the growth of our business  or for capital assets such as land  buildings or equipment 
furthermore  because we do not have our own semiconductor manufacturing facility  we may be required to make deposits to secure supply in the event there is a shortage of manufacturing capacity in the future 
while we currently have no plans to raise additional funds for such uses  we could be required or could elect to seek to raise additional capital in the future 

table of contents from time to time we evaluate acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that are complementary or strategic to our business 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our working capital or require the issuance of equity securities that may result in further dilution to our existing stockholders 
march  cash and short term investments working capital current ratio receivables days outstanding inventory days we believe that our financial condition remains strong 
at march   cash and short term investments totaled million up from million at march  and million at march  our current ratio decreased to at march  from at march  we have no debt and we expect to continue to generate cash from operations during fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march  compared with cash used in operating activities of million during fiscal and cash generated from operating activities of million for fiscal working capital uses of cash included the increase in accounts receivable of million from march  to march  days sales outstanding also increased from days at march  to days at march  this increase reflects the timing of shipments during the period  the mix shift of customers and  the anticipated impact of extending payment terms to certain key customers 
this trend is expected to continue as we compete with the terms offered by our competition and as our key customers face demands from their own customers to provide more favorable payment terms 
also  as our customers become more established in china  we are becoming more comfortable with extending credit 
our credit policy is to offer credit to customers only after examination of their creditworthiness 
our payment terms range from cash in advance of shipment  to payment sixty days after shipment 
for fiscal  our three largest customers accounted for approximately of revenue  compared with in fiscal and in fiscal additionally  the top three customers accounted for of accounts receivable at march  and at march  lower inventory and higher accounts payable balances reduced overall non cash working capital 
inventory levels decreased by during fiscal this decrease primarily reflects the decrease in the average cost of our inventory units on hand and the timing of receipt of inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal average days of inventory during the year ended march  were days compared to days for the year ended march  the average inventory levels and the impact on inventory turns is the result of a number of factors including the accuracy of customer s forecasts  expected panel and wafer supplies  lead times at our wafer and back end suppliers  and pricing considerations  and is not necessarily an indication of what inventory turns might be in the future 
accounts payable balances increased by million  primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers 
net cash from investing activities was million during the year ended march  this included the net sale of short term investments of million offset in part by capital and other spending of million 
this compared to million used in investing activities in the year ended march   and million provided by investing activities in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended march   and million in the year ended march  this represented funds received for the purchase of shares under the terms of our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  we used million in net cash for financing activities  including million to repurchase common stock  and million to settle an outstanding lease liability  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations as of march   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
these commitments include leases for two premises in the united states  located in san jose and alviso  california  two in china and one location in each of canada  india  japan  south korea and taiwan 
in addition  we have obligations under operating leases for equipment 
the aggregate minimum annual payments required under our lease obligations  excluding expected sub lease income  by fiscal year are as follows  in thousands of dollars payments due by fiscal year total operating lease obligations our lease agreements expire at various dates through calendar purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw material and other goods and services have not been separately disclosed 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders for manufacturing are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
further information on lease obligations and commitments can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
capital commitments we do not have any capital commitments that will have a material future effect on our financial condition 
risk factors our quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in our stock price 
our historical revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter 
moreover  our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  which may cause our stock price to decline 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this risk factors section  a number of factors may cause our revenue to fall short of our expectations or cause fluctuations in our operating results  including our ability to make timely new product introductions and gain design wins with our customers  growth rate of the lcd monitor market  flat panel television market and our other markets  changes in the mix of products we sell  consumer demand for the displays into which our products are incorporated  
table of contents increased competition and competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in supply or demand for other components included in flat panel displays  customer inventory levels and manufacturing schedules  supply of products from our third party suppliers  changes in product costs or manufacturing yields or available production capacity at our fabrication facilities  the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for the display products that incorporate our products  especially the flat panel television market  and costs and outcome of legal proceedings 
as a result of the fluctuation in our revenues and operating results  our stock price can be volatile  especially if our actual financial performance in a quarter deviates from the financial targets we set at the beginning of that quarter  or from market expectations 
we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and are characterized by technological change  evolving industry standards and rapidly declining average selling prices 
we compete with both large and small companies  including ati technologies  broadcom corp  intel corp  lsi logic corp  micronas semiconductor holding ag  media reality technologies  inc  mediatek corp  mstar semiconductor  inc  novatek microelectronics  philips semiconductors  a division of philips electronics nv  pixelworks  inc  realtek semiconductor corp  silicon image  inc  st microelectronics  inc  trident microsystems  inc  and zoran corporation 
in addition  many of our current and potential customers have their own internally developed integrated circuit solutions  and may choose not to purchase solutions from third party suppliers like genesis 
as the markets for our products continue to develop  our current customers may increase reliance on their own internally developed solutions  and competition from diversified electronic and semiconductor companies will intensify 
some competitors  who may include our own customers  are likely to include companies with greater financial and other resources than us 
our overseas competitors have reduced cost structures that enable them to compete aggressively on price 
increased competition could harm our business  by  for example  increasing pressure on our profit margins or causing us to lose customers 
also  the federal district court for the eastern district of virginia has issued an amended final judgment which states that we have received a license from silicon image  inc for certain of their dvi and hdmi patents  and must pay silicon image royalties on all of our dvi and hdmi products 
this amended final judgment  if not overturned on appeal  could hinder our ability to compete with unlicensed competitors that are not required to pay royalties on competing products 
we must develop new products and enhance our existing products to react to rapid technological change 
we must develop new products and enhance our existing products with improved technologies to meet rapidly evolving customer requirements and industry standards 
we need to design products for customers that continually require higher functionality at lower costs 
this requires us to continue to add features to our products and to include all of these features on a single chip 
the development process for these advancements is lengthy and will require us to accurately anticipate technological innovations and market trends 
developing and enhancing these products is time consuming  costly and complex 
there is a risk that these developments and enhancements will be late  fail to meet customer or market specifications  and will not be competitive with other products using alternative technologies that offer comparable functionality 
we may be unable to successfully develop new products or product enhancements 
any new products or product enhancements may not be accepted in new or existing markets 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements  that failure will harm our business 

table of contents the loss of any of our major customers could have a significant impact on our business 
the markets for our products are highly concentrated 
our sales are derived from a limited number of customers 
sales to our largest five customers accounted for of our revenues  and for our largest customer  for the year ended march  we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a large amount of our revenues 
the decision by any large customer to decrease or cease using our products could harm our business 
in addition  our customers sell to a limited number of original equipment manufacturers oems 
the decision by any large oem to decrease or cease using our customer s products could  in turn  cause our customer to decrease or cease buying from us 
most of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements so that any customer could cease purchasing products at any time without penalty 
our success will depend on the growth of the market for flat panel televisions and lcd monitors 
our ability to generate revenues will depend on the growth of the market for flat panel televisions  lcd computer monitors  and digital televisions 
our continued growth will also depend upon emerging markets for consumer electronics markets such as hdtv and home theater 
the potential size of these markets and the timing of their development are uncertain and will depend in particular upon a significant reduction in the costs of products in the respective markets  the availability  at a reasonable price  of components required by such products such as lcd panels  and the emergence of competing technologies and standards 
these and other potential markets may not develop as expected  which would harm our business 
we must sell our current products in greater volumes  or introduce new products with improved gross margins 
average selling prices for our lcd monitor products have declined 
when average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we are able to sell more units  and our gross margin dollars decline unless we are able to reduce our manufacturing and or other supply chain costs by a commensurate amount 
we therefore need to sell our current products in greater volumes to offset the decline in their asps  while also introduce new products that have improved gross margins 
the sales of our products are highly concentrated and our products may not continue to be accepted in the advanced display industry 
our sales are derived from a limited number of products 
five of our products accounted for of our revenues for the year ended march  there were no other products accounting for more than ten percent of our revenues 
we expect that a small number of products will continue to account for a large amount of our revenues 
our success in the advanced display market  which includes lcd computer monitors  as well as lcd and digital televisions  home theater  dvd  and hdtv will depend upon the extent to which manufacturers of those products incorporate our integrated circuits into their products 
our ability to sell products into this market will depend upon demand for the functionality provided by our products and their pricing 
we typically need to determine the functionality of our products and to complete their design in advance of our customers completing the designs of their products 
as a result  we may not be able to react to changes in our customers desired functionality in a timely manner 

table of contents our future operating results are highly dependent upon how well we manage our business 
our future operating results will depend in large part on how well we manage our business  including our ability to develop profitable products and meet milestones by accurately forecasting revenues and costs and allocating resources effectively  develop strategies to protect our brands and to realize their potential value  manage our inventory levels by accurately predicting sales volumes  maximize our gross margins by negotiating favorable yet competitive prices with customers  and by leveraging volume to reduce costs with our suppliers  develop effective selling tools  and monitor and manage expenses 
any failure by us to effectively manage our business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
intellectual property infringement suits brought against us or our customers may significantly harm our business 
we have been defending claims brought against us by silicon image  inc  alleging that certain of our products that contain digital receivers infringe various silicon image patent claims 
on december   the court issued its amended final judgment in the proceeding  which such judgment is being appealed  see item  legal proceedings 
in addition  ip innovation llc has sued dell computer corporation  sony electronics  inc  and matsushita electric corporation of america  alleging patent infringement by certain of those companies respective consumer and or professional electronics products  including some that contain our display controller products 
these lawsuits or any future patent infringement lawsuits could subject us to permanent injunctions preventing us from selling the accused products and or cause us to incur significant costs  including defense costs  settlements and judgments 
in addition  as a result of these lawsuits or any future patent infringement lawsuits  our existing customers may decide to stop buying our products  and prospective customers may be unwilling to buy our products 
intellectual property lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful and our products or our customers monitors or televisions that contain our products are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we could be forced to do one or more of the following stop selling the products or using the technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  incur substantial costs including defense costs  settlements and or judgments  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
as a result  intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial results and market share 

table of contents we may be required to indemnify our customers against claims of intellectual property infringement 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with our customers that contain indemnification provisions for claims based on infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
as a result  if such a claim based on our products is made against an indemnified customer  we may be required under our indemnification obligations to defend or settle the litigation  and or to reimburse that customer for its costs  including defense costs  settlements and judgments 
we may also be subject to claims for indemnification under statutory or common law 
for example  some of our customers have requested assistance and indemnification in connection with lawsuits or threatened lawsuits by ip innovation llc against dell computer corporation and other consumer electronics companies alleging patent infringement by various products that may contain our display controller products 
this or other patent litigation and any indemnification obligations we may have could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial results and market share  and could result in significant payments by us that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as non disclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
we have had significant management turnover  and may not be able to retain or attract the key personnel we need to succeed 
we have had significant turnover in our management team 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain other key employees  including senior management and executive positions 
if we cannot attract and retain these key employees  our business would be harmed  particularly if the departure of any key employee results in a business interruption or if we are not successful in preserving material knowledge of our departing employees 
we may become subject to judgments for securities class action suits 
we are a defendant in a securities class action suit 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims in the securities class action suit as well as adequate insurance coverage to cover any likely unfavorable outcome 
however  this or any future securities class action suit could subject us to judgments in excess of our insurance coverage and could harm our business 
in addition  this kind of lawsuit  regardless of its outcome  is likely to be time consuming and expensive to resolve and may divert management time and resources 
the processes used to manufacture our semiconductor products are periodically retired 
as semiconductor manufacturing technologies advance  manufacturers typically retire their older manufacturing processes in favor of newer processes 
when this occurs  the manufacturer generally provides notice to its customers of its intent to discontinue a process  and its customers will either retire the affected part or design a newer version of the part that can be manufactured on the more advanced process 
consequently  our products may become unavailable from their current manufacturers if the processes on which they are produced are discontinued 
our devices are mainly   and micron technology and these geometries will likely be available for the next two to three years 
we must manage the transition to new parts from existing parts 
we have commitments from our suppliers to provide notice of any discontinuance of their manufacturing processes in order to assist us in managing these types of product transitions 

table of contents our semiconductor products are complex and are difficult to manufacture cost effectively 
the manufacture of semiconductors is a complex process 
it is often difficult for semiconductor foundries to achieve acceptable product yields 
product yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to the semiconductor foundry 
since low yields may result from either design or process difficulties  identifying yield problems can only occur well into the production cycle  when a product exists which can be physically analyzed and tested 
defects in our products could increase our costs  cause customer claims  and delay our product shipments 
although we test our products  they are complex and may contain defects and errors 
in the past we have encountered defects and errors in our products 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
any of these events could harm our business 
we subcontract our manufacturing  assembly and test operations 
we do not have our own fabrication facilities  assembly or testing operations 
instead  we rely on others to fabricate  assemble and test all of our products 
most of our products use silicon wafers manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  the loss of which could result in a material increase in the price we must pay for silicon wafers 
none of our products are fabricated by more than one supplier 
there are many risks associated with our dependence upon outside manufacturing  including reduced control over manufacturing and delivery schedules of products  potential political or environmental risks in the countries where the manufacturing facilities are located  reduced control over quality assurance and reliability  increased manufacturing cost to us in the event that manufacturing capacity becomes constrained  difficulty of management of manufacturing costs and quantities  potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  and potential misappropriation of intellectual property 
we depend upon outside manufacturers to fabricate silicon wafers on which our integrated circuits are imprinted 
these wafers must be of acceptable quality and in sufficient quantity and the manufacturers must deliver them to assembly and testing subcontractors on time for packaging into final products 
we have at times experienced delivery delays and long manufacturing lead times 
these manufacturers fabricate  test and assemble products for other companies 
we cannot be sure that our manufacturers will devote adequate resources to the production of our products or deliver sufficient quantities of finished products to us on time or at an acceptable cost 
the lead time necessary to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner is considerable 
we would be unable to readily obtain an alternative source of supply for any of our products if this proves necessary 
any occurrence of these manufacturing difficulties could harm our business or cause us to incur costs to obtain adequate and timely supply of products 
our third party wafer foundries  third party assembly and test subcontractors and significant customers are located in an area susceptible to natural disasters as well as political unrest 
most of our outside foundries  third party assembly and test subcontractors are located in taiwan  which is an area susceptible to natural disasters 
in addition  some of our significant customers are located in taiwan 
damage caused by natural disasters in taiwan may result in shortages of water or electricity or cause 
table of contents transportation difficulties that could limit the production capacity of our outside foundries or the ability of our subcontractors to provide assembly and test services 
any reduction in production capacity or the ability to provide assembly and test services could cause delays or shortages in our product supply  which would harm our business 
foundries located in taiwan were responsible for most of our semiconductor product revenue for the year ended march  sales to customers located in taiwan were of our revenue for the year ended march  if future natural disasters damage our customers facilities or equipment they could reduce their purchases of our products  which would harm our business 
in addition  the operations of suppliers to our outside foundries and our taiwanese customers could be disrupted by future natural disasters  which could in turn harm our business by resulting in shortages in our product supply or reduced purchases of our products 
political tensions between taiwan and china expose our business to additional risk 
we do not have long term commitments from our customers  and we allocate resources based on our estimates of customer demand 
our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders 
we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand 
this process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may manufacture products that we may not be able to sell 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would increase our losses 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable  we would forego revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays in generating revenues 
because our products are based on new technology and standards  a lengthy sales process  typically requiring several months or more  is often required before potential customers begin the technical evaluation of our products 
this technical evaluation can then exceed six months 
it can take an additional six months before a customer commences volume shipments of systems that incorporate our products 
however  even when a manufacturer decides to design our products into its systems  the manufacturer may never ship systems incorporating our products 
given our lengthy sales cycle  we experience a delay between the time we increase expenditures for research and development  sales and marketing efforts and inventory and the time we generate revenues  if any  from these expenditures 
as a result  our business could be harmed if a significant customer reduces or delays its orders or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
our business depends on relationships with industry leaders that are non binding 
we work closely with industry leaders in the markets we serve to design products with improved performance  cost and functionality 
we typically commit significant research and development resources to such design activities 
we often divert financial and personnel resources from other development projects without entering into agreements obligating these industry leaders to continue the collaborative design project or to purchase the resulting products 
the failure of an industry leader to complete development of a collaborative design project or to purchase the products resulting from such projects would have an immediate and serious impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to establish such relationships in the future would  similarly  harm our business 
a large percentage of our revenues will come from sales outside of the united states  which creates additional business risks 
a large portion of our revenues will come from sales to customers outside of the united states  particularly to equipment manufacturers located in south korea  china  japan and taiwan 
for the year ended march   sales to regions outside of the united states represented of revenues 
for that same period  sales to china and south korea alone constituted and  respectively  of revenues 
these sales are subject to numerous risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  
table of contents unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  political and economic instability  exposure to litigation or government investigations in these countries  longer payment periods  ability to enforce contracts or payment terms  potentially adverse tax consequences  export license requirements  and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
because our sales are denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products in non us markets and may make our products more expensive than competitors products denominated in local currencies 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations  which may harm our business 
we depend on product design groups located outside of the united states  primarily in canada and in india 
we also rely on foreign third party manufacturing  assembly and testing operations 
these foreign operations subject us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including the following unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  imposition of additional taxes and penalties  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors beyond our control  including acts of terrorism  which may delay the shipment of our products  impair our ability to travel or our ability to communicate with foreign locations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be designed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this increases the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may lead to significant variances in the demand for our products 
in the past  significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand have characterized the semiconductor industry 
also  the industry has experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions  including economic conditions in asia 
these cycles have led to significant variances in product demand and production capacity 
they have also accelerated the erosion of average selling prices per unit 
we may experience periodic fluctuations in our future financial results because of changes in industry wide conditions 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which causes their sales to fluctuate 
our products are incorporated into flat panel displays 
because the market for flat panel displays is characterized by numerous new product introductions  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our customers also experience seasonality in the sales of their products  which affects their orders of 
table of contents our products 
typically  the second half of the calendar year represents a disproportionate percentage of sales for our customers due to the holiday shopping period for these products  and therefore  a disproportionate percentage of our sales 
also  our sales in the first quarter of the calendar year may be lower as a result of the chinese new year holiday in asia 
we expect these sales fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future 
a breakdown in our information technology systems could cause a business interruption  impair our ability to manage our business or report results  or result in the unauthorized disclosure of our confidential and proprietary information 
our information technology systems could suffer a sudden breakdown as a result of factors beyond our control  such as earthquakes  network attacks or intrusions  or problems with our outside vendors who provide information technology services and network connectivity to us 
if our information technology systems were to fail and we were not able to gain timely access to adequate alternative systems or back up information  this could have a negative impact on our ability to operate and manage our business and to report results in a timely manner 
also  any breach of our information systems by an unauthorized third party could result in our confidential information being made public or being used by a competitor  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the potential of our proprietary rights 
we may make acquisitions where advisable  and acquisitions involve numerous risks 
our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we may address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of other companies or technologies  such as our acquisitions of sage and the assets of vm labs 
these acquisitions and potential future acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following we may experience difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees  we may be unable to retain the key employees of the acquired operations  the acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business  we may not be able to incorporate successfully the acquired technologies and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  and we may lack the experience to enter into new markets  products or technologies 
acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our recent or potential future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we must also maintain our ability to manage growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions made by us could materially harm our business and operating results 
we need to continually evaluate internal financial controls against evolving standards 
the sarbanes oxley act of and newly proposed or enacted rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the national association of securities dealers impose new duties on us and our executives  directors  attorneys and independent registered public accountants 
in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and such new rules and regulations  we have evaluated our internal controls systems to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal controls 
as a result  we have incurred additional expenses for internal and outside legal  accounting and advisory services  which have increased our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income or increase our net losses 
while we have fully implemented the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section in a timely fashion  we cannot be certain as to the future outcome of our testing and resulting remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations 
we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements and we expect to continue to incur significant 
table of contents expenses in connection with this process 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 
in addition  current regulatory standards are subject to change  and additional standards may be imposed 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the recent economic slowdown  many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
as a result  if economic conditions in the united states  asia or europe worsen  or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  reduced orders and shipments may cause us to fall short of our revenue expectations for any given period and may result in us carrying increased inventory 
these conditions would negatively affect our business and results of operations 
if our inventory builds up as a result of order postponement  we would carry excess inventory that is either unusable or that must be sold at reduced prices which will harm our revenues 
in addition  weakness in the technology market could negatively affect the cash flow of our customers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure  which could harm our financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
we carry out a significant portion of our operations outside of the united states  primarily in canada and in india and to a lesser extent china  japan  south korea and taiwan 
although virtually all of our revenues and costs of revenues are denominated in us dollars  portions of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or other transactions intended to manage the risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  other than natural hedges that occur as a result of holding both assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we may  in the future  undertake hedging or other such transactions  if we determine that it is necessary to offset exchange rate risks 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at march   march   and march   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar relative to a pool of our foreign currencies would not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition
