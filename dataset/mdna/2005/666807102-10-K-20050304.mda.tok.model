outlook united states defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years 
while the current defense budget forecast shows a slower rate of growth than in prior years  and certain 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation programs in which the company participates may be subject to potential reductions  the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced  innovative products  services  and solutions in systems integration  defense electronics  information technology  advanced aircraft  shipbuilding  and space technology will generate revenue growth in and beyond 
in  based on total backlog funded and unfunded of approximately billion as of december   and its opportunity to win future programs  the company expects sales to range between billion and billion and continued improvements in net income and net cash provided by operating activities over the major industry and economic factors that will affect the company s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 
industry factors while northrop grumman is subject to the usual vagaries of the marketplace  it is also affected by the unique characteristics of the defense industry and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix 
northrop grumman  along with lockheed martin corporation lockheed martin  the boeing company boeing  raytheon company raytheon  and general dynamics corporation general dynamics are among the largest companies in the defense industry at this time 
northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs  both large and small 
intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman s business and the defense industry 
it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies 
a company competing to be a prime contractor may  upon ultimate award of the contract  turn out to be a subcontractor 
it is not uncommon to compete with a peer company and  simultaneously on other contracts  to be either a supplier to or a customer of such competitor 
the nature of major defense programs  conducted under binding contracts  allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity unknown in many industries 
the company s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products  as well as its ability to provide the people  facilities  equipment  and financial capacity needed to deliver those products with maximum efficiency 
it is necessary to maintain  as the company has  sources for raw materials  fabricated parts  electronic components  and major subassemblies 
in this manufacturing and systems integration environment  effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 
northrop grumman s operating policies are designed to achieve these objectives 
economic opportunities  challenges  and risks the defense of the united states and other north atlantic treaty organization nato countries requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts  terrorist acts  or threats to homeland security  and is increasingly more dependent upon proactive threat identification 
such engagements may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from passive surveillance to active engagement  deterrence  policing  or peacekeeping 
in addition  the dod s strategy continues to be affected by the general public s concern for placing military or civilian personnel at risk 
as a result of these trends  both the united states and other nato countries are increasingly relying on sophisticated weapon systems that provide long range surveillance and intelligence  battle management  and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy complete defensive platforms around the world 
accordingly  defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted towards the development and procurement of advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual weapons systems and provide for the real time integration of individual surveillance  information management  strike  and battle management platforms 
united states defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years 
defense spending in nato countries has stabilized  while those countries continue to increase their focus upon the development and procurement of advanced electronics and information systems capabilities 
although the ultimate size of future defense budgets remains uncertain  the budget submitted by the president of the united states indicates that the defense budget will increase approximately billion  or percent  over the next five years 
while this budget includes proposed reductions for certain programs in which the company 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation participates for example  cvn  dd x  kinetic energy interceptors  and virginia class submarines  the company believes that spending on recapitalization and transformation of homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority  with particular emphasis on areas involving intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance  and national missile defense 
substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include space based radar  transformational communication system  and several international and homeland security programs 
the company continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in and beyond 
us government programs in which northrop grumman either participates  or strives to participate  must compete with other programs for consideration during our nation s budget formulation and appropriation processes 
budget decisions made in this environment will have long term consequences for the size and structure of northrop grumman and the entire defense industry 
northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth  airborne surveillance  battle management  precision weapons  systems integration  defense electronics  and information technology 
through its acquisitions of litton industries  inc litton  newport news shipbuilding inc newport news  and trw  inc 
trw  the company now has a significant presence in federal and civil information systems  the manufacture of a broad range of ships including aircraft carriers and submarines  space technology  command  control intelligence ci  and missile systems 
the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense  but there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced  extended  or terminated 
the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non conforming items for a specified period of time 
most of the company s product warranties are provided under government contracts  the costs of which are generally recoverable from the customer 
prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations  including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act  with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines  penalties  debarment  or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies 
given the company s dependence on us government business  suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company

table of contents northrop grumman corporation an indemnification of other postretirement employee benefits pursuant to the auto sale agreement  and agreed to pay the blackstone group million 
as a result of the agreement  the company recorded a million after tax charge to continuing operations relating to the sale of the note  and a million after tax charge to discontinued operations related to the settlement of the indemnification and other contractual issues 
in november  the company received million for the sale of the note  which was net of million for settlement of the contractual issues  and paid million for settlement of the indemnification 
goodrich the company assumed through its acquisition of trw certain post closing liabilities retained by trw in connection with trw s october sale of its aeronautical systems business to goodrich corporation goodrich 
the company and goodrich agreed to a settlement to resolve certain post closing liabilities related to warranty  customer claims  and certain other matters in exchange for a payment to goodrich of million 
this settlement resulted in a fourth quarter after tax charge to discontinued operations of million 
the settlement excludes amounts associated with claims that goodrich may assert against the company relating to the airbus a actuation systems development program and certain other liabilities retained by trw under the original acquisition agreement 
discontinued operations during the third quarter of  the company concluded that the ct businesses  which were acquired as part of the litton acquisition  did not fit with the company s long term plans and decided to sell these businesses 
accordingly  the businesses comprising the ct segment were classified as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter of the company sold three of the ct businesses in and a fourth ct business in none of these sales  either individually or in the aggregate  had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the three remaining ct businesses consist of a manufacturer of complex printed circuit boards  an electronic connector manufacturer  and a european based marketing group 
during the third quarter of  the company suspended its efforts to sell these businesses 
accordingly  the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of these businesses have been reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations for all periods presented 
these businesses are reported under the segment entitled other 
northrop grumman canada on december   the company completed the sale of its canadian navigation systems and space sensors systems businesses for million in cash  and recorded a million after tax gain in discontinued operations 
the assets and liabilities as well as the results of operations of the canadian navigation systems and space sensors systems businesses were not material to any of the periods presented and have therefore not been reclassified as discontinued operations 
contracts the majority of the company s business is generated from long term government contracts for development  production  and service activities 
government contracts typically include the following negotiated cost direct material  labor and subcontracting costs  and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs 
unless otherwise specified in a contract  costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the federal acquisition regulations far and government cas as allowable and allocable costs 
examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the us government based on the far and cas unallowable clauses include  but are not limited to certain legal costs  mark to market stock compensation expense  lobbying costs  charitable donations  and advertising costs 
the company s long term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories cost reimbursement or cost type contracts cost type contracts provide for reimbursement of allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit 
cost type contracts generally require that the contractor use best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 
fixed price contracts a fixed price contract is a contract in which the price is a pre determined negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment because of costs incurred by the contractor 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation the following table summarizes revenue recognized by contract type and customer contract type in millions us government other customers total percent of total cost type fixed price total contract fees negotiated contract fee structures  for both cost type and fixed price contracts may include  but are not limited to fixed fee amounts  cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance  positive award fee  and negative penalty arrangements 
profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements  percentage of completion of the contract  the achievement of performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
contract risk due to their nature  fixed price contracts inherently have more risk than cost type contracts and therefore generally carry higher profit margins 
cost type contracts may carry risk to the extent of their specific contract terms and conditions relating to performance award fees and negative performance incentives 
the more significant risk factors relating to the company s contracts are fixed price development contracts and negative performance incentive provisions included in certain cost type and fixed price contracts 
fixed price development contracts fixed price development work inherently has more uncertainty as to future events than production and therefore more variability in estimates of costs to complete the development stage 
as work progresses through the development stage into production  the risks associated with estimating the costs of development are reduced 
in addition  successful performance of fixed price development contracts  which include production units  is subject to the company s ability to control cost growth in meeting production specifications and delivery rates 
while management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixed price development programs  future events could result in either upward or downward adjustments to those estimates 
examples of the company s significant fixed price development contracts include the f block combat avionics program and the mesa radar system for the australian defence force s project wedgetail program  both of which are performed by the electronic systems segment 
it is also not unusual in the ships segment for the company to negotiate fixed price production follow on contracts before the development effort has been completed and learning curves fully realized on existing contracts 
examples of negotiated fixed price follow on production options or contracts are the polar tanker program and the virginia class submarine program 
positive award fees certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fee amounts based on performance criteria such as cost  schedule  quality  and technical ingenuity 
award fees are determined and earned based on the subjective evaluation by the customer of the company s performance against such negotiated criteria 
award fee contracts are widely used throughout the company s operating segments  examples of significant long term contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the kei  npoess  f  lpd  and dd x programs 
negative performance incentive provisions certain contracts  primarily involving space satellite systems  contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of partial or complete failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for a specified period of time 
under such terms  the company could be required to forfeit fees previously recognized and or collected 
the company has not experienced any significant losses in the last decade in connection with contract performance incentive provisions 
however  if the company were to experience launch failures or complete satellite system failures in the future  such events could have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation compliance and monitoring on a regular basis  the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations 
in addition  costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 
critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments the company s significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements see part ii  item of this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management is responsible for evaluating the propriety of its estimates  judgments  and accounting methods as new events occur 
management believes that its policies  estimates  and judgments have been consistently applied in a manner that provides the reader of the company s financial statements with a fair presentation of information  in all material respects  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management periodically reviews the company s critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments with the audit committee of its board of directors 
principal accounting practices that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity are outlined below 
revenue recognition overview the company generally recognizes revenue from its long term contracts under the cost to cost and the units of delivery measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
for most contracts  sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for certain contracts with large up front purchases of material  primarily in the ships segment  sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs 
the units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method  which recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of a basic production product delivered during a period  and as the cost of product sales the costs allocable to the delivered units  costs allocated to undelivered units are reported in the balance sheet as inventoried costs 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of its products and services 
such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
sales under cost type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
revenue relating to service contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
application of accounting principles the majority of the company s contracts are accounted for under the provisions of accounting research bulletin no 
accounting for long term construction type contracts  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contract  the aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  and aicpa sop no 
software revenue recognition  as amended by sop these pronouncements apply to contracts for the construction of facilities  production of goods and services provided to the federal government  and arrangements to deliver software or software systems requiring significant production  modification  or customization 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation cost estimation the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  program managers  and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance  availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances 
cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
performance incentives and award fees many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product 
these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred 
incentives and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentives and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 
loss provisions when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in the period the loss is determined 
loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets  with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 
other changes in estimates other changes in estimates of contract sales  costs  and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
hence  the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates had been the original estimates 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
additional details concerning the company s revenue recognition policy are in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item purchase accounting and goodwill overview the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time that may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties or restructuring activities  which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period 
acquisition accruals the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures 
these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures 
the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and  in most cases  involve a significant degree of judgment 
management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements  known facts  and an estimation of probable future events based on management s experience and consultation with outside experts 
goodwill the company evaluates the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually  or when evidence of potential impairment exists  in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles assets 
in order to test for potential impairment  the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the weighted average cost of capital wacc and the terminal value growth rate assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value growth rates are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
the terminal value growth rate used for testing purposes in approximates the estimated long term inflation rate 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit s fair value  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis 
differences in assumptions within a range considered by management to be reasonable  applied to the annual goodwill impairment tests  would not have resulted in a significant adjustment to recorded goodwill 
litigation and contingencies overview in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
the company is subject to a range of claims  lawsuits  environmental and income tax matters  and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item environmental accruals the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts or conducted operations 
the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
factors which could result in changes to the company s environmental accruals and reasonably possible range of loss include modification of planned remedial actions  increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate  discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated  changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements  and improvements in remediation technology 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation tax contingency accruals the company records accruals for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority 
changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from pre acquisition years for acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill 
other adjustments to tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 
retirement benefits overview assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries 
in the event that the company determines that changes in the assumptions are warranted  future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
assumptions the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on the company s financial position and results of operations are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rates 
discount rate the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate fixed income investments 
at the end of each year  the discount rate is primarily determined based on the results of a hypothetical long term bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments 
taking into consideration the factors noted above  the company lowered the discount rate to percent at december   from percent at december  expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated benefit payments 
for  the company assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent 
on average  the actual return on plan assets over the long term has exceeded percent  however  for  the expected long term rate of return assumption was lowered from percent to percent  reflecting the generally expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets 
differences in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on pension and postretirement benefit results in millions 
percentage point increase 
percentage point decrease increase decrease to pension expense resulting from change in discount rate change in long term rate of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and changes in the health status of the plan participants 
the company increased its expected health care cost trend rate to percent for from percent for 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation differences in the health care cost trend rates within the indicated range would have had the following impact on postretirement benefit results in millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease increase decrease from change in health care cost trend rates to postretirement benefit expense postretirement benefit liability management financial measures the company manages and assesses the performance of its business primarily through the following measures contract acquisitions contract acquisitions represent orders received during the period for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer 
contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from year to year and are determined by the size and timing of new and follow on orders 
in the year that a business is purchased  its existing funded order backlog as of the purchase date is reported as contract acquisitions 
sales year to year sales vary less than contract acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts 
for further information related to revenue recognition  refer to the revenue recognition discussion included in the critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments section of this part ii  item segment operating margin segment operating margin reflects the performance of segment contracts and programs 
excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance  including the portion of pension expense income that is not currently recognized under cas  as well as the portion of corporate  legal  environmental  state income tax  other retiree benefits  and other expenses not considered allowable costs under cas and therefore not allocated to the segments 
backlog funded backlog represents unfilled orders for which funding has been contractually obligated by the customer 
unfunded backlog represents firm orders for which funding is not contractually obligated by the customer 
unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq orders 
segment operating results realignment effective january   the company realigned businesses among three of its operating segments that possess similar customers  expertise  and capabilities 
the realignment more fully leverages existing capabilities and enhances development and delivery of highly integrated information systems and services 
mission systems global information technology  civil systems  and mission systems europe businesses were transferred to the information technology segment
