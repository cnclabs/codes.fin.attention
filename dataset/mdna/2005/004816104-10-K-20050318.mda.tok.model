critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting estimates are particularly important to the understanding of the company s financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by the company s management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside the control of management 
the company s management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on historical operations  future business plans and projected financial results  the terms of existing contracts  the observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the following discusses the company s critical accounting policies and estimates 
estimates 
operating results may be effected by certain accounting estimates 
the most sensitive and significant accounting estimates in the financial statements relate to customer rebates  asset valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  obsolete inventories  potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  and accruals for income taxes 
accruals for customer rebates are based on executed contracts and anticipated sales levels  which are monitored monthly 
management critically evaluates the potential realization of deferred income tax benefits as well as the likely usefulness of inventories and the collectability of accounts receivable 
accruals for income taxes or benefits often require interpretations of complex tax rules and regulations  which may be subsequently challenged 
there have been no significant changes in estimates for any period presented by the accompanying financial statements nor have there been any changes in accounting principles or practices

the company recognizes revenue from sales of its products when ownership transfers to the customers

intangible assets

deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the related debt 
patents and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful life 
the weighted average amortization period of intangible assets at december  is years 
the company reviews the value recorded for intangibles to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows 
impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
the projection of future cash flows requires the company to make estimates about the amount of future revenues 
the actual future results could differ significantly from these estimates  and resulting changes in the estimates of future cash flows could be significant and could affect the recoverability of intangible assets 
during  the company s net book value of intangible assets increased from  to  this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain trademarks as part of the company s acquisition of clauss cutlery

the renewal modified several characteristics of the original agreement  the most significant of which are reducing the interest rate to libor plus percent from libor plus  eliminating the borrowing base formula  allowing the company to borrow up to  regardless of its inventory and receivable levels  and extending the maturity of the loan to june  as of december    was outstanding and  was available for borrowing under this agreement 
it is estimated that all long term debt under this loan agreement will be paid off in however  the company may draw down additional funds under this loan agreement in the future

revised statement r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the revised statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and other third parties  eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
the revised statement is effective as of the first interim period beginning after june  acme will adopt the statement on july  as required 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had acme adopted statement in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share in the stock based compensation accounting policy note included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities 
this statement is effective for acme s fiscal year acme is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our overall results of operations or financial position 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company s debt portfolio and associated interest rates follow dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value current liabilities notes payable average interest rate long term debt including current portion amount at fixed rate average interest rate amount at variable rate    average interest rate interest rate risk the company s interest expense on debt is most sensitive to changes in the level of united states interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of these fluctuations  the company periodically evaluates alternative interest rate arrangements 
in  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank to minimize exposure to interest rate changes for million of debt 
the swap agreement expired on january  foreign currency risk the company s currency exposures vary  but are concentrated in the canadian dollar  british pound  and euro 
purchases by the hong kong office are in us dollars 
at times  the company utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge specific transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies 
the terms of these forward foreign exchange contracts are typically days to a year 
because the contracts are acquired for specific transactions  they are an effective hedge against fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency underlying the transaction 
at december   the company s canadian subsidiary had entered into a forward foreign exchange contract to reduce the risk of the company s canadian subsidiary s purchases of inventory in a currency other than the canadian subsidiary s functional currency  the canadian dollar 
the company has hedged the risk of foreign currency fluctuations for approximately million of inventory purchases in by the canadian subsidiary 
the fair value of the foreign exchange contract totaled approximately  at december  and is reported as a liability and a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the statement of stockholders equity 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
the company and its foreign subsidiaries utilize bank loans to finance their operations 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  foreign loans are denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary wherever possible 
inflation inflation had a negligible effect on the company s operations during and the company estimates that inflationary effects  in the aggregate  were generally recovered or offset through increased pricing or cost reductions in both years
