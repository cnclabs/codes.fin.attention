item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should be read in conjunction with these statements and the notes thereto 
restatement of financial statements pertaining to lease accounting during the company s fiscal closing process  the company determined that it would be required to restate its previously reported financial statements to correct the manner in which it accounts for leases  specifically the accounting for construction allowances  amortization periods related to leasehold improvements  and rent holidays 
historically  the company s previously reported financial statements reflected the unamortized portion of construction allowances as a reduction of property and equipment 
the company has restated its previously reported financial statements to reflect the unamortized portion of construction allowances as a deferred lease credit rather than as a reduction to the cost of leasehold improvements 
also  these construction allowances were being amortized over the asset life instead of the lease term 
accordingly  the company has corrected this error such that its amortization of construction allowances matches the lease term 

table of contents additionally  the company has determined that it should i conform the depreciable lives for leasehold improvements to the shorter of the economic life of the asset or the lease term used for calculating straight line rent and ii include option periods in the depreciable lives assigned to leasehold improvements and in the calculation of straight line rent expense in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
the company has corrected this error which results in an acceleration of depreciation for certain leasehold improvements and the recording of additional rent expense 
finally  the company has corrected the way in which it accounts for rent holidays on its store leases 
rent expense has been restated such that it is recognized on a straight line basis over a term that includes the store build out period  which for the company typically ranges from to days prior to the store opening 
previously the company calculated its straight line rent expense over a term commencing typically on the day on which the store opened for business 
the corrections noted above resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings as of february  of  reclassification pertaining to customer loyalty program during the fourth quarter of  the company reclassified certain prior year amounts for redemptions under the company s customer loyalty program 
the impact on prior years was a reduction to revenues of million and million for the years ended january  and february   respectively  a reduction to cost of sales  buying and occupancy of million and million for the years ended january  and february   respectively  and a reduction to selling  general  and administrative expenses of million and million  respectively 
the reclassification did not have any impact on operating income  net income  or net income per share 
the cost of the award issued under the customer loyalty program is recognized at the time of the initial customer purchase and is included in selling  general  and administrative expense 
the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections and reclassifications 
business overview fiscal was a challenging year for the company 
as the company entered  the retail economy was showing signs of improvement after three years of erratic performance 
the company was coming off three years of negative comparable store sales  having operated with reduced levels of inventory  which  while protecting gross margin rates  impacted top line sale growth 
the company  for the first time in three years  planned per square foot inventories up in  expecting that increased inventories  combined with sustained tight expense controls  would pull the company ahead of prior years sales productivity and earnings performance 
results were mixed 
the first half of the year  the spring season  yielded positive comparable store sales growth in both the first and second quarters  and combined with an unrelated tax benefit  produced record earnings per share 
this positive sales momentum fueled the company s optimism for sustained strength through the balance of the year  which proved to be far more challenging 
september  typically one of the company s most important months in terms of sales  proved difficult  impaired  the company believes  by a late labor day and compounded by the effects of multiple hurricanes in the southeastern part of the country 
while positive sales results in october recovered some of what was lost in september  the third quarter suffered from september s sales shortfall and the resulting markdowns needed to clear the additional inventory 
the company s fourth quarter  while producing positive comparable store sales  similarly suffered from the additional inventory commitments  yielding for the second quarter in a row an earnings per share decline over the prior year 
the company finished the year with positive comparable store sales growth of  below expectations but reversing a negative three year trend 

table of contents contributing to the company s disappointing comparable store sales growth was a disproportionate weakness in the company s dress assortment and its talbots kids concept which  combined  represented approximately of s sales plan 
while the company s core women s apparel businesses generated positive comparable store sales in each quarter in  and its talbots woman concept produced a comparable store sales gain  the dress assortment and the talbots kids business collectively lowered the company s comparable store sales growth by nearly four percentage points 
the company believes that actions taken in to reverse the negative trends in dresses and in talbots kids will serve to produce improved results in in terms of store expansion  the company opened a total of new stores in fiscal  with expansion in all concepts 
looking forward to fiscal  the company is currently planning to open a total of approximately new stores  representing approximately square footage growth 
this reduced new store expansion plan will allow additional resources to be directed to the company s existing store base  and in  the company has planned an ambitious store renovation and store refurbishment plan 
the company s total capital expenditures for fiscal were approximately million  in  the plan is for million in total capital expenditures  with approximately allocated to new and existing stores 
the company s catalog business  which represented of sales in  had its most profitable year ever  fueled by an improved catalog circulation strategy and a increase in online sales at talbots 
com 
online sales accounted for approximately of total catalog sales  up from in total inventories at the end of were million versus million at the end of approximately two thirds of this increase was due to the timing of receipts 
on a square foot basis  year end inventories were up in the company s us women s apparel stores over for  the company is planning for per square foot inventories to be higher year over year in the spring than in the fall  reflecting a more conservative inventory strategy for the back half of customer accounts receivable at the end of were million  up from million in account write offs  as a percent of sales  were at historic lows in  and the company earned a record in finance charge revenue in  up from million in notes payable stood at zero at the end of  the same as in  and long term debt was unchanged from at million 
cash flow from operations was million for the year  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales in fiscal total stock repurchases in fiscal were approximately million  and cash dividends increased to million from million in this was the tenth consecutive year that the company provided an increased dividend payout to shareholders 
in  the company will test brand extensions of its upper level assortment  talbots collection  with the introduction of talbots collection petites and talbots collection shoes in to stores currently offering talbots collection assortments 
the company will open additional stores in its core misses  petites and woman concepts  and after opening one additional mens store and one additional collection store in  will study these concepts further for their expansion potential 
results of operations the   and fiscal years all had weeks and ended on january   january  and february   respectively 
comparable stores are those that were open for at least one full fiscal year 
when a new talbots petites store  talbots woman store or talbots accessories shoes store is opened adjacent to or in close proximity to an existing comparable misses store  such misses store is excluded from the computation of comparable store sales for a period of months so that the performance of the full misses assortment may be properly compared

within the spring season  catalog sales are stronger in the first quarter  while retail store sales are slightly stronger in the second quarter 
within the fall season  catalog sales are generally stronger in the fourth quarter except in when the third quarter came in stronger 
this was partially due to weaker than anticipated performance in the fourth quarter sale event due to unusually low inventory levels 
retail store sales are the strongest in the fourth quarter 
the following table sets forth certain items in the company s unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales

fiscal quarter ended may  july  october  january  net sales cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses selling  general and administrative expenses operating income fiscal quarter ended may  august  november  january  net sales cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses selling  general and administrative expenses operating income the company s merchandising strategy focuses on liquidating seasonal inventory at the end of each selling season 
generally  the company achieves this by conducting major sale events at the end of the second and fourth quarters  followed by clearance selling in the company s outlet stores 
these events produce an increase in sales volume  however  since marking down the value of inventory increases expense  the company s cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales is increased 
merchandise inventories typically peak in the third quarter 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are strongly affected by the seasonality of sales 
the two key elements of this seasonality are the catalog circulation strategy  which affects catalog sales volume and produces commensurately high catalog production costs and the major semiannual sale events  which require additional store payroll  selling supplies  and advertising costs 
another factor is the store 
table of contents expansion program  which results in having more stores open in the fall than at the beginning of the year and  therefore  results in higher store payroll and operations related expenses 
the combined effect of the patterns of net sales  cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  described above  has generally produced higher operating income margins  as a percent of sales  in the first and third quarters 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of capital are cash flows from operating activities and line of credit facilities from five banks  with maximum available short term borrowings of million in the aggregate 
as of january  and january   the company had no amounts outstanding under these facilities

during  average inventory per square foot in our us women s stores was increased by over additionally  as of january   inventory levels were elevated compared to the prior year due to the timing of receipts which was caused by vendors shipping early due to the timing of the chinese new year  and the company s decision to request early delivery in order to safeguard against any potential issues related to the elimination of quotas 
during  on an inventory per square foot basis in our us women s stores  the company currently expects that spring inventory levels will be increased over by less than ten percent  and fall inventory levels will be decreased from by less than ten percent 
for the full year  the company currently expects average inventory levels per square foot to be approximately even with also contributing to the change in cash provided by operating activities was the change in levels of customer accounts receivable 
customer accounts receivable as of january  were million  an increase of million from january  customer accounts receivable as of january  were million  an increase of million from february  the increase in customer accounts receivable is a result of the overall increase in the company s fourth quarter sales  coupled with a increase in talbots charge card usage during december of cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in  consisting primarily of expenditures related to the opening of new stores and expanding and renovating existing stores

the company currently expects to open approximately new stores during and expects to spend approximately million in capital expenditures  the majority of which will relate to new store openings and expansions and renovations of existing stores 
the remaining amount will be used for other capital needs in the normal course of business 
the actual amount of such capital expenditures will depend on a number of 
table of contents factors  including the schedule of such activity during and the number  type  and timing of stores being opened  expanded  renovated and relocated 
cash used in financing activities during was million compared to million during the primary use of funds during was the company s repurchase of approximately million  or  shares  of its common stock under its stock repurchase programs at an average price of per share

as of january  and january   the company did not have any short term borrowings outstanding 
the company from time to time borrows under its line of credit facility for working capital and similar general corporate needs and expects that borrowings will occur during from time to time 
the company currently expects that borrowings during will be reasonably consistent with the company s primary ongoing cash requirements are currently expected to be for the financing of working capital buildups during peak selling seasons  capital expenditures for new stores and the expansion and renovation of existing stores and facilities  the purchase of treasury shares and the payment of any dividends that may be declared from time to time 
for the next twelve to eighteen months  the company believes its cash flows from operating activities and funds available under its credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its expected capital expenditures and working capital requirements  including debt service payments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  product returns  customer programs and incentives  retirement plans  the allowance for doubtful accounts and income taxes 
the estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results would differ from these estimates if actual events or experience were different from their assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require its most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
however  there is no assurance that such judgments and estimates will reflect actual results or that such estimates or their underlying assumptions may not need to change materially in the future to reflect actual experience 
inventory markdown reserve 
merchandise inventory is a significant portion of the company s balance sheet  representing approximately of total assets at january  talbots manages its inventory levels by holding four major sale events per year in its stores and catalog  consisting of two mid season sales and two end of season clearance sales 
no other major promotional sale events are typically held 
these events serve to liquidate remaining inventory at the end of each selling season after which remaining goods are transferred to the company s outlet stores 
at the end of each reporting period  reductions in gross margin and inventory are recorded for estimated future markdowns necessary to liquidate remaining markdown inventory 
the key factors influencing the reserve calculation are the overall level of markdown inventory at the end of the reporting period and the expectation of future markdowns on this same merchandise based on historical markdown percentages 
these percentages are reviewed regularly by comparing actual markdowns taken against previous estimates 
these results are then factored into future estimates 

table of contents if market conditions were to decline or customer acceptance of product is not favorable  talbots might be required to mark down inventory at a greater rate than estimated  possibly resulting in an incremental charge to earnings 
management believes that at january  and january   the markdown reserve was reasonable based on current markdown inventory levels  historical markdown trends and reasonable sales and markdown forecasts 
sales return reserve 
as part of the normal sales cycle  the company receives customer merchandise returns through both its catalog and store locations 
to account for the financial impact of this process  management estimates future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels  and projected future return levels 
the sales return reserve calculation consists of two separate components 
the stores component is based on an analysis that tracks daily sales over the preceding six months and actual returns processed against those sales 
a six month rolling average return rate is applied against the actual sales and the difference between the estimated returns and actual returns is booked as a reserve 
the model also applies a component to reduce the reserve for returns that result in merchandise exchanges 
these types of returns are tracked by the store systems and the estimate is applied against the return reserve 
the catalog component is based on a similar process except that sales are tracked by catalog and return rates are based on forecasted estimates for the entire life of the catalog and are based on current and historical return experience 
periodically both components of the calculation are validated by comparing the assumptions used to the actual returns processed 
management believes that at january  and january   the reserve was sufficient based on current sales return trends and reasonable return forecasts 
customer loyalty program 
talbots maintains a customer loyalty program in which customers receive appreciation awards based on reaching a specified purchase level on their talbots charge accounts 
customers may redeem their appreciation awards toward future merchandise purchases on the talbots charge card 
appreciation awards  by their terms  expire one year from the date of issuance 
typically  the customer receives one point for each of purchase 
each time a customer reaches points within the program year the customer is issued a appreciation award 
in and the company ran two promotional events each year where the customer was credited points for each purchased 
appreciation award expense is calculated as a percent of talbots charge sales and is based on expected redemption rates and is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
each month  the company performs an analysis that analyzes the accrual account balance and factors in the outstanding unredeemed awards  actual redemptions  and the level of award points earned 
the company also performs a monthly analysis of issuances and redemptions to identify trends in the redemption rate 
adjustments are made to the accrual based on trends and changes in the program 
several key statistics are monitored regularly  including expense as a percentage of sales  redemptions as a percentage of sales  and cumulative redemptions 
trends in these statistics are then factored into both the initial expense and the analysis of the liability account 
actual award grants and redemptions may vary from estimates based on actual customer responsiveness to the program and could result in additional expense 
management believes that at january  and january   its accrual was sufficient based on recent purchase levels and expected redemption levels 
retirement plans 
the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering substantially all full time employees  a non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan serp for certain key executives impacted by internal revenue code limits  and provides certain medical benefits for most retired employees under a postretirement medical plan 
in calculating its retirement plan obligations and related expense  the company makes various assumptions and estimates 
the annual determination of expense involves calculating the estimated total benefit ultimately payable to plan participants and allocates this cost to the periods in which services are expected to be rendered 
the plans are valued annually as of december st 

table of contents significant assumptions related to the calculation of the company s obligations include the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future  the expected long term rate of return on assets held by the pension plan  the average rate of compensation increase by certain plan participants  and the assumed healthcare trend rates on the postretirement medical plan 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based upon currently available information 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based in part on an analysis of corporate bonds with maturities matched to the plans anticipated cash flows 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of the company s obligation and net expense 
at december  and  the discount rate used was and  respectively 
to the extent that the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s obligations are decreased or increased  accordingly 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the pension obligation 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based principally on an analysis using ibbotson associates historical investment returns data for the two major classes of investments in which the company invests debt and equity securities 
this rate is utilized primarily in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than or more than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this loss or gain adjusts future pension expense over approximately years 
during both and  the company utilized as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees and is based on historical and expected compensation increases 
the company utilized a rate of for both the period beginning december  and for the period beginning december  this rate is utilized principally in calculating the retirement obligation and annual expense 
the assumed health care expense trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement medical plan 
the healthcare cost escalation rate is used to determine the postretirement obligation and annual expense 
at december  and  the company used and  respectively as initial cost escalation rates that gradually trend down to 
to the extent that these rates increase or decrease  the company s obligation and associated expense are decreased or increased accordingly 
at december  and  management believes that the assumptions used in the calculation of its retirement plans and postretirement medical plan liabilities were reasonable 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer accounts receivable consist entirely of outstanding receivables from the company s customers for their purchases made using the company s proprietary credit card 
talbots maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts providing for estimated charge offs resulting from the inability of talbots charge customers to make required payments 
delinquent accounts are generally charged off automatically after a period of delinquency 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
increases in the allowance are charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
the likelihood of collectibility of accounts receivable is evaluated based on a combination of factors including the level of accounts receivable balances  overall credit quality of the portfolio  historic charge off levels  and projected future charge off levels 
an analytical review of accounts receivable is performed each reporting period which categorizes delinquent accounts based on the number of days overdue 
bad debt estimates  by category  are then calculated based on historical collection rates 
for accounts that are not delinquent  a bad debt rate is imputed based on historical delinquency and collection rates 
in addition  bad debts resulting from factors other than delinquency  such as bankruptcy or fraud  are also factored into the calculation based on historical experience 
existing accounts are reviewed twice a year using standard industry credit score models by an independent credit scoring agency 
an adjustment to the reserve is calculated based on movement in the portfolio s credit scores and current aging trends 

table of contents if the creditworthiness of talbots customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additions to this reserve might be required 
management believes that at january  and january   the allowance for doubtful accounts balance was reasonable in light of portfolio balance  portfolio quality  historical charge offs  and reasonable charge off forecasts 
income taxes 
the company is routinely under audit by various domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
in response to this  management records accruals for estimates of audit adjustments by the taxing authorities 
the eventual resolution of these audits might include increases or decreases in liabilities 
management believes that at january  and january   the accruals for income taxes were reasonable
