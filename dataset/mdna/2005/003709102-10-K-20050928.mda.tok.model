business strategy our business plan calls for maximization of sales throughout our existing heating oil market areas by means of aggressive market penetration to recapture lost business as well as to attract new customers who have moved into our market area during the past two years 
in addition  our external strategy is to acquire related heating oil businesses  which strengthen and expand our current service area along with moving into planned new areas 
in this way  we can realize new residential and commercial business and take advantage of expected population growth in new market regions 
we also are in the process of becoming more vertically integrated through acquisition 
in addition to acquiring businesses in the core heating oil portion of our business  we are also developing relationships with potential acquisitions in the area of diesel fuel distribution  truck stop facilities  convenience store gasoline fueling stations  and crude oil refineries 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing the financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition sales of fuel and heating equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to the customer  and sales of equipment are recognized at the time of installation 
revenue from repairs and maintenance service is recognized upon completion of the service 
payments received from customers for heating equipment service contracts are deferred and amortized into income over the term of the respective service contracts  on a straight line basis  which generally do not exceed one year 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets we calculate our depreciation and amortization based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
when assets are put into service  we make estimates with respect to useful lives that we believe are reasonable 
however  subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
additionally  we assess our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
such indicators include changes in our business plans  a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset  an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired would necessarily involve numerous management estimates 
any impairment reviews and calculations would be based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans and long term investment decisions 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we routinely review our receivable balances to identify past due amounts and analyze the reasons such amounts have not been collected 
in many instances  such uncollected amounts involve billing delays and discrepancies or disputes as to the appropriate price or volumes of oil delivered  received or exchanged 
we also attempt to monitor changes in the creditworthiness of our customers as a result of developments related to each customer  the industry as a whole and the general economy 
based on these analyses  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and consider the reserve adequate  however  there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
revenue and expense accruals we routinely make accruals for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of compiling billing information  receiving third party information and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
we reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the income tax expense provision 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered 
the company assesses the likelihood of our deferred tax assets being recovered from future taxable income 
the company then provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which the company does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
any decrease in the valuation allowance could have a material impact on net income in the period in which such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following extraordinary expense items negatively affected net income for the year ending june  o one time non recurring expenses for deferred loss due to the newton accident  o accelerated amortization and prepayment penalty for early payoff of ups loan  o stock based compensation  o director s fees from prior years  o professional fees for legal related expenses due to the newton accident supplemental government filings 
 total  the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated and changes from period to period of certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
period to period changes for year ended june  vs 
vs 
net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expense loss income from operations interest and other income interest expense directors fees gain loss on sale of assets gain on insurance recovery 
other income expense legal fees relating to other expense income loss from continuing operations before income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations not meaningful fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for fiscal increased approximately million or over fiscal this increase can be attributed primarily the pass through of fuel oil costs customers offset by somewhat lower gallons sales during the period as a result of a slight decline in heating degree days from last season and the initial impact of marketing changes in the way the company sells to its discount customers 
the company did not have the use of its facility in newton  new jersey  due to the march accident 
gross profit margins for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the decrease in margin was the result of the dramatically rising product costs during the period 
retail pricing was adjusted as necessary to cover most of the increases while continuing to maintain the company s competitive position in the marketplace 
gross profit margin was also affected by a strong increase in sales of our priceenergy subsidiary in able s present market area 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased by approximately  or compared to fiscal the company attributes this decrease primarily to a reduction in advertising and marketing of approximately  related to more effective advertising campaigns and a reduction in bad debt expense of approximately  related to increased collection efforts during the period 
depreciation and amortization expense remained relatively flat for fiscal as compared to fiscal other income expenses increased to a net expense of  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase is primarily related to a write off of costs related to insurance claims of approximately  and directors fees of  these costs were offset by an increase in interest income of approximately  and reduction in interest expense of approximately  related to debt pay offs and refinancing 
operating loss for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the net improvement in our operating loss for the year was directly related to the volatile market pricing and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our effective tax rate for fiscal is negligible 
the difference in the company s effective tax rate from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to a valuation allowance provided for all deferred tax assets 
current period income tax expense of  represents minimum state tax liabilities 
net loss for fiscal was million compared to  for fiscal during fiscal the company recognized a gain on sale of the operating assets of able propane in the amount of million  which reduced its net loss from million 
excluding this gain the net loss from fiscal to fiscal decreased by approximately  this decrease in the net loss is primarily due to gross profit increase and selling  general and administrative expense decreases offset by increases in other expenses 
fiscal compared to fiscal the company reported revenues of  for fiscal  which was a small decrease of  from the prior year s revenues of  for the same period 
this decrease can be attributed primarily to somewhat lower gallons sales during the period as a result of a decline in heating degree days from the previous season and the initial impact of marketing changes in the way the company sells to its discount customers 
the company did not have the use of its facility in newton  new jersey  due to the explosion in march  which negatively affected service levels to some of the customers in the sussex county  new jersey  delivery area 
gross profit margin  as a percentage of revenues  for fiscal  decreased by from  to  the decrease in margin was the result of the dramatically rising product costs during the months of october  november and december 
retail pricing was adjusted appropriately to cover most of the increases while continuing to maintain the company s competitive position in the marketplace 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  as a percent of sales  increased by from in year ending june  to during the year ending june  the company attributes this increase to higher insurance rates due to an unsettled insurance market  payroll costs  advertising  outside consulting and legal fees 
operating loss for fiscal was  as compared to the company s income of  for fiscal this operating loss for the year was directly related to the volatile market pricing and increased costs related to the explosion and fire in newton  new jersey on march   and increased operating costs such as insurance 
net loss for fiscal was  as compared to income of  in fiscal this loss was directly related to an increase in operating costs  warmer temperature for the season  and a lower gross margin 
operational efficiencies volume in gallons is the true gauge by which increases or decreases can be measured on a year to year basis as the volatility in the cost of the commodity can present an inexact picture of real growth 
total gallons for fiscal vs 
fiscal were down by 
this is primarily the result of slightly lower heating degree days in the season vs 
the season 
heating degree days are the industry measurement used to relate each day s temperatures during the heating season to the demand for fuel used for heat 
other reasons for the year to year gallons decline were the fact that the march explosion  which affected our newton fuel depot  has left this facility still in an out of service condition 
we are currently working diligently to get this location back in service  or a substitute acquisition facility  before the beginning of the upcoming heating season 
the ability to use this  or some other location in the area  will greatly improve our service level to the sussex county delivery area 
we are also enhancing our communications to our will call customers by offering able oil express 
we believe that by focusing our efforts on each specific segment of customer  we can build overall gallons sales 
gallons increases could also be realized through the successful completion of several acquisitions that are anticipated for completion in the current fiscal year 
these acquisitions  if completed  could significantly add to our company s overall sales volume as measured in gallons as well as dollars of revenue 
the company believes that it will continue to increase the utilization of existing personnel and equipment  thus continuing to reduce expenses as a percent of sales  and increasing profitability  within its current business configuration 
the redefining of the company s organizational chart and associated position descriptions by assigning duties to best suit the organization s growth will further enhance this increased utilization 
moreover  the company has completed the process of implementing a new versyss now adds north operating system to further streamline operations and information processing 
the company understands the importance of controlling expenses at every level and as such  has enlisted the support of an outside consultant to assist in the integration of a new comprehensive operating budget that will interface with the new adds north computer operating system 
the company believes that these changes will enable management  through enhanced reporting capabilities  to quickly respond to changing trends in sales and expenses 
the combination of the new operating system and the detailed budget program and reporting now provides all levels of management with real time results not previously available 
the company s margin strategy will be strengthened as it plans to shift some of the sales volume to other area dealers within the priceenergy subsidiary to handle highly discounted non service related home heating oil sales 
this change will permit able oil co 
to focus and grow its higher margin automatic delivery customer base using its moniker of full service at discount prices  while the priceenergy entity will cater to those customers looking for the lowest possible retail price either on line or over the phone 
the company believes that this further segmentation of its customer base will be successful in increasing overall profitability while enhancing customer appeal 
the company has identified several discreet customer segments that prefer varying levels of service from the company 
by better aligning the company s product offerings to match the desires of these customer segments  the company believes that it will be able to capture a larger market share 
the company implemented a service billing methodology known as flat rate pricing  an approach similar to that used in the automobile repair industry 
this system provides the company s sales and service personnel a package approach to selling service  and provides the customer with an easy to understand invoice 
this policy is consistent with the company s customer segmentation strategy  permitting different retail prices for different customer segments  based upon their choice of service level desired 
this system will interface with the company s automated dispatch communications program that was introduced last year 
since the flat rate pricing has now been fully rolled out  the company s service segment is now operating as a profit center instead of a support vehicle to the fuel delivery side of the business 
warrensburg  new york operational enhancements the company is in the process of completing operational changes to its warrensburg  new york business  which will permit the consolidation of all daily operations on to one modern facility located in the newly developed warrensburg industrial park 
the company s previous operations on its lake george property have been moved to the new site and the lake george location has been sold 
the proceeds from the sale of this location have provided funding for the new operations at the industrial park 
when completed this fall  the new fuel depot and sales office will house the local sales and administrative support personnel as well as operations and fuel storage for heating oil  kerosene  propane gas  and diesel fuel 
a new modular office and tank farm has been completed on the new property and the company has terminated its leased office space on mail street in warrensburg 
by having all operations combined in the new location we will have the ability to grow the business more effectively as well as handle a greater volume of all products 
recently implemented technological procedures the company has introduced additional customer service technology to its rockaway call and administrative center during the past year 
management has completed improvements to its existing telephone hardware and in house call management 
the company s call center environment now provides he ability to respond to changing call patterns  both higher and lower  without the expense of clerical over staffing to meet unrealized needs 
new software gives customers the option of placing an order via a voice activated technology 
this enables customers who simply wish to refill their fuel tank  the opportunity to quickly place an order hours a day without the help of a live customer service representative 
this system has been a contributing factor in our reduction of clerical sg a expense for the past fiscal year 
the company is now beginning full implementation of the recently announced automated dispatch technology  which provides management with the ability to communicate with service technicians instantaneously 
this system is also now performing billing functions at the customer s location as well as documenting payment data instantaneously 
additionally  management is now aware of the status of every on duty worker and is able to obtain real time reporting for stand by  en route  and service work time 
this system has enabled the company to maximize scheduling opportunities and eliminate service technician down time 
priceenergy operating subsidiary the company s operating subsidiary  priceenergy  with its modern order processing platform  has been in full operation for over four years now 
this revolutionary proprietary technology is fully automated and allows for the removal of the inefficiencies associated with traditional heating oil companies in this industry 
priceenergy has generated over million gallons in business this year  which were delivered by the growing priceenergy dealer network 
this is an increase of over vs 
prior year 
in december of  priceenergy began sales of home heating oil in the initial bj s wholesale club 
gallons sold through this venue have been steadily increasing 
the company is excited about these types of opportunities with channel partners such as bj s and is looking to expand the channel partner concept 
the company is currently in the process of upgrading the priceenergy operating platform to enable it to handle even greater volumes of business as well as provide new services to its customers including an on line or i catalog selling energy related items for home and business 
explosion and fire on march   able energy experienced an explosion and fire at its newton  new jersey facility which resulted in the destruction of an office building on the site  as well as damage to company vehicles and neighboring properties 
while there were no serious injuries  the newton facility has been in an out of service condition since the incident 
the company is currently not processing deliveries from the newton  new jersey  facility as the newton board of adjustment originally denied the company s application to repair and rebuild the facility on the grounds that the zoning laws covering the newton  new jersey  property had been changed following the accident 
the company appealed the board s decision in august of  and was granted immediate permission to make some building repairs and restore power to the underground cathodic protection system 
the company has effectuated these repairs and will continue to move the legal process forward in order to regain use of the facility 
it is anticipated that the company will have use of either its newton facility or an alternative location in the area soon 
this would enable the company to realize savings in delivery mileage and driver time as a result of being able to handle this area s business needs locally 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our principal sources of working capital have been the proceeds from public and private placements of securities and notes payable 
since our inception  sales of securities  including the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  have generated approximately million less applicable expenses 
we had a working capital deficit of approximately  at june  compared to working capital of approximately  at june  and ratios of current assets to current liabilities of 
as of june  and as of june  the working capital decrease of approximately  was primarily due to a net loss of approximately million and capital expenditures of approximately million 
this decrease was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of common stock through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants of approximately million  net proceeds from note payable  long term debt and lines of credit of approximately million  depreciation and amortization included in net loss of approximately million and non cash compensation included in net loss of approximately million 
in may we entered into a  line of credit agreement with entrepreneurs growth capital  llc 
the line is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventories 
outstanding balances under the loan bear interest at an annual rate equal to the citibank s prime rate plus 
as of june  approximately million was outstanding and  was available under this credit line 
on july   the company consummated a financing with a group of lenders 
pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement  the company sold variable rate convertible debentures in the amount of million 
the debentures shall be repaid within two years from the date of issuance with interest payable at a rate per annum equal to libor  plus  which on july  was plus  or 
the interest is payable quarterly on the first of january  april  july  and october 
the debentures may be converted at the option of the purchasers into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the amount of shares to be issued at such conversion will be  in addition  the purchasers shall have the right to receive five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the market value of the company s common stock on july  was per share 
the debenture conversion price of is of the market value 
closing expenses related to this transaction totaled  including a  broker fee and  in various legal expenses 
on july   the company made a loan of  to all american plazas  inc which is the largest shareholder of the company 
the funds were disbursed from the financing proceeds of million described above 
under the note  the loan bears interest at per annum and is secured by the  shares of able energy  inc common stock owned by all american plazas  inc 
the interest rate of the company on its million of convertible debentures is currently  as noted above 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with cash and investments  and availability under our credit line will be sufficient to fund our current level of growth and our existing commitments at least through fiscal however  to the extent the expansion of our operations requires significant additional resources  we may be required to seek additional financing 
no assurance can be given that such financing would be available on terms that would be acceptable to us 
material commitments the following schedule summarizes our contractual cost obligations as of june  in the periods indicated 
payments due by period contractual more than obligations total less than year years years years long term debt      capital lease obligations     operating leases   unconditional purchase obligations   other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations      excluded from the table above is estimated interest payments on long long term debt and capital lease obligations of approximately    and  for the periods less than year  years  years  and more than years  respectively 
additional factors that may affect future results seasonality the company s operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations  with a majority of the company s business occurring in the late fall and winter months 
approximately of the company s revenues are earned and received from october through march  most of such revenues are derived from the sale of home heating products  primarily home heating fuel oil 
however  the seasonality of the company s business is offset  in part  by an increase in revenues from the sale of hvac products and services  diesel and gasoline fuels during the spring and summer months due to the increased use of automobiles and construction apparatus 
from may through september  able oil can experience considerable reduction of retail heating oil sales 
similarly  able energy s new york propane operations can experience up to an decrease in heating related propane sales during the months of april to september  this is offset somewhat by increased sales of propane gas used for pool heating  heating of domestic hot water in homes and fuel for outdoor cooking equipment 
over of able melbourne s revenues are derived from the sale of diesel fuel for construction vehicles  and commercial and recreational sea going vessels during florida s fishing season  which begins in april and ends in november 
only a small percentage of able melbourne s revenues are derived from the sale of home heating fuel 
most of these sales occur from december through march  florida s cooler months 
future operating results 
future operating results  which reflect management s current expectations may be impacted by a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated herein 
these factors include worldwide economic and political conditions  terrorist activities  industry specific factors  and governmental agencies 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
as demand for our services has increased in recent periods  our quarterly revenue and operating results have become highly dependent on the timing of contracts signed and programs implemented during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast
