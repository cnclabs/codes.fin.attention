item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
in this discussion  the words ppd  we  our and us refer to pharmaceutical product development  inc  together with its subsidiaries where appropriate 
forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
forward looking statements include statements concerning plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events or performance  expectations  predictions  assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical facts 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as might  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue  or the negative of these terms  or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
these statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates that could be inaccurate and that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results might differ materially due to a number of factors  including those listed in potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price and in part i item business factors that might affect our business or stock price 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
executive overview because our revenues are dependent on a relatively small number of industries and clients  we closely monitor the market for our services 
for a discussion of the trends affecting our market  see item business trends affecting the drug discovery and development industry 
our new business authorizations for the first two quarters of were lower than we expected 
in response  we refocused our business development and operational efforts to increase new business authorizations 
we believe that those efforts  together with a stronger market for cro services in the second half of and in  resulted in increased new authorizations for those periods 
while we cannot predict the demand for cro services in  we believe the overall historical market drivers for our industry are intact 
to grow authorizations in  we plan to focus on our business development efforts  including increasing the percentage of successful proposals  and the delivery of timely  high quality services to our clients 
we continue to believe there are several specific opportunities for growth in we currently conduct a significant amount of government sponsored research and plan to continue our efforts to win new opportunities in this market 
our latin american and european phase ii through iv units had an excellent year in and we believe there are opportunities for continued growth in these areas 
we have also experienced an increase in the demand for our phase i services and are expanding our phase i clinic in austin  texas to beds to enhance our ability to service large  complex studies 
this expansion should be completed in april in  the demand for our bioanalytical and gmp services increased and we have expanded our gmp laboratory facilities and invested in new equipment to meet this increased demand 
finally  we also believe the demand for our post marketing development services will continue to grow and we will also seek to expand our medical device services 
we review various metrics  including period to period growth in backlog  new authorizations  cancellation rates  revenue  margins and earnings  to evaluate our financial performance 
in  we had record new authorizations of billion  an increase of over the cancellation rate for was compared to in on a net basis  authorizations were up in compared to backlog grew from billion as of december  to billion as of december  backlog by client type as of december  was pharmaceutical  biotech and government other 
backlog by client type as of december  was pharmaceutical  biotech and government other 
this change in the composition of our backlog from to reflects an increase in new authorizations from biotech clients 
net revenue by client type for the year ended december  was pharmaceutical  biotech and government other 
top therapeutic areas by net revenue for the year ended december  were oncology  anti infective anti viral  central nervous system  circulatory cardiovascular and endocrine metabolic 
for a detailed discussion of our revenue  margins  earnings and other financial results for the year ended december   see results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  below 

table of contents capital expenditures for the year ended december  totaled approximately million 
the majority of the capital expenditures were for software  computer hardware  the expansion of our phase i unit  and new equipment for our bioanalytical and gmp labs 
we bought new liquid chromatography mass spectrometry instruments in  bringing our total to in addition to investing in our growing business  we are also focused on improving the efficiency of our operations by streamlining training matrices and clinical procedural documents  decreasing the number of documents needed for study initiation  centralizing regulatory document collection and rolling out a new clinical trial management system 
with respect to our discovery sciences segment  our compound collaboration arrangements allow us to leverage our resources and global drug development expertise to create new opportunities for growth and to share the risks and potential rewards of drug development 
in  in addition to furthering existing collaborations with alza corporation  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  and bayer ag  we entered into new collaborations with syrrx and chemokine therapeutics 
for a discussion of these compound partnering arrangements  see item business our services our discovery sciences group compound partnering programs above 
one of our primary goals in the discovery business at the beginning of was to end the year with four drug candidates in clinical development  and we delivered on that objective 
in september  we filed an investigational new drug application for one syrrx dpp iv inhibitor and started the phase i trial for that inhibitor in late october this inhibitor is now in phase ib  which is when the drug is first administered to subjects suffering from the indication 
we currently anticipate starting phase ii trials in april in december  we filed an investigational new drug application for a second dpp iv inhibitor and a phase i study for this second dpp iv inhibitor is scheduled to begin in april in february  takeda pharmaceutical company limited announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire of the equity of syrrx  inc at this time  we do not know what impact  if any  this acquisition will have on the dpp iv collaboration with syrrx 
in addition  alza corporation submitted an nda for dapoxetine in december the fda accepted the dapoxetine nda for filing in february as a result of these arrangements and the progression of our pipeline  we expect to incur significant r d expense during furthermore  in addition to progressing our existing collaborations  we will continue to evaluate opportunities for new collaborations and investments that we believe will help us achieve our mid to long term growth objectives 
in february  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of surromed  inc s biomarker business 
the acquired business consists of services and technologies that support drug discovery and drug development by identifying biomarkers using biological  chemical and bioinformatics expertise and technologies 
the new business is part of our discovery sciences segment and will expand our discovery business by adding biomarker discovery and patient sample analysis to the collection of services offered by us 
acquisitions in  we completed four acquisitions 
for details regarding these acquisitions  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in july  ppd acquired eminent research systems  a clinical research organization specializing in medical device development  and clinsights  a company affiliated with eminent through common ownership that provides a range of post market services to medical device and related pharmaceutical companies and operates proprietary web sites for the dissemination of medical information  online research and product marketing 
as a result  eminent and clinsights are now part of the development segment of ppd 
their results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations as of and since july   the effective date of the acquisitions 
ppd acquired eminent and clinsights for total consideration of million in cash 
under the terms of the merger agreement  the original aggregate purchase price of million was reduced by million in the first quarter of as a result of an adjustment to the purchase price based on eminent s closing balance sheet 
we accounted for all of the acquisitions in and under the purchase method of accounting  utilizing appropriate fair value techniques to allocate the purchase price based on estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities 
the results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations as of and since the effective dates of the acquisitions 
for further details regarding these acquisitions  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents investments in march  ppd loaned oriel therapeutics million in the form of debt that is convertible into oriel therapeutics series b preferred stock at per share 
the loan is secured by a first lien on oriel s assets 
in january  we purchased million shares of accentia biopharmaceuticals  inc series e convertible preferred stock for million 
at that time  we also received a class a and class b warrant  each to purchase up to an additional million shares of series e convertible preferred stock for per share 
in september  we entered into a royalty stream purchase agreement with accentia 
under the terms of that agreement  we paid accentia a one time cash payment of million for the right to receive royalties on future sales of antifungal products for the treatment of chronic sinusitis 
the royalties under this agreement equal of the net sales of antifungal products sold prior to fda approval and of the net sales of these products sold after fda approval  if fda approval is obtained 
in january  ppd exercised the class a warrant of accentia for the purchase of an additional million shares of series e convertible preferred stock for million 
in february  accentia filed a registration statement with the sec for its proposed initial public offering of its common stock 
accentia proposes to sell in this public offering  in addition to shares for its own account  up to million of common stock issuable to us upon conversion of million shares of the series e convertible preferred stock held by us 
as a result of management s quarterly evaluations of our equity investments  during we recorded a charge to earnings of million for an other than temporary decline in the fair market value of our investment in chemokine therapeutics corp 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these investments 
restructuring charges and gain on sale of assets in  we recorded a million restructuring charge associated with exiting our chemistry facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
these charges include lease payments and termination costs  net of sublease rentals  of approximately million and a loss on sale of assets used in our chemistry services of approximately million 
the lease termination liability will be paid over the remaining life of the lease which will end in in july  we announced the restructuring of our discovery sciences group 
in connection with this restructuring  we consolidated our discovery sciences operations into our morrisville  north carolina and middleton  wisconsin facilities  and discontinued offering functional genomics services in menlo park  california 
in the third quarter  we incurred  recorded and paid a charge to earnings of million for this restructuring 
restructuring charges included million for one time termination benefits  million for facility charges and million for other related charges 
as a part of the restructuring  we purchased million shares of surromed  inc series f convertible preferred stock in exchange for million in cash and million in tangible assets and intellectual property from our menlo park operations 
the value of the tangible assets and intellectual property was based on an independent appraisal 
we recorded a gain on sale of assets of million as a result of this transaction 
the majority of the remaining tangible assets of the restructured operations were transferred to our cro phase ii through iv division and the remaining discovery sciences operations 
new business authorizations and backlog new business authorizations  which are sales of our services  are reflected in backlog when we enter into a contract or letter of intent or receive a verbal commitment 
authorizations can vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and contracts generally have terms ranging from several months to several years 
we recognize revenue on these authorizations as services are performed 
our new authorizations for the years ended december   and were  million   million and  million  respectively 
our backlog consists of new business authorizations for which the work has not started but is anticipated to begin in the near future  and contracts in process that have not been completed 
as of december   the remaining duration of the contracts in our backlog ranged from one month to months with an average duration of months 
amounts included in backlog represent future revenue and exclude revenue that we have previously recognized 
once work begins on a project included in backlog  net revenue is recognized over the life of the contract 
however  there can be no assurance that our backlog will ever be recognized as revenue 
our backlog as of december   and was million   million and  million  respectively 

table of contents results of operations revenue recognition we record revenue from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance basis in our development group 
to measure performance on a given date  we compare direct costs incurred through that date to estimated total contract direct costs 
we believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contractual obligations because the costs relate primarily to the amount of labor incurred to perform the service 
changes to the estimated total contract direct costs result in a cumulative adjustment to the amount of revenue recognized 
for time and materials contracts in both our development group and discovery sciences group  we recognize revenues as hours are worked  multiplied by the applicable hourly rate 
for our phase i and laboratory businesses  we recognize revenues from unitized contracts as subjects or samples are tested  multiplied by the applicable unit price 
in connection with the management of multi site clinical trials  we pay  on behalf of our customers  fees to investigators and test subjects as well as other out of pocket costs for items such as travel  printing  meetings and couriers 
our clients reimburse us for these costs 
as required by eitf  amounts paid by us as a principal for out of pocket costs are included in direct costs as reimbursable out of pocket expenses and the reimbursements we receive as a principal are reported as reimbursed out of pocket revenue 
in our statements of operations  we combine amounts paid by us as an agent for out of pocket costs with the corresponding reimbursements  or revenue  we receive as an agent 
during the years ended december   and  fees paid to investigators and other fees we paid as an agent and the associated reimbursements were approximately  and million  respectively 
most of the contracts for our development group can be terminated by our clients either immediately or after a specified period following notice by the client 
these contracts typically require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study  fees earned to date  and in some cases  a termination fee or some portion of the fees or profit that we could have earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
therefore  revenue recognized prior to cancellation does not generally require a significant adjustment upon cancellation 
if we determine that a loss will result from the performance of a fixed price contract  the entire amount of the estimated loss is charged against income in the period in which such determination is made 
the discovery sciences group also generates revenue from time to time in the form of milestone payments in connection with licensing of compounds 
milestone payments are only recognized as revenue if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer  payment received and continued performance of future research and development services related to that milestone are not required 
recording of expenses we generally record our operating expenses among the following categories direct costs  research and development  selling  general and administrative  depreciation  and amortization 
direct costs consist of appropriate amounts necessary to carry out the revenue and earnings process  and include direct labor and related benefit charges  other costs directly related to contracts  an allocation of facility and information technology costs  and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
direct costs  as a percentage of net revenues  tend to and are expected to fluctuate from one period to another as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involved in the hundreds of studies being conducted during any period of time 
research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of patent expenses  labor and related benefit charges associated with personnel performing internal research and development work  supplies associated with this work  consulting services and an allocation of facility and information technology costs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges  sales  advertising and promotional expenses  recruiting and relocation expenses  administrative travel  an allocation of facility and information technology costs  and costs related to operational employees performing administrative tasks 
depreciation expenses consist of depreciation costs recorded on a straight line method  based on estimated useful lives of to years for buildings  five years for laboratory equipment  two to five years for software  computers and related equipment and five to ten years for furniture and equipment  except for airplanes  which we depreciate over years 
we depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the life of the relevant lease or the useful life of the improvement 
we depreciate property under capital leases over the life of the lease or the service life  whichever is shorter 
amortization expenses consist of amortization costs recorded on intangible assets on a straight line method over the life of the intangible assets

the development group s operations 
table of contents generated net revenue of million  which accounted for of total net revenue for the increase in the development group s net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the level of global cro phase ii through iv services we provided in as compared to net revenue for the development group also increased by approximately million due to the effect of the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound based on revenue translated at the average exchange rates in the discovery sciences group generated net revenue of million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in the discovery sciences net revenue was mainly attributable to the reduction in net revenue from chemistry services  which we stopped offering in the first quarter of in both and  we received a million dapoxetine milestone payment from alza 
alza submitted an nda for dapoxetine in december the fda accepted this nda for filing in february as a result  we are entitled to receive a one time milestone payment of million from alza within days of the fda s acceptance of the nda 
total direct costs increased million to million in primarily as the result of an increase in the development group direct costs 
development group direct costs increased million to million in the primary reason for this increase was an increase in personnel costs of million 
personnel costs increased due to hiring additional employees in our global cro phase ii through iv division  increased incentive compensation accruals and increased costs in our foreign operations due to the weakening of the us dollar 
in  incentive compensation accruals were lower than our normal accrual levels as a result of our financial and operating performance in that period 
the remaining million of this increase in development direct costs primarily consisted of increased facility costs related to the increase in personnel and increased subcontractor costs to support increased revenues 
discovery sciences direct costs decreased million to million in the higher costs in related primarily to a million milestone payment for dapoxetine to eli lilly company that did not occur again in because we acquired the dapoxetine patents from lilly in december gross margin from the development segment was in compared to in the majority of this decrease was attributable to increased incentive compensation accruals and increased costs in our foreign operations due to the weakening of the us dollar 
the remaining variance relates to expected fluctuations from one period to another as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involved in the hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time 
research and development  or r d  expenses decreased million to million in in the fourth quarter of  we acquired from eli lilly company the patents for the compound dapoxetine for development in the field of genitourinary disorders 
ppd paid lilly million in cash and agreed to pay lilly a royalty of on annual sales of dapoxetine  if any  in excess of million 
the million payment to lilly was recorded to research and development expenses because dapoxetine was still in development and had not been approved for sale in any country 
excluding that payment  r d expenses increased million in compared to as a result of increased spending in connection with our existing compound partnering arrangements 
the increased spending on compound partnering arrangements was offset by the decrease in functional genomics and chemistry r d expense as we ceased providing the services in the third quarter of and first quarter of  respectively 
in  r d expenses for our functional genomics and chemistry services operations totaled million 
we expect to incur significant r d expenses in in connection with our existing compound partnering arrangements 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses increased million to million in as a percentage of total net revenue  sg a expenses increased slightly to in compared to in the increase in sg a expenses includes additional personnel costs of million 
personnel costs increased by million  due to increased incentive compensation accruals and million related the to foreign currency translation effect of the weakening us dollar mentioned previously 
the remaining million increase in personnel costs related to training costs for new personnel  higher levels of operations infrastructure to manage direct personnel and changes in utilization levels 
the increase in sg a costs also includes an increase of million for recruiting costs due to an increase in the number of new hires in compared to and an increase of million in accounting and auditing fees due to new regulatory requirements 

table of contents depreciation expense increased million to million in the increase was related to the depreciation of the property and equipment we acquired to accommodate our growth 
capital expenditures were million in capital expenditures primarily included additional spending in the development group on software  computer hardware  and additional scientific equipment for our phase i and lab units and a million purchase of land in connection with our plans to construct a new corporate headquarters building in wilmington  north carolina 
amortization expense decreased million to million in as a result of the decrease of million in amortization expense for our intangible backlog related to the acquisition of mrl in becoming fully amortized in the first quarter of this was offset by an increase in amortization of million related to the license agreement and royalty rights agreement in the discovery sciences group that were placed into service during the second quarter of and the third quarter of operating income increased million to million in as a percentage of net revenue  operating income increased to of net revenue in from in operating income in includes the million payment to lilly and a million charge related to the restructuring of the discovery sciences group offset by a million gain on the sale of assets 
the aggregate impact of these items was a million reduction in operating income for operating income in includes a million restructuring charge associated with exiting our chemistry facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
operating income in was also negatively impacted by approximately million due to the effect of the us dollar weakening relative to the euro  the british pound and the brazilian real 
during  we recorded a foreign currency hedging gain of million  resulting in a net impact to operating income of million attributable to foreign currency transactions 
although these currency movements increased net revenue in the aggregate  the negative impact on operating income is attributable to dollar denominated contracts for services rendered in countries other than the united states 
in these cases  revenue is not impacted by the weakening of the us dollar  but the costs associated with performing these contracts  which are paid in local currency  are negatively impacted when translated to the us dollar 
during  we recorded a charge to earnings for an other than temporary decline in the fair market value of our investment in chemokine therapeutics corp 
of million 
we deemed our investment in chemokine to be impaired as a result of the issuance of shares to new investors at a lower valuation than our original investment 
during  we recorded charges to earnings for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of our investments in slil biomedical of million  spotlight health of million  signature bioscience formerly primecyte of million and biodelivery sciences of million 
we determined that slil and signature bioscience were impaired primarily as a result of the market condition of their respective industries  historical and projected performance and expected cash needs of the individual companies 
we recorded the write down of our investment in spotlight health primarily based on its historical and projected financial performance and issuance of shares to a new investor at a lower valuation 
biodelivery sciences is a publicly traded company  so we based the write down of our investment in that company on the closing price of its securities as of december  although these securities had traded above cost for short periods of time throughout  we believe that due to the uncertainty of biodelivery sciences strategic direction  the decline in value was other than temporary and therefore we recorded the charge to earnings 
prior to the third quarter of  we recorded market fluctuations through other comprehensive income 
our provision for income taxes increased million to million in our effective income tax rate for was compared to for during the second quarter of  our effective tax rate was positively impacted by a million tax benefit for a decrease in a valuation allowance for capital loss carryforwards that we expect to be able to utilize 
the remaining difference in our effective rates for and is also due to the change in the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
net income of million in represents an increase of million from million in net income per diluted share of in represents an increase from net income per diluted share in net income for includes a charge of million for impairment of equity investments 
this charge  together with the payment to lilly of million and the restructuring charges of million offset by the gain on sale of assets of million  resulted in an aggregate impact of million on net income  net of tax

table of contents the discovery sciences group generated net revenue of million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in the discovery sciences net revenue was mainly attributable to a reduction in net revenue from functional genomics and chemistry services of million and million  respectively  due to fewer contracts for those services in we discontinued functional genomics and chemistry services in the third quarter of and the first quarter of  respectively 
the decreases in discovery sciences net revenue were partially offset by a milestone payment of million that we earned under our sublicense agreement with alza as a result of the initiation of phase iii clinical trials of dapoxetine  and by an increase of million in net revenue associated with our preclinical oncology operation 
in early january  we amended our sublicense agreement with alza 
under the terms of the amendment  alza made a cash payment to us of million in the first quarter of total direct costs increased million to million in development group direct costs increased million to million in this increase resulted primarily from increased personnel costs of million due to hiring additional employees in our global cro phase ii through iv division and to annual salary increases

biodelivery sciences is a publicly traded company  and we based the write down of that investment on the closing price of its securities as of december  although these securities had traded above cost for short periods of time throughout  we believe that due to the uncertainty of biodelivery sciences strategic direction  the decline in value as of each of these periods was other than temporary and therefore we recorded the charges to earnings

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments 
our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  expansion of services  possible acquisitions  geographic expansion  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we have historically funded our operations and growth  including acquisitions  with cash flow from operations  leasing arrangements  borrowings and sales of our stock 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in financial instruments that are rated a or better by standard poor s or moody s and earn interest at market rates 
in  our operating activities provided million in cash as compared to million last year 
the increase in cash flow from operations is primarily due to a million increase in income before provision for

net proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan totaling million were partially offset by million in repayments of long term debt and million in repayments of capital lease obligations 
working capital as of december  was million  compared to million at december  the increase in working capital was due primarily to the increase in cash of million  increase in short term investments of million and the increase in accounts receivable of million which were partially offset by the increase in payables to investigators of million  an increase in other accrued expenses of million  and an increase in unearned income of million 
the number of days revenue outstanding in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net of unearned income  also known as dso  were and days as of december  and december   respectively 
dso is calculated by dividing accounts receivable and unbilled services less unearned income by average daily gross revenue for the period presented 
over the past three years  our year to date dso has fluctuated between days and days 
we expect dso will fluctuate in the future depending on the mix of contracts performed within a quarter  the level of investigator advances and unearned income  and our success in collecting receivables 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan for certain employees and former employees in the united kingdom 
this pension plan was closed to new participants as of december  the projected benefit obligation for the benefit plan at december  and december   as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  was million and million  respectively  and the value of the plan assets was million and million  respectively 
as a result  the plan was under funded by million in and by million in  net of december contributions of million for and it is likely that the amount of our contributions to the plan could increase in future years 
the amount of contributions to the plan for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
we expect the pension cost to be recognized in our financial statements will decrease slightly from the million in to approximately million in the expense to be recognized in future periods could increase depending upon the change in fair market value of the plan assets and change in the projected benefit obligation 
a decrease in the market value of plan assets and or declines in interest rates are likely to cause the amount of the under funded status to increase 
after completion of the actuarial valuations in we could be required to record an additional reduction to shareholders equity 
we recorded an increase to shareholders equity in of million and a reduction to shareholders equity of million in given the impact that the discount rate 
table of contents and stock market performance have on the projected benefit obligation and market value of plan assets  future changes in either one of these may significantly reduce or increase the amount of our pension plan under funding 
however  we do not believe the under funded status of the pension plan will materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in july  we renewed our million revolving credit facility with bank of america  n 
a 
indebtedness under the facility is unsecured and subject to traditional covenants relating to financial ratios and restrictions on certain types of transactions 
borrowings under this credit facility are available to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   there was no amount outstanding under this credit facility 
however  the aggregate amount we are able to borrow has been reduced by million due to outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility 
this credit facility is currently scheduled to expire in june  at which time any outstanding balance would be due 
in april  we made an investment in spotlight health  inc we entered into an agreement with spotlight health and bank of america  na to guarantee a million revolving line of credit provided to spotlight health by bank of america 
indebtedness under the line of credit is unsecured and subject to traditional covenants relating to financial ratios 
this credit facility is scheduled to expire on june   at which time any outstanding balance would be due 
as of december   spotlight health had million outstanding under this credit facility 
in accordance with the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 we have recorded a liability in the amount of million for the estimated fair value of the obligation we have assumed under this guarantee 
we review the financial statements of spotlight health on a quarterly basis to determine if it has sufficient financial resources to continue operations 
future events and circumstances might adversely affect spotlight health s financial condition and spotlight health might not be in the position to repay the facility  in which case bank of america may attempt to collect against us on our guarantee 
in september  we entered into agreements with surromed pursuant to which we committed to pay for biomarker discovery services from surromed in the amounts of million  million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  and to serve as a non exclusive representative to market and sell additional surromed biomarker discovery services 
in february  we acquired substantially all of surromed s assets related to its biomarker business and terminated these agreements and the associated purchase commitments 
in november  we entered into a collaboration agreement with syrrx to jointly develop and commercialize syrrx designed human dipeptidyl peptidase iv  or dpp iv  inhibitors as drug products for the treatment of type diabetes and other major human diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  we are obligated to provide preclinical and clinical development resources and expertise for the collaboration  and to fund the majority of preclinical and clinical studies through phase iib development of selected dpp iv inhibitors 
ppd and syrrx have agreed to share equally the costs of phase iii development 
in addition  we agreed to make milestone payments up to an aggregate amount equal to million to syrrx for each collaboration product upon the occurrence of certain clinical and regulatory events 
in september  we filed an investigational new drug application for one syrrx dpp iv inhibitor and the phase i clinical study for that inhibitor commenced in late october in the fourth quarter of  we paid syrrx a milestone payment of million as a result of the commencement of the phase i studies 
the remaining milestone payments will be expensed when the event triggering payment of the milestone occurs 
in the event we are successful in obtaining approval to market a drug product under the collaboration with syrrx  syrrx and ppd will share equally the profits from drug sales 
in february  takeda pharmaceutical company limited announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire of the equity of syrrx  inc we own million in preferred stock of syrrx 
if takeda completes the acquisition of syrrx  based on the terms of the merger agreement  we do not anticipate realizing a loss on this investment 
at this time  we do not know what impact  if any  this acquisition will have on our dpp iv collaboration with syrrx 
in april  we made an equity investment in chemokine therapeutics corp 
in connection with this investment  chemokine granted us an exclusive option to license a proprietary peptide for a one time license fee of million 
if we choose to exercise this option  we will be obligated to pay the one time license fee plus the costs for future development work on the peptide 
chemokine also granted us the right to first negotiate a license to other peptides 
chemokine completed an initial public offering of its common stock in canada in december 
table of contents in november  we became a limited partner in a 
m 
pappas life science ventures iii  lp  a venture capital fund 
the pappas fund was established for the purpose of making investments in equity securities of privately held companies in the life sciences  healthcare and technology industries 
under the terms of our agreements with the pappas fund  we committed to invest up to an aggregate of approximately million in the pappas fund 
no capital call can exceed of our aggregate capital commitment  and no more than two thirds of our commitment could be called prior to may as such  we anticipate that our aggregate investment will be made through a series of future capital calls over the next several years 
the first capital call was made in january at which time we invested  the second capital call is due in march  at which time we will invest an additional  our capital commitment will expire in may in january  we acquired approximately acres of property located in downtown wilmington  north carolina  on which we plan to construct a new headquarters building 
the new facility will be approximately  square feet and is expected to be completed in november at that time  we will begin consolidating our wilmington operations into the new building 
the total cost for the construction and up fit of the new building is expected to be in the range of million to million 
the total purchase price for the land was approximately million 
in connection with the sale of the property  the seller  almont shipping company  refinanced existing liens on the property with the proceeds of an million loan from bank of america  na this loan will mature in january and is secured by a lien on substantially all of almont s assets  including a tract of land containing approximately acres adjacent to the acre tract we acquired 
this loan is also secured by a guarantee from us 
almont s obligation to reimburse us in the event we are required to pay any sums to bank of america under the guarantee is also secured by a lien on substantially all of almont s assets 
as a part of this transaction  almont granted us an option to purchase all or a portion of the adjacent acre tract of land at an agreed upon price per acre 
the option will expire on january  in february  we acquired a dassault falcon ex aircraft for million 
we intend to use the aircraft for corporate purposes 
we financed the acquisition from available cash 
in january  we purchased million shares of accentia biopharmaceuticals  inc series e convertible preferred stock for million 
we also received a class a and class b warrant  each to purchase up to an additional million shares of series e convertible preferred stock for per share 
in january  we exercised the class a warrant for the purchase of an additional million shares of series e convertible preferred stock for million 
the class b warrant will expire on the earlier of january  or the effective date of a registration statement for the public sale of accentia common stock in a qualifying initial public offering 
in february  accentia filed a registration statement with the sec for its proposed initial public offering of its common stock 
accentia proposes to sell in this public offering  in addition to shares for its own account  up to million of common stock issuable to us upon conversion of million shares of the series e convertible preferred stock held by us 
the american jobs creation act of introduced a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer 
we have not previously recorded a us tax liability on such revenues since we intended to permanently reinvest them in our foreign operations 
no provision is being made in relating to this matter because we are currently evaluating the effect of the new act on our plan for these previously undistributed foreign earnings 
we expect to complete this evaluation by the end of june the income tax effect of repatriating these earnings is not estimable at this time 
under most of our agreements for development group services  we agree to indemnify and defend the sponsor against third party claims based on our negligence or willful misconduct 
any successful claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
we expect to continue expanding our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and investments 
we expect these activities will be funded from existing cash  cash flow from operations and  if necessary or appropriate  borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities 
we believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months 
from time to time  we evaluate potential acquisitions  investments and other growth opportunities that might require additional external financing  and we 
table of contents might seek funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
while we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next months  our sources of liquidity could be affected by our dependence on a small number of industries and clients  compliance with regulations  international risks  personal injury  environmental or intellectual property claims  as well as other factors described under item business factors that might affect our business or stock price  in this item under the subheadings potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price and critical accounting policies and estimates  and under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contractual obligations as of december   future minimum payments for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to december  are as follows in thousands and thereafter total long term debt  including interest payments services purchase commitments operating leases less sublease income total in february  we acquired substantially all of surromed s assets related to its biomarker business

as noted above  we became a limited partner in a venture capital fund in november under the terms of our agreements with that fund  we committed to invest up to an aggregate of approximately million in the fund 
ppd anticipates that its aggregate investment will be made through a series of future capital calls over the next several years 
also  in november  we entered into a collaboration agreement with syrrx 
under the terms of the agreement  we are obligated to fund the majority of preclinical and clinical development costs through phase iib development of each collaboration and will share phase iii costs equally with syrrx 
in addition  in connection with our investment in chemokine  chemokine granted us an exclusive option to license a proprietary peptide for million 
if we choose to exercise this option  we will be obligated to pay the costs for future development work on the peptide 
we also have a long term liability on our balance sheet regarding the underfunding of our uk pension plan for million 
we do not know when or if this will be funded since this liability will change based on the performance of the investments of the plan and changes in the benefit obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have guaranteed a million line of credit from bank of america to spotlight health

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the finance and audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are recorded from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance basis 
to measure performance on a given date  we compare direct costs incurred through that date to estimated total contract direct costs 
we believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contractual obligations because the costs relate primarily to the amount of labor incurred to perform the service 
direct costs are primarily comprised of labor and overhead related to the delivery of services 
each month we accumulate costs on each project and compare them to the total current estimated costs to determine the percentage of completion 
we then multiply this percentage by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue that can be recognized 
each month we review the total current estimated costs on each project to determine if these estimates are still accurate and  if necessary  we adjust the total estimated costs for each project 
as the work progresses  we might decide original estimates were incorrect due to  among other things  revisions in the scope of work or patient enrollment rate  and a contract modification might be negotiated with the customer to cover additional costs 
if a contract modification is not agreed to  we could bear the risk of cost overruns 
in the past  we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects  resulting in lower gross margins on those projects 
we might experience similar situations in the future 
changes to the estimated total contract direct costs result in a cumulative adjustment to the amount of revenue recognized in the period the change in estimate is determined 
should our estimated costs on fixed price contracts prove to be low  future margins could be reduced  absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification 
we accumulate information on each project to refine our bidding process 
historically  the majority of our estimates and assumptions have been materially correct  but these estimates might not continue to be accurate in the future 
a hypothetical increase to total estimated remaining project cost by for open projects accounted for under the proportional performance method as of december  would have resulted in a cumulative reduction in revenue of approximately million 
in our discovery science group  we generate revenue from time to time in the form of milestone payments 
milestone payments are only recognized as revenues if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer  payment is received and continued performance of future research and development services related to that milestone are not required 
future potential milestone payments under various discovery contracts might never be received if the milestones are not achieved 
allowance for doubtful accounts included in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net on our consolidated balance sheets is an allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  before we do business with a new client  we perform a credit check 
we also review our accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes the specific uncollectible accounts and an estimate of losses based on historical loss experience 
after all attempts to collect the receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
based on the information available to us  we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was adequate to cover uncollectible balances 
however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded reserve 
cost basis investments most of our cost basis investments consist of equity investments in private entities for which fair values are not readily determinable 
therefore  we record these investments under the cost method of accounting 
many of our investments are in relatively early stage life sciences or biotechnology companies that do not have established products or proven technologies and some do not have material revenue  if any 
therefore  these investments might be worth less than we paid for them  and they are subject to write down for impairment 
we assess our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for impairment  however for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
this quarterly review includes an evaluation of  among other things  the market condition of the overall industry  historical and projected financial performance  expected cash needs and recent funding events 
given the nature of these companies  our assessments of value are highly subjective 

table of contents tax valuation allowance estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from net operating losses  tax carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized  including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 
based on estimates of future taxable profits and losses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions  we determined that a valuation allowance of million was required for specific foreign tax loss carryforwards as of december  if these estimates prove inaccurate  a change in the valuation allowance  up or down  could be required in the future 
we also recorded a total valuation allowance of million related to the impairment of certain equity investments 
the valuation was determined based on the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate sufficient capital gains to utilize both realized and unrealized capital losses during the loss carryforward period 
a change in any of the investees financial health and or stock price  or a change in our ability to utilize a potential capital loss  could require a change of valuation allowance in the future 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  we would evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows and fair values are based on judgments and assumptions 
additionally  we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the underlying reporting units goodwill to their estimated fair value 
these tests for impairment of goodwill involve the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the reporting unit with which the goodwill is associated  and are inherently subjective 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
revised statement no 
requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of this statement 
in december  the fasb issued revised fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this revised interpretation is effective for all entities as of the first reporting period that ends after march  we have no investment in or contractual or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and  therefore  the adoption of this interpretation did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in november  during discussions on emerging issues task force  or eitf   the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  the eitf reached a consensus that requires quantitative and qualitative disclosures for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
and sfas no 
that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
in september  fasb staff position eitf was issued to delay the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance 
this delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of eitf such adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the eitf finalized its consensuses on eitf  accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination 
the consensuses in eitf provide guidance on how to account for the settlement of a preexisting relationship and how it affects the accounting of the business combination 
eitf is effective for business combinations consummated and goodwill impairment tests performed in reporting periods beginning after october  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment that will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value on the date of grant of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
revised is effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 

sfas no 
replaces the exception from fair value measurement included in apb opinion no 
for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement will be applied prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
taxes because we conduct operations on a global basis  our effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
our profits are also impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various taxing jurisdictions 
in particular  as the geographic mix of our pre tax earnings among various tax jurisdictions changes  our effective tax rate might vary from period to period 
inflation our long term contracts  those in excess of one year  generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date 
as a result  we expect that inflation generally will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
potential liability and insurance drug development services involve the testing of new drugs on human volunteers pursuant to a study protocol 
this testing exposes us to the risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients resulting from  among other things  possible unforeseen adverse side effects or improper administration of the new drug 
many of these patients are already seriously ill and are at risk of further illness or death 
we attempt to manage our risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients from administration of products under study through measures such as stringent operating procedures  contractual indemnification provisions with clients and insurance 
we monitor clinical trials in compliance with government regulations and guidelines 
we have adopted global standard operating 
table of contents procedures intended to satisfy regulatory requirements in the united states and in many foreign countries and to serve as a tool for controlling and enhancing the quality of drug development services 
the contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against our own actions  such as gross negligence 
we currently maintain professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe are adequate and appropriate 
potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
factors that could cause these fluctuations to occur include the timing of our discovery sciences group milestone payments or other revenue  the timing and amount of costs associated with r d and compound collaborations  exchange rate fluctuations between periods  our dependence on a small number of industries and clients  the timing of the initiation  progress or cancellation of significant projects  the timing and level of new business authorizations  the mix of products and services sold in a particular period  pricing pressure in the market for our services  our ability to recruit and retain experienced personnel  rapid technological change  the timing and amount of start up costs incurred in connection with the introduction of new products and services  the timing and extent of new government regulations  intellectual property risks  impairment of investments or intangible assets  the timing of the opening of new offices  the timing of other internal expansion costs  and the timing and amount of costs associated with integrating acquisitions 
delays and terminations of trials are often the result of actions taken by our customers or regulatory authorities  and are not typically controllable by us 
because a large percentage of our operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  variations in the timing and progress of large contracts can materially affect our quarterly operating results 
we believe that comparisons of our quarterly financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
fluctuations in quarterly results or other factors beyond our control could affect the market price of our common stock 
these factors include changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in our industry  announcements by competitors  changes in pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries  general economic conditions  and differences in assumptions used as compared to actual results 
any effect on our common stock could be unrelated to our longer term operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk by virtue of our international operations 
approximately  and of our net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from operations outside the united states 
funds generated by each subsidiary are generally reinvested in the country where they are earned 
our operations in the united kingdom generated more than of our net revenue from international operations during accordingly  we are exposed to adverse movements in the pound sterling and other foreign currencies 
the vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our united states or united kingdom subsidiaries 
the contracts entered into by the united states subsidiaries are almost always denominated in us dollars 
contracts entered into by our united kingdom subsidiaries are generally denominated in pounds sterling  us 
table of contents dollars or euros  but the majority of these contracts are in us dollars 
as a result of the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro and pound sterling during  in january we began engaging in hedging activities in an effort to manage our potential foreign exchange exposure 
we do have some currency risk resulting from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against those invoices 
if a contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  we recognize a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in our receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
we recognize this difference as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and report it in other income  net 
if exchange rates were to increase or decrease by in the future  we do not expect this would have a material effect on our financial statements 
our strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily on conducting our operations in a country s currency  intercompany foreign currency denominated loans and may  from time to time  involve use of currency derivatives  primarily forward exchange contracts  to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations 
as of december   we had open foreign exchange derivative contracts with a face amount totaling million to buy the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries 
the estimated fair value of the foreign currency derivative portfolio was million recorded as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets and  recorded as a component of other accrued expenses 
the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to the pound sterling and euro of would have been approximately million for the year ended december  based on revenues and the costs related to the united kingdom 
because our foreign currency hedging activities would partially offset these potential losses  we do not expect that a change in exchange rates in the future would have a material effect on our financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of foreign subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
the process by which we translate each foreign subsidiary s financial results to us dollars is as follows we translate income statement accounts at average exchange rates for the period  we translate balance sheet assets and liability accounts at end of period exchange rates  and we translate equity accounts at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects shareholders equity through the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet  stated in us dollars  in balance 
translation adjustments are reported with accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
to date  cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to our consolidated financial position 
however  future translation adjustments could materially and adversely affect our financial position 
currently  there are no material exchange controls on the payment of dividends or otherwise prohibiting the transfer of funds out of or from within any country in which we conduct operations 
although we perform services for clients located in a number of foreign jurisdictions  we have not experienced any difficulties in receiving funds remitted from foreign countries 
however  new or modified exchange control restrictions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash equivalents and amounts outstanding under notes payable and lines of credit 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with interest rates based on financial market conditions 
we do not expect that a change in interest rates in the future would have a material effect on our financial statements
