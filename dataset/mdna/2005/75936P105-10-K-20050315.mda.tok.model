overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
selected significant accounting policies management has selected the following accounting policies which it believes are significant in order to understand the company s activities  financial position and operating results 
principles of consolidation and financial statement presentation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities contributed to and assumed by the company from the trust  from the time such assets and liabilities were acquired or incurred  respectively  by the trust 
such financial statements have been prepared using the historical basis of the assets and liabilities and the historical results of operations related to the company s assets and liabilities 
investments in entities where the company does not have a controlling interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for the company s proportionate share of the investment s income loss  additional contributions or distributions 
investments in entities where the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions among the company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company evaluates its investments and subsidiaries to determine if an entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie under the provisions of finr 
an entity is a vie when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity from financing its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii equity holders either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity or investment is deemed to be a vie  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the vie or receives a majority of the residual returns is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
the following table and footnotes identify the company s vies vie at december  requires entity a consolidation wrp convertible trust i yes no no b non qualified deferred compensation trust yes yes yes c reis yes yes no d second holding e yes no f wellsford mantua yes yes yes g claverack yes n a yes h beekman yes n a no i a for additional information regarding these entities  see footnotes  and b the entity that issued the convertible trust preferred securities is a vie  however it is not appropriate to consolidate this entity under the provisions of finr as equity interests are variable interests only to the extent that the investment is considered to be at risk 
since the company s investment was funded by wrp convertible trust i  it is not considered to be at risk 
accordingly  the company de consolidated the entity during the first quarter of c the non qualified deferred compensation trust rabbi trust is a vie as it does not have its own equity 
the company is the primary beneficiary loss absorber of the rabbi trust as the assets would be subject to attachment in a bankruptcy 
the company consolidated the assets and liabilities of the rabbi trust at december  and  as well as for periods prior to the issuance of finr as appropriate under other existing accounting literature 
d reis is a vie because as of the last capital event for that entity in  it was determined that reis did not have sufficient capital to support its business activities 
consolidation of reis is not required by the company as it would not be the primary beneficiary 
e the company sold its investment in second holding in november f second holding was a vie at december   however  the company is not the primary beneficiary because it is not expected that it will absorb a majority of second holding s probability weighted expected losses  nor would it ever receive a majority of the residual returns 
therefore  consolidation was not required under finr nor was consolidation appropriate under existing accounting literature 
the company used the equity method of accounting to account for this investment 
g wellsford mantua is a vie as the venture does not have sufficient equity to support its operations as the company provides of the financing to this entity and the owners have deminimus equity in the entity 
the company is the primary beneficiary and consolidates this entity 
h claverack  an entity in which the company has a interest in equity and profits except if returns exceed as defined is considered a vie  since the original capital is insufficient to support its contemplated activities 
claverack is consolidated  even though the two members share business decisions equally  since the company would be the primary beneficiary of profits or absorber of losses 
at december   claverack had  of restricted cash and  of construction in process and was subject to  of mortgage debt which was non recourse to the company 
i beekman is a vie  however  since the company s investment is a mortgage interest  the company has no gaap equity in the entity and would not be the primary absorber of losses  consolidation is not appropriate 
real estate  other investments  depreciation  amortization and impairment 
costs directly related to the acquisition  development and improvement of real estate are capitalized  including interest and other costs incurred during the construction period

the company expenses all lease turnover costs for its residential units such as painting  cleaning  carpet replacement and other turnover costs as such costs are incurred 
depreciation is computed over the expected useful lives of depreciable property on a straight line basis  principally years for residential buildings and improvements and two to twelve years for furnishings and equipment 
the company reviews its real estate assets  investments in joint ventures and other investments for impairment i whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable for assets held for use and ii when a determination is made to sell an asset or investment

the company accounts for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances with respect to deferred income tax assets are recorded when deemed appropriate and adjusted based upon periodic evaluations

the loss in the period is primarily attributable to i a  impairment charge recorded by the company at september  related to the sale of its interest in second holding  ii the company s net  share of a write down of one of second holding s investments during the first quarter of and iii the company s share of losses aggregating  from wellsford whitehall including a loss from operations  a loss of  recorded in the third quarter of relating to the redemption transaction and impairment provisions relating to assets held for sale at december  aggregating  offset by the gain from a single asset sale in march of  the loss is primarily attributable to an impairment provision by the wellsford whitehall venture and related charges during the fourth quarter of annually  after the preparation of budgets for the following year and as part of the financial statement closing process  wellsford whitehall performs evaluations for impairment on all of its real estate assets 
as part of the fiscal evaluation  wellsford whitehall recorded an impairment charge of approximately  related to assets in the portfolio during the fourth quarter of the provision was not the result of a change in the intended use of such assets 
however  it was the result of several factors including  but not limited to  a continued deterioration of and outlook for the suburban office submarkets where wellsford whitehall s properties are situated 
specifically  these included decreasing market rents  slower absorption trends and greater tenant concession costs 
the company s share of this impairment charge was approximately  in additionally  as a result of the wellsford whitehall charge  the company wrote off the balance of unamortized warrant costs of  related to wellsford whitehall and determined at that time that it was not appropriate to carry the balance of the net deferred tax asset attributable to nol carryforwards and recorded a valuation allowance of  in the fourth quarter of rental revenue decreased  this decrease is due to the impact of rent concessions in excess of the period at all phases of palomino park  and the gradual elimination of rental operations at the silver mesa phase resulting from unit sales and all units being classified as sales inventory by december   whereas more units were being rented during the period as compared to the period  offset by increased average physical occupancy of for from for at the blue ridge  red canyon and green river phases at palomino park revenues from sales of residential units and the associated cost of sales from such units were  and  respectively  from silver mesa unit sales during and were  and  respectively  from sales during the corresponding period 
the average pre tax income from unit sales was approximately  greater per unit than in the corresponding period as a result of a reduced commission rate on the units sold  revised downward estimates of total project costs in and no interest costs included in cost of sales in as the outstanding debt balance was repaid in may interest revenue decreased  this decrease is due to reduced interest of  on loans from lower average outstanding loan balances in the period as compared to the period including  related to the loss of revenue during the period and the receipt of a  yield maintenance penalty from the park loan prepayment in september and  of non recurring income earned in in excess of amounts  offset by increased interest earned on cash and us government securities of  from a higher average outstanding investable cash and securities balance during the current period versus the comparable period 
fee revenue decreased  asset disposition fees payable by whitehall derived from wellsford whitehall sales amounted to  during  as compared to fees of  earned in the period 
the company s management fees for its role in the second holding investment decreased  for the period from the period 
fee revenue during the current period was impacted by changes in the amount of assets under management by second holding as a result of the decision not to purchase any new assets and allow the run off of existing investments and by the sale of the company s interest in the venture in november property operating and maintenance expense decreased  this decrease is primarily the result of a decline in operating expenses for the silver mesa phase from continuing unit sales during and of  see sales discussion above  offset by the effect of net increases for property operating and maintenance expenses at the other phases of palomino park of  including increases in replacements  advertising  payroll and utility costs  offset by decreases in certain maintenance cost categories and period costs in for the consolidated development projects of the decrease in real estate taxes of  is primarily attributable to reduced taxes from fewer silver mesa units from continuing sales  and reduced taxes on the gold peak land from a lower assessment and the commencement in september of capitalizing taxes to the project basis during development 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  this decrease is primarily attributable to the company expensing  of unamortized warrant costs in  including the remaining unamortized balance of  which was written off at december  in connection with the impairment charge recorded by wellsford whitehall with no comparable expense in the period 
the decrease is additionally impacted by no depreciation expense recorded on the silver mesa units as all of the units were transferred from operations to residential units available for sale during  offset by additional amortization related to the clairborne fordham venture recorded during  and the write off of unamortized second holding basis differences of  upon the sale of the company s investment in november aggregate interest expense increased  this increase is attributable to interest expense and deferred cost amortization on  of debentures during the period of  as a result of the adoption of finr and the de consolidation of the convertible trust preferred securities  as previously described  whereas such expense was treated as a distribution in the period 
the increase is also attributable to the green river phase as the period includes interest for the entire period at a higher fixed rate on a larger average outstanding balance on the permanent financing  whereas during the period  there was a lower variable interest rate on a lower amount of construction financing until the permanent financing was in place in february 
in addition  the period had a higher average base interest rate on the palomino park bonds as compared to the period  due to rising interest rates during these increases were offset by lower average outstanding principal balances with respect to the other palomino park phases loans  and capitalized interest of  in with only  capitalized in the period

b amounts reflect the net gains from the disposition of eight properties in and eleven properties in c impairment provisions recorded at december  relate primarily to classifying assets as held for sale and writing down the assets to expected selling prices  less closing costs 
the impairment primarily related to significant declines in the economics of the properties as previously described herein 
d the loss for is the result of i a  net impairment charge taken by second holding of which the company s share was  related to the write down of one of its investments during the first quarter of  offset by a partial recovery when the investment was sold in the second quarter of and ii a  impairment charge recorded by the company at september  related to the ultimate sale of its interest in the venture in november minority interest changed  to a benefit of  in the period from a benefit of  in the period  primarily attributable to the formation of two development entities with minority partners who share in each respective development project s current period losses  and a minority interest benefit related to the consolidation of an entity in accordance with the provisions of finr  offset by a reduction in the minority interest benefit for palomino park

if the fee had remained at for the comparable period  the decrease would have been  less

inflation declining prices substantially all of wellsford whitehall s leases with their tenants provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the cpi or other measures 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset by the expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 
a majority of the leases at palomino park are for a term of one year or less which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal or re letting of apartment units during an inflationary period 
such short term leases generally minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
conversely  in a period of declining economics  short term leases pose an increasing risk to the company of reduced rental revenue and decreased cash flow from lower rents in conjunction with concessions to new and renewal tenants 
palomino park s operating phases continue to offer significant concessions approximately three months free rent on a twelve month lease 
assets in the wellsford whitehall portfolio are subject to similar risks regarding declining economics which may result in reduced rental revenue and decreased cash flow from lower rents and greater concessions to new and renewal tenants 
all of the residential developments that the company has an interest in are exposed to inflation for the cost of building materials  such as wood  cement and sheetrock 
significant increases in these costs may negatively affect the profitability and cash flows of each project 
trends the markets in which the company owns and operates its assets or has investments in entities which own and operate assets are subjected to general and local economic business conditions 
based upon the current economic environment  these conditions may negatively impact the occupancy levels  rents and the amount of concessions at the operating phases of palomino park and the sale of residential units at each of the company s for sale housing projects  all of which are included in the residential activities sbu and the sale of the remaining fordham tower residential units in the debt and equity activities sbu 
wellsford whitehall  in the commercial property activities sbu  would be similarly impacted by such economic conditions in connection with leasing properties and the ability to sell properties in the portfolio 
rising insurance premium costs or availability of certain insurance coverages may negatively impact the operating results and cash flows of the company s assets and sbus 
energy costs may continue to increase as a result of world and domestic events  also negatively impacting operating results and cash flows 
the availability and cost of other natural resources  such as restrictions on the use of water from time to time in the denver market  could negatively impact operating results and cash flows as well 
the number and timing of future sales of any residential units by the company or by its joint ventures could be adversely impacted by increases in interest rates and the availability of credit to potential buyers in  whereas during and  historically low interest rates may have benefited sales results
