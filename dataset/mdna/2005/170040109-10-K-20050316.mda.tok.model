see note  segment information  of notes to consolidated financial statements for geographic information and operating results by operating segment 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a global biopharmaceutical company  the revenues of which primarily consist of product sales  revenues from a joint business contractual arrangement  collaborative agreement revenues  royalty and license fee revenues and other revenues  which primarily consist of contract manufacturing and grant revenues 
our research and development efforts are focused on developing products for oncology and infectious and pulmonary disease 
we participate in three healthcare markets blood testing  vaccines and biopharmaceuticals 
the blood testing segment consists of an alliance with gen probe and our one half share in the pretax operating earnings generated by the joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics 
our alliance with gen probe is focused on developing and commercializing nucleic acid testing products using transcription mediated amplification technology to screen donated blood and plasma products for viral infection 
our joint business arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics is operated under a contractual arrangement and is not a separate and distinct legal entity 
through our joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics  we sell a line of immunodiagnostic tests to detect hepatitis viruses and retroviruses and provide supplemental tests and microplate and chemiluminescent instrument systems to automate test performance and data collection 
the blood testing segment also earns royalties from third parties based on their sales of immunodiagnostic and nucleic acid testing probe diagnostic products utilizing our hepatitis c virus and hiv related patents  for use in blood screening and plasma fractionation markets 
the vaccines segment consists of more than pediatric and adult vaccines including influenza  meningococcal  travel  and pediatric vaccines 
we sell these vaccines primarily in the us  germany  italy and the united kingdom  as well as in other international markets 
our vaccines segment is also involved in the development of other novel vaccines and vaccination technology 
we acquired fluvirin influenza virus vaccine  arilvax vaccine for yellow fever and dukoral vaccine for cholera as part of our july  acquisition of powderject 
we accounted for that acquisition as a business combination and included powderject s operating results in our consolidated operating results beginning july  the biopharmaceuticals segment consists of therapeutic products  with an emphasis on the treatment of cancer  infectious and pulmonary diseases 
our in house capabilities span three types of therapeutics  including small molecules  therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies 
our products include tobi tobramycin solution for inhalation for pseudomonal lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients  proleukin aldesleukin for cancer metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma  and betaseron interferon beta b for multiple sclerosis 
the biopharmaceuticals segment also includes collaborations with berlex laboratories  inc and its parent company  schering ag of germany  related to betaseron interferon beta b 
the biopharmaceuticals segment earns royalties on third party sales of several products  primarily betaferon interferon beta b  and earns license fees for technologies  such as hepatitis c virus related patents  used by third parties to develop therapeutic products 
we view certain other revenues and expenses as not belonging to any one segment 
as a result  we have aggregated these items into an other segment 
fluvirin influenza virus vaccine recent events during the third quarter of  in conducting final internal release procedures for our fluvirin influenza virus vaccine  our quality systems identified lots that did not meet product sterility specifications 
as a result  we determined at that time to delay releasing any fluvirin vaccine doses pending completion of internal investigations 
on october   the uk regulatory body  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  or mhra  sent us a letter prohibiting us from releasing any fluvirin vaccine doses manufactured at our liverpool facility since march  and suspending our license to manufacture influenza virus vaccine in our liverpool facility for three months later extended for an additional three months 
in that letter  the mhra asserted that our manufacturing process did not comply with uk good manufacturing practices regulations 
following the mhra s decision and an inspection by the food and drug administration  or fda  the fda sent us a warning letter citing violations of good manufacturing practices 
we provided the fda with a written response to the warning letter on january  as a result of the suspension of our license  we did not release any fluvirin product during the influenza season 
on march   the mhra notified us that it had lifted the license suspension  giving chiron clearance to initiate full production of fluvirin vaccine  conditioned on the understanding that chiron s commitment to its remediation plan will continue 
the fda is still expected to conduct a full inspection to determine whether deficiencies noted in the warning letter the fda issued in december have been resolved 
if we fail to adequately address the matters discussed in the warning letter  the fda may modify our us license in an adverse manner  take action that could result in imposition of fines  require temporary or permanent cessation of future selling of fluvirin vaccine or take other action that could reduce our ability to market fluvirin vaccine 
we received a grand jury subpoena issued by the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york in october requesting production of certain documents relating to fluvirin vaccine and the suspension by the mhra of our license 
in february  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  notified us that it would commence a formal investigation into whether we or our employees have violated any federal securities laws in connection with these developments regarding fluvirin vaccine  after having previously commenced an informal inquiry 
we also received a voluntary request for information from the united states house of representatives committee on energy and commerce requesting production of certain documents 
numerous documents have been collected and produced in response to these requests  and several witnesses have been interviewed by the us attorney s office and the sec staff and additional interviews are anticipated 
additional investigations regarding these matters may arise 
in addition  we and certain of our officers and directors have also been named as defendants in several putative shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits alleging various claims arising out of or relating to these developments regarding fluvirin vaccine  including the us centers for disease control and prevention and certain distributors of fluvirin vaccine who have suggested that they are entitled to compensation under their contracts for the season 
it is not possible to predict whether any of these claims will be pursued and  if so  whether those claims will be upheld 
investigations  litigation and disputes have caused us to incur substantial expense and have required significant time and attention from our management and will continue to do so in the future and could result in civil and or criminal penalties against chiron 
the results of any such investigations  proceedings or disputes could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
for more information on these lawsuits  investigations and claims  see part i  item legal proceedings above 
as a result of these fluvirin vaccine matters  our results of operations for were materially adversely affected 
these developments had the following immediate impact on our results of operations for the twelve months ended december  we had no sales of fluvirin vaccine for the season  while fluvirin vaccine sales were million for the twelve months ended december   and we wrote off our entire inventory of fluvirin vaccine  resulting in a million charge to cost of sales  incurred remediation costs associated with our liverpool facility of million  and incurred legal expenses of million related to the developments with respect to fluvirin vaccine 
these charges decreased diluted earnings per share by approximately for the twelve months ended december  our inability to supply fluvirin vaccine during the influenza season may also lead to loss of market share in the season and future seasons 
following the announcement of our license suspension  competitors have announced plans to introduce influenza vaccine products in the united states and are seeking expedited regulatory approval to do so 
even though the license suspension has been lifted  some of our customers may choose to purchase flu vaccine from other providers as their products become available in the united states 
loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we also expect to incur expenses in connection with ongoing fluvirin vaccine matters  which could be material  including in connection with our continuing remediation efforts at our liverpool facility  and responding to the us attorney for the southern district of new york  the sec  the united states house of representatives committee on energy and commerce and the private lawsuits and other claims and investigations that may arise 
for additional information concerning the risks we face as a result of these fluvirin vaccine developments  see factors that may affect future results the recent developments with respect to fluvirin vaccine will harm our business and results of operations 
for additional information on the us attorney s investigation  sec investigation and private lawsuits and other claims  see part i  item legal proceedings of this report on form k 
restated second quarter and third quarter financial statements during our year end financial statement review and section sarbanes oxley review  we determined that certain sales of the travel vaccine recorded as revenues in the second quarter of should not have been recorded as revenue at that time  and that portions of those sales should have been recorded as revenues in the third and fourth quarters of and possibly in later quarters 
as a result  we determined to restate the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on q for such quarters 
summary restated income statement information for the second and third quarters of is included in note  quarterly financial data unaudited  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in light of the fact that we were already in contact with the sec in relation to their investigation described above under fluvirin influenza virus vaccine recent events  we informed the sec of these matters  and adjustments we made after january  to the fourth quarter and full year financial information we released on january   and have been providing the sec information 
summary consolidated financial data following is an analysis and discussion of our operating results on a consolidated basis  which is followed by a description of our most critical accounting policies and use of estimates and more detailed analysis and discussion of our operating results by segment and our liquidity and capital resources

sales of fluvirin influenza vaccine were million for the twelve months ended december  a contractual decline in the betaseron interferon beta b royalty rate  described in more detail below  resulted in a million decline in total revenues for the twelve months ended december  our total revenues were affected by the movement in exchange rates  in particular the movements in the euro and british pound against the us dollar 
the movement in exchange rates added approximately to our total revenues for the twelve months ended december  as described above  we wrote off our entire fluvirin product inventory  resulting in a million charge to cost of sales  incurred remediation costs associated with our liverpool facility of million  and incurred legal expenses of million related to the fluvirin vaccine developments discussed above under fluvirin influenza virus vaccine recent events  which decreased diluted earnings per share by approximately for the twelve months ended december  also since our euro and british pound denominated expenses have increased due to the movement in exchange rates  our earnings per share from continuing operations declined per diluted share for the twelve months ended december   as our expenses denominated in euros and british pounds exceeded our revenues denominated in those currencies 
product sales decreased compared to as there were no fluvirin influenza vaccine sales for the season 
the decrease in fluvirin vaccine sales was partially offset by increased sales in procleix products  tobi tobramycin inhalation solution  other influenza vaccines products  proleukin aldesleukin and travel vaccines 
sales of procleix and tobi products increased and  respectively  in when compared to royalty and licenses fees increased significantly compared to due to the f 
hoffmann la roche roche settlement regarding our hiv patent in the us the settlement included a million lump sum payment  of which million was recognized in the third quarter in addition  the settlement resulted in million of previously deferred royalty and license payments  being was recognized in the third quarter the impact of these items from the roche settlement was an approximate increase in diluted earnings per share for royalties and license fees also increased million from a non exclusive license we granted to the german red cross and million from a licensing agreement with labcorp 
other revenues declined due to million of revenue in from the biogen and serono settlements in connection with certain patents owned by chiron and licensed exclusively to schering ag s us subsidiary  berlex laboratories 
in  gross profit margins decreased to from in  primarily due to the write off of our entire inventory of fluvirin vaccine  resulting in a million charge to cost of sales in the third quarter  as well as the fact that there were no fluvirin vaccine sales for the season 
in addition  remediation costs of million associated with our liverpool facility were included in cost of sales in the effect of the fluvirin vaccine charge and remediation costs resulted in a point decrease in our gross profit margin percentage for gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by reduced sales and margins of the menjugate product  which decreased our gross profit margin by percentage points when comparing with gross profit margins do not include amortization expense from acquired developed products  an intangible asset related to business combinations 
the main components of the increase in research and development expenses in as compared with include our infectious disease franchise  primarily tifacogin  our oncology franchise  our meningococcus vaccine franchise and our flu cell culture program 
these increases were partially offset by the discontinuance of development of tezacitabine and pa in addition  included expenses related to the in licensing of cubicin daptomycin for injection and technology from zymequest inc and infectio diagnostic inc the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in as compared with mainly reflects an million increase due to the movement in the euro and british pound exchange rates  million from a full year of powderject expenses and million in legal expenses related to the fluvirin developments discussed above under fluvirin influenza virus vaccine recent events 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to defense of our patents and technology  on going marketing and pre launch programs to support the continued growth of our business and investment in geographic penetration for our products and corporate governance costs 
the effective tax rate for was of pretax income from continuing operations  including the charge for purchased in process research and development related to the sagres acquisition 
the effective tax rate for was of pretax income from continuing operations including the charge for purchased in process research and development related to the powderject acquisition 
the charges for the purchased in process research and development in and are not tax deductible 
the effective tax rates in and were both of pretax income from continuing operations  after excluding the impact of the purchased in process research and development charges 
the effective tax rate in includes increased benefits from research tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower rates 
such benefits are a greater percentage of pretax income in than in these benefits were offset by the tax cost of transferring certain product rights through inter company transactions as part of our long term tax planning strategy 
the effective tax rate may be affected in future periods by changes in management s estimates with respect to our deferred tax assets and other items affecting the overall tax rate 
compared with total revenues for powderject in were million 
powderject flu vaccine sales were million in in  our total revenues reflected the benefit of the movement in exchange rates  in particular the movement in the euro to us dollar exchange rate 
in  the movement in exchange rates added approximately to our total revenues 
our vaccines segment reflects the greatest impact of the movement in exchange rates  which added approximately to our total vaccines revenues 
similarly  our total euro based expenses increased due to the movement in exchange rates 
in  increases in product sales were seen across all three of our business units  and in particular flu vaccines and procleix products 
our share of revenues from our joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics was million compared to million in  up primarily due to a one time benefit in the first quarter from a change in estimate relating to revenues from ortho clinical diagnostics non us affiliate sales  as discussed below 
royalty and license fees  collaborative agreement revenues and other revenues were million in compared to million in  up primarily due to hcv hiv product royalties and license fees from our intellectual property portfolio and betaferon royalties 
in  gross margins decreased to from in  largely due to i changes in the product mix of our three segments and ii additional costs of million in associated with the sale of inventory acquired during the acquisition of powderject 
these additional costs related to a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of powderject 
in particular  vaccine product sales accounted for of total product revenues in up from in  which had a significant impact on gross margins 
research and development expenses for powderject were million in the spending reflects our increased level of investment across all three of our segments 
the main beneficiaries of this increase include our meningococcal vaccines franchise  flu cell culture  tifacogin and interleukin in combination with various monoclonal antibodies 
in addition  there were additional expenses related to the in licensing of daptomycin from cubist pharmaceuticals and purchased in process technology associated with our investment in zymequest inc we are collaborating with zymequest  inc to develop and commercialize a enzymatic conversion system which converts group a  b and ab red blood cells to enzyme converted group o eco red blood cells  and costs associated with an agreement with infectio diagnostics inc in which we licensed proprietary nucleic acid based technology for the rapid detection of bacterial contamination in platelets and blood products 
however  we are no longer investing in the bacterial detection technology due to changes in the market 
in  selling general and administrative expenses totaled million compared to million in with powderject contributing approximately million in the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from additional costs associated with the enhancement of current business processes and headcount  the euro to us dollar exchange rate fluctuation  the expansion of our customer base for the procleix hiv hcv assay in the us  europe and other international markets  the preparation and roll out of the west nile virus assay under ind testing  ongoing sales and marketing programs to support tobi tobramycin in the us and continued market penetration in europe and continued investment in and defense of our patents and technology 
the reported effective tax rate for is of pretax income from continuing operations  including the charge for purchased in process research and development related to the powderject acquisition 
the reported effective tax rate for was of pretax income from continuing operations  including the charge for purchased in process research and development related to the matrix pharmaceutical acquisition 
the effective tax rates for and after excluding the impact of the in process research and development charges were and 
the effective tax rate is lower than the effective tax rate due to an increase in income earned in lower tax jurisdictions  net of increased benefits recognized in with respect to our research and development activities 
on february   we acquired matrix pharmaceutical  a company that was developing tezacitabine  a drug to treat cancer 
we accounted for the acquisition as an asset purchase and included matrix pharmaceutical s operating results in our consolidated operating results beginning on february  matrix pharmaceutical is part of our biopharmaceuticals segment 
we allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we allocated million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development  which we charged operations in critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  inventories  derivatives  capital leases  intangible assets  goodwill  purchased in process research and development  product discounts  rebates and returns  bad debts  collaborative  royalty and license arrangements  restructuring  pension and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our blood testing segment includes our one half share in the pretax operating earnings generated by the joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc our joint business arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics is a contractual arrangement and is not a separate and distinct legal entity 
through our joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics  we sell a line of immunodiagnostic tests to detect hepatitis viruses and retroviruses and provide supplemental tests and microplate and chemiluminescent instrument systems to automate test performance and data collection 
prior to  we accounted for revenues relating to non us affiliate sales on a one quarter lag  with an adjustment of the estimate to actual in the subsequent quarter 
more current information of non us affiliate sales of our joint business contractual arrangement became available in the first quarter  and as a result  we are able to recognize revenues relating to non us affiliate sales on a one month lag 
the effect of this change  net of tax  was an increase to net income by million for revenues from the joint business arrangement for the year ended december  for sales of betaseron interferon beta b  we recognize revenues upon shipment to our marketing partner  schering  and additional revenues upon schering s subsequent sale of betaseron interferon beta b to patients 
upon shipment to schering  we recognize the contractually determined fixed amount of the fee to which we are entitled because at this point  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price due from schering is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
upon receiving the contractual reporting of relevant customer sales from schering  we recognize the incremental portion of the fee related to schering s shipments to its customers because this portion of the fee is not determinable until receipt of the related sales reports 
we also earn royalties on our marketing partner s european sales of betaferon product in those cases where we do not supply the product 
prior to  we accounted for revenues from non us product sales on a one quarter lag and royalties as a percentage of forecast received from our marketing partner  with an adjustment of the estimate to actual in the subsequent quarter 
more current information of non us betaseron interferon beta b sales became available in  and as a result  we were able to recognize revenues from betaseron product sales and betaferon interferon beta b royalties on a current basis beginning in the first quarter the effect of this change  net of tax  was an increase in net income for the year ended december  by million for product sales and million for royalties 
we believe the following critical accounting policies incorporate our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements purchased in process research and development we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
to assist in determining the value of the in process research and development and certain other intangibles  a third party valuation is typically obtained as of the acquisition date if the acquisition is significant 
we generally use the income approach to value in process research and development 
the income approach is based on the premise that the value of a security or asset is the present value of the future earning capacity that is available for distribution to the subject investors in the security or asset 
we perform a discounted cash flow analysis  utilizing anticipated revenues  expenses and net cash flow forecasts related to the technology 
given the high risk associated with the development of new drugs  we probability adjust the revenue and expense forecasts to reflect the risk of advancement through the regulatory approval process based on the stage of development in the regulatory process 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe the fair value assigned to the in process research and development is based on reasonable assumptions 
however  these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
additionally  estimates for the purchase price allocation may change as subsequent information becomes available 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  upon completion of strategic assessments of the value of certain powderject research and development projects  we revised the allocation of a portion of the purchase price resulting in a million decrease to purchased in process research and development which we credited to operations and which was offset against goodwill 
investments we invest in marketable equity securities 
the prices of some of our marketable securities are subject to considerable volatility 
we record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in a marketable security has experienced a decline in fair value  as measured by quoted market prices  that is other than temporary 
generally  we believe that an investment in a marketable security is impaired if its quoted market price has been below its carrying value for each trading day in a six month period or a credit event has occurred  at which point we write down the investment 
however  in determining whether impairment of a marketable security is considered to be other than temporary  we consider all available factors in the evaluation 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  i whether the issuer of the securities is experiencing depressed and declining earnings in relation to competitors  erosion of market share  and deteriorating financial position  ii whether the issuer is experiencing financial difficulties and its market is experiencing difficulties  iii ongoing activity in our collaborations with the issuer  if any  and iv the issuer s prospects for favorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements 
decreases in the fair value of these securities may impact our profitability 
to reduce this risk  we hedge a portion of our equity securities exposure through forward sales contracts 
inventories we maintain inventory reserves primarily for product failures  expiration and obsolescence 
the manufacturing processes for many of our products are complex 
slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process may result in unacceptable changes in the products that may result in failures or recalls and  therefore  additional inventory reserves 
obsolete inventory  due to the expiration of shelf life  and the seasonal nature of some of our products  may result in additional inventory reserves 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze on a product by product basis i the shelf life and the expiration date  ii sales forecasts and iii inventory levels compared to forecasted usage 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales and usage information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to estimate an inventory obsolescence reserve 
in addition  we operate in a highly competitive environment  with rapidly changing technologies 
new technology or changes in production processes may result in product obsolescence 
as a result  we may be required to record additional inventory reserves 
product returns and rebates we have extensive historical information on returns and rebates for our products 
historical information with respect to actual product returns and rebates is the primary factor assessed in estimating product returns and rebates allowances 
in determining the allowance for product returns  we primarily use one of the following methodologies depending on the product i we match the actual returns to the actual sale on a product by product basis to assess the historical trend for returns  and based on an analysis of the historical trend  the appropriate return percentage for the current period is then applied to current period sales to arrive at the product returns charge against revenue for the period or ii for seasonal products we analyze our actual returns over the previous seasons to arrive at the average actual returns percentage  which is then applied to the current season s sales to arrive at the charge against revenue for the current period 
in estimating rebates  we use historical trends to analyze rebates against revenue on a product by product basis to arrive at an expected rebate percentage 
this expected rebate percentage is applied to current period sales to arrive at the rebates expense for the period 
if actual product returns and rebates vary  we may need to adjust our estimates and accruals accordingly 
collaborative  royalty and license arrangements we recognize up front refundable fees as revenues upon the later of when they become nonrefundable or when performance obligations are completed 
in situations where continuing performance obligations exist  we defer and amortize up front nonrefundable fees ratably over the performance period  which is typically stipulated by the contract and we may also defer further until collection is reasonably assured 
in arrangements with multiple deliverables  there may be significant judgment in determining whether the different revenue generating activities are separable 
milestones  if any  related to scientific or technical achievements are recognized in income when the milestone is accomplished 
the terms of such arrangements may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
we estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received or on product sales forecast information provided by the third party licensee 
in the subsequent quarter  we record an adjustment equal to the difference between those estimated royalty revenues recorded in the previous quarter and the contractual percentage of the third party s actual product sales for that period 
we exercise judgment in determining whether the forecast information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
if we determined that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net deferred tax assets  adjustments to the deferred tax assets would increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that we made such determination 
likewise  if we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the deferred tax assets would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that we made such determination 
annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns  however  the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ materially from the amount accrued 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for probable exposures 
we maintain an allowance for tax contingencies  which management believes to be adequate 
as part of our long term tax planning strategy  we transfer certain product rights through inter company transactions 
tax expense and the effective tax rate increase in the years these transactions take place  with the expected future benefit being lower taxation of future product revenues 
litigation and other contingencies we establish and maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimable  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we base our accruals on information available internally within the company at the time of such determination and after management has consulted with and obtained advice from external professional advisors 
judgment is required in both the determination of probability and as to whether such an exposure is reasonably estimable 
information may become available to us after that time  for which adjustments to accruals may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
for the powderject acquisition  we initially allocated million of the purchase price to goodwill in the third quarter in the fourth quarter  the allocation of the purchase price changed as we completed the strategic assessments of the value of certain research and development projects and adjusted the purchased in process research and development  and upon finalization of certain estimates 
accordingly  goodwill associated with the powderject acquisition was adjusted to million in the fourth quarter during  we completed the planned divestiture of certain research operations in madison  wisconsin and oxford  england and certain vaccines operations in sweden  we adjusted the previously recorded obligation related to an assumed defined benefit plan  revised estimates of exit costs associated with certain contractual obligations under supply and research agreements related to the divested research operations and other direct acquisition costs  and revised estimates of certain receivables and insurance estimates 
the net impact of these items resulted in an increase to goodwill associated with the powderject acquisition of million and goodwill was adjusted from million in to million in once it is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include significant continued under performance compared to peers  significant changes in the underlying business and products of our reporting units  or other factors specific to each asset or reporting unit being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain minor arithmetical variances between the following narrative and the consolidated financial statements may arise due to rounding

in the case of equipment sales or leases  we record revenue upon the sale and transfer of the title to the instrument or ratably over the life of the lease term  respectively 
for the provision of service on the instruments  we recognize revenue ratably over the life of the service agreement 
the increase in product sales in as compared with was primarily due to i million for the introduction of the west nile virus assay on an investigational use basis in the us in march  which had a full year of sales in  ii million for the continued penetration into several markets abroad and iii million for market share gains in the us for the procleix hiv hcv assay 
the increase in product sales in as compared with primarily related to million from commercial pricing in the us commencing may  for the procleix hiv hcv assay following the us food and drug administration approval in february  while there was a full year of commercial pricing in in addition  after the first quarter  we signed new commercial contracts including those with existing america s blood centers customers  the american red cross  the us military and the association of independent blood centers to provide the procleix hiv hcv assay  which resulted in an increase in sales of million in as compared with other factors contributing to the increase in were i million from the introduction of the west nile virus assay on an investigational use basis in the us in march and ii million from increased sales to several markets abroad for the procleix hiv hcv assay 
slightly offsetting the increase in product sales related to tests  instruments and the provision of services in as compared with  was million from additional revenue recognized in the first quarter under contracts with all our us customers for increased donations exceeding contractual minimums 
ortho clinical diagnostics under our joint business contractual arrangement with ortho clinical diagnostics  we manufacture bulk reagents and antigens and confirmatory test kits for immunodiagnostic products 
sales in as compared with remained consistent 
the increase in as compared with primarily related to million from an increase in products manufactured for ortho clinical diagnostics 
in addition  the timing of manufacturing services under the arrangement contributed million to the increase in as compared with we also supply bulk antigens for ortho clinical diagnostics to be included in products to be sold by bayer under a june agreement with ortho clinical diagnostics and bayer corporation see also royalty and license fee revenues bayer below 
we expect competitive pressures related to our blood testing products to continue  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market  as listed in part i  item business competition above 
revenues from joint business arrangement the increase in revenue from joint business arrangement in as compared with was primarily due to i million for higher profits from ortho clinical diagnostics us operations and foreign affiliates and ii million for an increase in royalties 
these increases were partially offset by reorganization charges from the joint business arrangement of million and a one time benefit of million for the three months ended march  due to a change in estimate from a three month lag to a one month lag relating to non us affiliate sales 
prior to the first quarter of  we accounted for revenues relating to ortho clinical diagnostics non us affiliate sales on a one quarter lag 
more current information is now available to us and as such  we now recognize revenues relating to non us affiliate sales on a one month lag  consistent with the method of how we recognize revenues relating to ortho clinical diagnostics sales for the us portion of ortho clinical diagnostics operations 
for more information on this  see critical accounting policies and the use of estimates 
the increase in as compared with primarily resulted from i million from increased profitability of ortho clinical diagnostics foreign affiliates and ii million from a one time benefit in the first quarter mentioned above 
partially offsetting these increases was million from lower profits from ortho clinical diagnostics us operations 
collaborative agreement revenues collaborative agreement revenues tend to fluctuate based on the amount and timing of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of our collaborative agreement revenues  results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
our ability to generate additional collaborative agreement revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
royalty and license fee revenues our blood testing segment earns royalties from third parties based on their sales of immunodiagnostic and nucleic acid testing probe diagnostic products utilizing our hepatitis c virus hcv and hiv related hiv patents  for use in the blood screening and plasma fractionation markets 
our blood testing segment also earns license fees related to our hcv and hiv patents for technologies used by third parties to develop products for use in the blood screening and plasma fractionation markets 
the increase in royalty and license fee revenues in as compared with was primarily due to i million for the settlement with roche  as described below  ii million due to recognition of a portion of the license fee under our license agreements with the german red cross for the use of our hiv and hcv technology for use in molecular probe home brew blood screening and iii million under our licensing agreement with laboratory corporation of america holdings labcorp for our hcv intellectual property for nucleic acid testing nat 
these increases were partially offset by a million license fee from baxter ag related to our hcv and hiv technology for use in the plasma fractionation market in and a million one time payment relating to back royalties  which was recognized in the increase in royalty and license fee revenues in as compared with was primarily due to i million from roche  as discussed below and ii million from baxter  as discussed below 
roche settlement in october  we entered into three license agreements with roche and several of its affiliated companies related to the settlement of certain litigation in the us and certain other countries for the use of our hepatitis c virus and hiv nucleic acid testing intellectual property 
two agreements relate to in vitro diagnostic products 
see other royalty and license fee revenues below 
the third agreement for blood screening was superseded in may by two new agreements  one for each of hcv and hiv 
an hiv related patent directed to nucleic acid testing methods for hiv was issued in the us on march  this patent will expire seventeen years from the date of issuance 
as permitted under the terms of its licensing agreement  roche decided to institute arbitration proceedings in regard to the application of the us patent 
our blood testing segment had deferred recognition of royalties received and royalties accrued under the patent until the resolution of this dispute 
on september   we reached a settlement agreement with roche 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  royalties received prior to march  became non refundable 
for discussion regarding the impact of this settlement on our in vitro diagnostics products  see other royalty and license fee revenue below 
accordingly  in  our blood testing segment recognized revenue of million for royalties up until june   which had previously been deferred 
also under the settlement agreement  in the first quarter of  we are entitled to receive a lump sum payment of million in lieu of royalties beyond january  roche may elect under the terms of the agreement to obtain a partial refund and revert to paying royalties on the sales of its products in north america 
the amount of such potential refund ranges between million and the amount of the refund available decreases in increments over the quarters of and as such  we expect to recognize million of the payment as revenue over and this revenue will be split between our blood testing segment and our other segment 
the remaining million is nonrefundable and was recognized as revenue in  of which  million has been recognized as revenue in our other segment and million has been recognized as revenue in our blood testing segment 
revenues under these blood screening agreements were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million for includes the million of previously deferred revenue recognized in and the million for an aggregate of million of nonrefundable revenue recognized in the impact on revenues in from these items from the september  settlement with roche is summarized under other royalty and license fee revenues below 
the increase in as compared with related to i million from a contractual increase in the royalty rates  ii a million one time payment estimated using an alternative methodology under an agreement with roche relating to back royalties  and iii million from increased blood donations 
german red cross settlement we have granted a non exclusive license to the german red cross for use of our hiv and hcv technology for use in molecular probe home brew blood screening through  for a total license fee payment of million 
of this license fee payment  million was recognized as royalty and license fee revenues in  as discussed above  and the remaining balance is expected to be recognized through  as the cancellation privilege in the related agreements expires 
in addition  the german red cross has the option to license our patents beyond upon payment of an additional fee 
the licensing terms also cover potential past infringements 
labcorp we have entered into a licensing agreement for our hepatitis c virus intellectual property for nucleic acid testing 
the agreement gives labcorp  including its subsidiary  national genetics institute  a semi exclusive license to use our patented hcv nat technology in screening plasma donations in the united states  subject to existing licenses and certain conditions 
in  we recognized a million fee associated with this agreement 
baxter ag in june  we entered into two license agreements with baxter ag related to our hcv and hiv technology for use in the plasma fractionation market 
revenues under these agreements were million and million in and  respectively 
we recognized a license fee of million for these agreements in the second quarter bayer in june  chiron and ortho clinical diagnostics entered into an agreement with bayer corporation bayer for the clinical diagnostic market 
under this agreement  bayer manufactures and sells certain of ortho clinical diagnostics hcv and hiv immunodiagnostic products for use on bayer s instrument platforms 
bayer paid us a license fee of million  which we deferred due to our continuing manufacturing obligations and began recognizing as revenue in the third quarter we will recognize the remaining amount ratably through royalty and license fee revenues may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements  the timing of receipt of license fees and the expiration of patents 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
also  the license agreements typically provide for certain milestone payments and various royalties on future product sales if the licensee commercializes a product using our technology 
however  we have no assurance that the licensee will meet their development objectives or commercialize a product using our technology 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
gross profit margin gross profit margin increased in as compared with due to a positive impact by an adjustment to cost of goods sold in pursuant to our collaboration agreement with gen probe 
the blood testing gross profit margin benefited from an amendment in november to the worldwide blood screening collaboration agreement between chiron and gen probe in order to adopt permanent  fixed revenue shares for each party 
effective january   gen probe s share was set at of net revenues for assays  which include a test for hcv 
for commercial assays  which do not test for hcv  such as the west nile virus assay  the agreement remains unchanged with each party retaining of the net revenues after deduction of specified expenses 
blood testing gross profit margin may fluctuate in future periods as the blood testing product and customer mix changes 
research and development the decrease in research and development expenses in as compared with was primarily due to i million from purchased in process technology associated with our investment in zymequest inc in we are collaborating with zymequest  inc 
to develop and commercialize a enzymatic conversion system which converts group a  b and ab red blood cells to enzyme converted group o eco red blood cells and ii million from costs associated with an agreement with infectio diagnostics inc in  in which we licensed proprietary nucleic acid based technology for the rapid detection of bacterial contamination in platelets and blood products 
these decreases were partially offset by i million due to the increased development efforts relating to nucleic acid testing products in and ii million related to acquisition of in process technologies in  focused primarily on research into variant creutzfeldt jakob disease 
the increase in research and development spending in as compared with is primarily related to i million from purchased in process technology associated with our investment in zymequest inc  as discussed above and ii million from costs associated with an agreement with infectio diagnostics inc  as discussed above 
the remaining increase of million is due to the continued development of nucleic acid testing products 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities 
selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with was primarily due to i million from the support and pre launch costs associated with tigris  a fully automated testing system and ii million from the geographic expansion of our customer base for the procleix hiv hcv assay particularly in latin america and asia markets 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other costs of million 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with related to million from the expansion of our customer base for the procleix hiv hcv assay in the us  europe and other international markets and million from the preparation and roll out of the west nile virus assay under ind testing 
we expect continued growth in selling  general and administrative expenses related to nucleic acid testing technology and products as our sales opportunities expand in new markets through anticipated additional nucleic acid testing adoption

certain of our vaccine products are seasonal  particularly our influenza vaccines  which have higher sales primarily in the second half of the year 
our tick borne encephalitis vaccine is also seasonal with higher sales in the first half of the year 
certain of our vaccines require regulatory approval for production or sale of the product and sales may fluctuate depending on these regulatory approvals 
we expect increased competition for our influenza vaccines business in the future as a result of the recent fluvirin developments 
for more information on this  see fluvirin influenza virus vaccine recent events above 
in addition  we expect menjugate vaccine sales to continue to fluctuate as public health authorities consider adoption of broad vaccination programs and competitive pressures continue to increase 
collaborative agreement revenues we recognize collaborative agreement revenues for fees received as we perform research services and achieve specified milestones 
collaborative agreement revenues in as compared with increased primarily due to i million in higher milestone payments related to an agreement to supply menzb meningococcal b vaccine to the ministry of health in new zealand and ii million in increased collaborative agreement revenues following a full year of collaborative revenues in from our acquisition of powderject 
in the first quarter  we entered into an agreement to supply a vaccine for meningococcal meningitis caused by the bacterium n 
meningitidis serogroup b to the ministry of health in new zealand

the fluctuations resulted from a change in the level of contract manufacturing activities 
the balance of other revenues consisted of various other agreements  which individually were not material 
other revenues recognized in our vaccines segment may fluctuate due to the nature of the revenues recognized and the timing of events giving rise to these revenues 
gross profit gross profit margin declined in as compared with primarily due to i the fact that there were no fluvirin vaccine sales for the influenza season and ii a million charge to cost of sales resulting from the write off of our entire inventory of fluvirin vaccine 
in addition  included approximately million in fluvirin vaccine remediation costs  which were charged to cost of sales 
gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by reduced sales and margins of the menjugate product 
these decreases were offset by higher prices of our other influenza vaccines products and increased sales of our rabies vaccine in the us market 
the decrease in gross profit margin in as compared with related to a fair value adjustment to inventory of million in associated with the sale of inventory acquired during the acquisition of powderject 
these additional costs related to a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of powderject 
in addition  the vaccine gross profit margin in was negatively impacted by the shutdown of certain facilities  in the first quarter  to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements 
vaccines gross profit margin does not include amortization expense from acquired developed products  an intangible asset related to business combinations 
such amortization expense is included in the caption amortization expense discussed below 
vaccines gross profit margin may fluctuate significantly in future periods due to product and customer mix  seasonality and ordering patterns  production yields  regulatory approvals and competitive pressures 
research and development the increase in research and development expenses in as compared with was primarily due to i million from flu cell culture and ii million from the advancement of several programs in our meningococcal franchise

betaseron interferon beta b we manufacture interferon beta b which is marketed by schering ag and its affiliates  including berlex laboratories  inc collectively schering  under the trade names betaseron in the u 
s and other non european markets and betaferon in europe 
boehringer ingelheim also supplies betaferon interferon beta b to schering for sale in europe 
for product manufactured by us  we recognize a portion of revenue for product sales upon shipment to schering and the remainder based on a contractual percentage of sales by schering  both of which we record as product sales 
for product manufactured by boehringer ingelheim and marketed by schering in europe under the trade name betaferon  we receive royalties calculated at the same percentage of sales less the amount paid or incurred by schering for supply costs  which we record in royalty and license fee revenues 
starting in the fourth quarter  the amount we record as product sales and betaferon royalties  based on a percentage of sales by schering  declined by five percentage points pursuant to our contractual agreement with schering 
as a result  we estimate that the percentage of sales per unit on which our payments are based will decrease  reducing our per unit revenue by approximately for sales of chiron product and approximately for royalties from sales of boehringer ingelheim product from that received prior to the decline 
however  there are a number of mitigating considerations  including i the transitional supply agreement  ii the volume mix of chiron product and boehringer ingelheim product and iii the launch of product upgrades with ease of use features 
we believe these considerations will partially offset this contractual change 
in october  the us food and drug administration approved a new pre filled diluent syringe for betaseron interferon beta b 
the pre filled diluent syringe was launched in january and enhances the delivery mode and shortens preparation  helping to simplify injections of betaseron interferon beta b 
in the first quarter  the us food and drug administration approved new labeling for betaseron interferon beta b 
the labeling expands the indication for betaseron interferon beta b to treat all relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency of clinical exacerbations 
relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis include relapsing remitting  the most common form  and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with relapses 
pursuant to our agreement with schering  we began supplying betaferon product to schering in the fourth quarter for certain additional european markets  which were previously supplied by boehringer ingelheim 
this resulted in a shift of revenue recognized under this agreement to product sales  and a decrease in royalty revenues beginning in the fourth quarter in  schering extended its supply agreement with boehringer ingelheim through the exact shift of revenue in the future will be contingent on our production capacity  schering s minimum purchase commitment under the extended supply agreement with boehringer ingelheim  and market demand 
the shift to product sales is expected to increase over the next three years 
we expect overall  biopharmaceutical earnings to be largely unaffected by the transition 
in order to supply betaferon to schering  we are required to make capital improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities to increase capacity 
during  and  we recorded charges related to process development and test runs associated with this project 
see research and development below 
the increase in betaseron product sales in as compared with primarily related to an additional i million from price increases  ii million from increased patient demand attributed to key marketing programs  iii million from the benefit of foreign exchange rates  iv million from inventory ordering patterns of schering and their distributors and v million from increased sales of clinical materials 
these increases were partially offset by an million reduction due to a decline in the royalty rate by five percentage points pursuant to our contractual agreement with schering 
the increase in betaseron product sales in as compared with  primarily related to i million from price increases  ii million from the benefit of the movement in foreign exchange rates and iii million from increased patient demand attributed to an overall increase in the market for interferon beta b products for multiple sclerosis 
these increases were partially offset by i million from a decline in the amount we recorded as product sales  based on a percentage of sales by schering  by five percentage points pursuant to our contractual agreement with schering and ii million from fluctuations in wholesaler ordering patterns 
in  schering converted to wholesaler distribution from direct distribution method 
prior to the first quarter  we accounted for revenues from non us product sales based on information provided by schering on a one quarter lag 
more current information of non us betaseron interferon beta b sales became available in  and as a result  we were able to begin recognizing revenues from betaseron product sales on a current basis 
this change resulted in incremental revenues recognized during the first quarter of million 
inventory ordering patterns as well as foreign currency exchange rates may influence future betaseron product sales 
tobi tobramycin solution for inhalation we sell tobi solution directly in the us and certain international markets

prior to  we accounted for betaferon product royalties as a percentage of forecast received from schering  with an adjustment of the estimate to actual in the subsequent quarter 
more current information of european betaseron product sales was available in  and as a result  we were able to recognize betaferon product royalties on a current basis beginning in the first quarter as discussed in product sales betaseron above  we began supplying betaferon product  which was previously supplied by boehringer ingelheim  to schering in the fourth quarter for certain additional european markets 
this resulted in a shift of revenue recognized under this agreement to product sales  with a decrease in royalty revenues  beginning in the fourth quarter in  schering extended its supply agreement with boehringer ingelheim through the magnitude of the shift of revenue in the future will be contingent on our production capacity  schering s minimum purchase commitment under the extended supply agreement with boehringer ingelheim and market demand

the decrease is primarily due to initial license fees recognized in glaxosmithkline plc in  we granted glaxosmithkline plc rights to certain of our mc r compound patents 
under this arrangement  we recognized royalty revenues million and million in and  respectively 
the project associated with our mc r compound was completed early in the balance of royalty and license fee revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other agreements  which individually were not material 
royalty and license fee revenues may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements  the timing of receipt of license fees and the expiration of patents 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
also  the license agreements typically provide for certain milestone payments and various royalties on future product sales if the licensees commercialize a product using our technology 
however  we have no assurance that the licensees will meet their development objectives or commercialize a product using our technology 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
other revenues contract manufacturing revenues our biopharmaceuticals segment recognized contract manufacturing revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in as compared with and in as compared with  resulted from the level of activity and the timing of contract manufacturing activities 
biogen and serono settlements as a result of a favorable federal court decision and prior agreements between chiron and schering s us subsidiary  berlex laboratories  and berlex and biogen  biogen was required to make a settlement payment to schering 
in accordance with an earlier contract between chiron and berlex  we recognized approximately million as revenue in  which represented our share of this settlement payment 
in addition  there was a similar settlement between berlex and serono  sa of which we recognized approximately million in the balance of other revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment consisted of various other arrangements  which individually were not material 
other revenues recognized in our biopharmaceuticals segment may fluctuate due to the nature of the revenues recognized and the timing of events giving rise to these revenues 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining additional revenues or that these revenues will not decline 
gross profit the biopharmaceutical gross profit margin in was consistent with the gross profit margin in price increases were offset by the contractual change in the royalty rate related to the sale of betaseron product and the increased costs associated with the pre filled diluent syringe for betaseron product 
the decrease in biopharmaceutical gross profit margin in as compared with was the result of higher annual facility maintenance costs  non recurring expenses related to production  less favorable mix of biopharmaceutical product sales  the increased cost of producing the betaseron interferon beta b pre filled syringe presentation and a decline in betaseron product sales  based on a percentage of sales by schering  by five percentage points pursuant to our contractual agreement with schering  offset by price increases 
biopharmaceutical gross profit margin does not include amortization expense from acquired developed products  an intangible asset related to business combinations 
such amortization expense is included in the caption amortization expense 
biopharmaceutical gross profit margin may fluctuate significantly in future periods due to production yields  increased cost to produce the betaseron interferon beta b pre filled diluent syringe  the decline in betaseron product sales  based on a percentage of sales by schering  which decreased by five percentage points pursuant to our contractual agreement with schering and as the biopharmaceutical product and customer mix changes 
research and development the increase in research and development spending in as compared with was primarily the result of i million from activities related to the development of tifacogin  as discussed below  ii million from development of our early stage oncology compounds chir small molecule and chir an antibody and iii million from pre registration activities for pulminiq cyclosporine  usp inhalation solution for the increase in survival and prevention of chronic rejection in patients receiving allogenic lung transplants  in combination with standard immunosuppressive therapy 
these increases were partially offset by i a reduction of million due to the discontinued development of tezacitabine in the first quarter of based on an analysis of the data from a phase ii trial in patients with gastroesophageal cancer  ii a decline of million in spending due to discontinuance of development of pa  iii a decline of million due to a decline in expenses related to the development of new processes and the performance of test runs related to installed equipment of our existing manufacturing facilities to support the supply of betaferon interferon beta b to schering and iv a net decline of million in spending related to the pre registration activities of cubicin daptomycin for injection for treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections 
during we recorded million of expense associated with a fee paid under a license agreement with cubist pharmaceuticals  inc for the development and commercialization of cubist s antibiotic daptomycin  as discussed below 
in  we expensed million to fund the remaining obligations of the silcaat trial due to assessment of no future benefit from the trial 
the increase in research and development spending in as compared with primarily related to i million from costs associated with a license agreement with cubist pharmaceuticals  inc for the development and commercialization of cubist s antibiotic daptomycin  as discussed below  ii million from those activities related to the development of tezacitabine  obtained as a part of the acquisition of matrix pharmaceutical in the first quarter and iii million from interleukin in oncology trials in combination with various monoclonal antibodies 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the activities for various clinical trials  including i million from transfer of the responsibility of the silcaat trial to niaid and the university of minnesota in the fourth quarter  discussed below  and ii million from termination of our development activities for hbv mf  an immunotherapy for patients with chronic hepatitis b infection 
in march  chiron entered into a worldwide  exclusive  multi product  collaborative arrangement with xoma ltd

in october  we entered into a license agreement with cubist pharmaceuticals  inc for the development and commercialization of cubist s antibiotic cubicin daptomycin for injection in western and eastern europe  australia  new zealand  india and certain central american  south american and middle eastern countries 
in exchange for these development and commercialization rights  we have agreed to pay cubist up to million 
this million includes million  which was paid by chiron up front in the fourth quarter  million of which was used to purchase restricted cubist common stock at a percent premium over market price and up to million of additional payments to cubist upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones 
we will also pay cubist a tiered royalty on cubicin marketed by chiron 
we recorded million of the up front payment  related to the purchase of in process research and development as research and development expense in the fourth quarter in october  we acquired all of pfizer  inc s  formerly pharmacia corp 
s  interest in tifacogin  in return for which pfizer will receive royalties on future sales of tifacogin 
in the second quarter  we began enrolling patients in our phase iii trial for tifacogin as a treatment for patients with severe community acquired pneumonia 
in april  we acquired exclusive worldwide development and commercial rights from novartis for pulminiq cyclosporine  usp inhalation solution  a therapy under evaluation for treatment of rejection and reduction of mortality in lung transplant recipients for million  which was expensed as research and development costs in in  we submitted a new drug application to the fda for marketing approval of pulminiq 
in the fourth quarter  we reached an agreement in principle to transfer responsibility for the silcaat trial  a phase iii study for recombinant human interleukin il  aldesleukin  to the national institutes allergy and infectious disease niaid and the university of minnesota 
responsibility for the silcaat study was transferred to niaid and university of minnesota effective february  our research and development expenses related to the silcaat trial decreased in as a result of the transfer 
under the agreement  we are obligated to fund a maximum of million over the lifetime of the trial and to supply clinical materials and certain other support services of which million has been paid through december  research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities 
selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with was primarily due to i million for increased expenses for new product support  ii million for the euro to us dollar exchange rate fluctuation and iii million for increased expenses for programs and headcount in support of tobi tobramycin and international marketing  iv million related to increased costs of our facilities  v million increase for support to enhance business processes and vi for increased sales and medical affairs support 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with related to i million from ongoing sales and marketing programs to support tobi in the us and continued market penetration in europe  ii investment in marketing capabilities to support clinical programs  iii million from additional costs associated with the enhancement of current business processes and iv million from the euro to us dollar exchange rate fluctuation 
in addition  the increase in as compared with was impacted by million from increased costs following the acquisition of pulmopharm in the third quarter amortization expense the increase in amortization expense in compared with related to the distribution rights acquired upon acquisition of pulmopharm in the third quarter we acquired pathogenesis corporation in and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price to purchased technologies  acquired intangible assets and goodwill  which related to the biopharmaceuticals segment 
other we view certain other revenues and expenses  particularly certain royalty and license fee revenues primarily related to hiv and hcv related patents  and unallocated corporate expenses  as not belonging to any one reportable segment 
as a result  we have aggregated these items into an other segment

roche settlement in october  we entered into three license agreements with roche and several of its affiliated companies related to the settlement of certain litigation in the us and certain other countries for use of our hcv and hiv nucleic acid testing intellectual property 
two agreements relate to in vitro diagnostics products 
the third agreement relates to blood screening 
see blood testing royalty and license fee revenues above for more information on these agreements 
under the hepatitis c virus agreement  we received million  of which we recognized million in the fourth quarter we deferred the remaining million  which becomes nonrefundable through in the first quarter  we began recognizing portions of the million based upon the greater of i the scheduled quarterly minimum non refundable amount or ii the actual earned credits as royalties on future sales related to roche s use of our hcv related patent in its in vitro diagnostic products 
the agreement also provides for royalties on future sales related to roche s use of our hcv related patent in its in vitro diagnostic products  which commenced in the first quarter royalty revenues increased in as compared with  by million or 
royalty revenues decreased million or in as compared with as the annual minimum royalty under this agreement expired at the end of the hiv agreement also provides for royalties on future sales related to roche s use of our hiv related patent in its in vitro diagnostic products  which commenced in the first quarter when the european patent office board of technical appeals upheld our hiv related patent 
royalty revenues recognized under this agreement increased by million in as compared with this increase is mainly due to a settlement agreement with roche  described in more detail below  in which we recognized revenues for a license fee  deferred royalties and a portion of a nonrefundable royalty payment 
royalty revenues recognized under this agreement in were consistent with an hiv related patent directed to nucleic acid testing methods for hiv was issued in the us on march  this patent will expire seventeen years from the date of issuance 
the issuance of the patent triggered a milestone payment to us of million from roche  which was received in april as permitted under the terms of its licensing agreement  roche decided to institute arbitration proceedings in regard to the application of the us patent 
we had deferred recognition of the million milestone payment  interest  royalties received and royalties accrued under the patent until the resolution of this dispute 
on september   we reached a settlement agreement with roche 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the milestone payment along with any royalties received prior to march  became non refundable

also under the settlement agreement  in the first quarter of  we are entitled to receive a lump sum payment of million in lieu of royalties beyond january  roche may elect under the terms of the agreement to obtain a partial refund and revert to paying royalties on the sales of its products in north america 
the amount of such potential refund ranges between million and million 
the amount of the refund available decreases in increments over the quarters of and as such  chiron expects to recognize million of the payment as revenue over and the remaining million is nonrefundable and was recognized as revenue in  of which million has been recognized as revenue in our other segment and million has been recognized as revenue in our blood testing segment 
revenues earned from diagnostic products are included in our other segment and revenues earned from blood screening are included in our blood testing segment

royalty and license fee revenues may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements  the timing of receipt of license fees and the expiration of patents 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with was primarily due to million in legal costs related to the fluvirin vaccine developments discussed above under fluvirin influenza virus vaccine recent events  million in legal costs related to the defense of our patents and technology and million from corporate governance costs 
these increases were partially offset by million from a donation to chiron foundation and million from lower employee related expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared with was primarily due to million from an increase in employee related expenses  million from a donation to chiron foundation  million from integration costs incurred by the other segment associated with our third quarter acquisition of powderject and million from an impairment charge associated with long lived assets 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in spending related to the defense of our patents and technology 
purchased in process research and development purchased in process research and development charged to operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on july   we acquired sagres discovery and accounted for the acquisition as an asset purchase 
we allocated the purchase price based on fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed

we allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we allocated million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development  which we charged to operations in we do not anticipate that there will be any alternative future use for the in process research and development 
in valuing the purchased in process research and development  we used probability of success adjusted cash flows and a discount rate 
cash flows from projects including those relating to i certain travel vaccines and ii vaccines for allergies were assumed to commence between and on february   we acquired matrix pharmaceutical  inc and accounted for the acquisition as an asset purchase 
we allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we allocated million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development  which we charged to operations in we do not anticipate that there will be any alternative future use for the in process research and development

we assumed revenue from tezacitabine to commence after development of tezacitabine was discontinued in the first quarter of based on the analysis of the data from a phase ii trial in patients with gastroesophageal cancer 
as with all pharmaceutical products  the probability of commercial success for any research and development project is highly uncertain 
interest expense the increase in interest expense in as compared with primarily related to the effect of twelve months versus five months of interest expense recognized on the million convertible debentures that we issued on july  also  interest expense increased due to interest on the million convertible debentures that we issued on june  these increases were partially offset by lower interest expense from certain of our liquid yield options notes lyons  which were put to us on june  the increase in as compared with primarily related to interest expense recognized on the million convertible debentures that were issued on july  interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  primarily consisted of interest income on our cash and investment balances and other non operating gains and losses 
we recognized interest income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in as compared with primarily was due to lower average cash and investment balances following the acquisition of powderject and lower average interest rates 
in  and  we recognized gains of million  million and million  respectively  related to the sale of certain equity securities 
the increase in is primarily due to the termination of certain equity forward contracts 
in  we recognized losses attributable to the impairment of equity securities of million 
there were no losses attributable to impairment of equity securities in in  we recognized losses attributable to the impairment of certain equity securities of million

the charges for the purchased in process research and development in and are not tax deductible 
the effective tax rate in and were both of pretax income from continuing operations  after excluding the impact of the purchased in process research and development charges 
the effective tax rate in includes increased benefits from research tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower rates 
such benefits are a greater percentage of pretax income in than in these benefits were offset by the tax cost of transferring certain product rights through inter company transactions as part of our long term tax planning strategy 
the reported effective tax rate in was of pretax income from continuing operations  including the charge for purchased in process research and development related to the matrix pharmaceutical acquisition 
the effective tax rate in was of pretax income from continuing operations  after excluding the impact of the in process research and development charge 
the effective tax rate is lower than the effective tax rate due to an increase in income earned in lower tax jurisdictions  net of increased benefits recognized in with respect to our research and development activities 
the effective tax rate may be affected in future periods by changes in management s estimates with respect to our deferred tax assets and other items affecting the overall tax rate 
management believes the acquisition of powderject may cause an increase in the future effective tax rate and is in the process of evaluating certain options that may mitigate any potential increase 
specifically  most of powderject s profits earned are in the united kingdom  subject to a marginal tax rate 
discontinued operations in a strategic effort to focus on our core businesses of blood testing  vaccines and biopharmaceuticals  we completed the sale of chiron diagnostics to bayer and chiron vision to bausch lomb in and  respectively 
the gain loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes consisted of the following for the years ended december in thousands reversal of reserves net charge for indemnity obligations gain resulting from irs settlement employee settlement reversal of income tax reserves from bayer settlement income tax benefit chiron and bayer corporation  or bayer  were involved in a dispute with respect to their respective rights to certain royalty refunds receivable for which a settlement was reached in under this settlement agreement  we made a settlement payment to bayer in this settlement includes an agreement that all outstanding items with bayer related to the sale of chiron diagnostics are resolved and no future indemnity obligations are required

new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued or on the fair value of liabilities incurred 
under sfas r  the fair value based method for recognition or disclosure of compensation expense will be applied using the modified prospective application transition method or the modified retrospective application transition method 
we currently measure compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation under the intrinsic method 
the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
current option values of using the black scholes formula  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  may not be indicative of results from the valuation methodologies we finally adopt 
the adoption of sfas r is effective for chiron commencing the beginning of the third quarter liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements have generally been funded by cash flow from operations  borrowings from commercial banks and issuance of convertible debt securities and common stock 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities  which totaled  million at december   are invested in a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities  including money market instruments  corporate notes and bonds  and government agency securities issued by financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings 
by policy  the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited 
investments are generally not collateralized and primarily mature within three years 
the recent events regarding fluvirin vaccine  as discussed above  will continue to impact our cash flow going forward 
as we continue to implement our remediation plan  our efforts will entail additional cash payments  which will be material 
the mhra s lifting of our license suspension is conditioned upon the understanding that our commitment to remediation will continue 
in addition  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expense relating to the investigation by the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york  the securities and exchange commission formal investigation and the shareholder class action and derivative private lawsuits and other claims arising out of or related to these developments regarding fluvirin vaccine 
in addition  our inability to supply fluvirin vaccine for the season may also lead to loss of market share because competitors have announced plans to introduce influenza vaccine products in the united states during the season and are seeking expedited regulatory approval to do so 
even though the license suspension has been lifted  some of our customers may choose to purchase flu vaccine from other providers as their products become available in the united states 
loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on cash flow 
we are subject to investigations  litigation and disputes in connection with the fluvirin developments 
the results of any such investigations  proceedings or disputes could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow

on june   certain holders of our liquid yield option notes lyons  at their option  tendered lyons with million in aggregate principal amount at maturity  which we were required to purchase 
the purchase price for the tendered lyons was in cash per  in principal amount at maturity 
the aggregate purchase price for all the lyons validly surrendered for purchase was million 
at december   there remains million outstanding in aggregate principal amount at maturity with a current accreted balance of million 
on june   we issued million aggregate principal amount of new convertible debentures  which mature on june  the convertible debentures accrue interest at a rate of per year with interest payable each june and december commencing december  the debentures are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
under the terms of the investment agreement between novartis and chiron  novartis agreed to guarantee certain chiron obligations up to a maximum of million 
under this agreement  novartis has guaranteed million under a us credit facility in which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  and million from a lease commitment for a research and development facility in emeryville  california 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities  together with funds provided by operations and borrowing and leasing arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable operating cash requirements over at least the next twelve months including any cash needed for remediation efforts for our liverpool plant  cash utilized for our stock repurchase program and our contractual obligations of million in the next twelve months as discussed in the contractual obligation table below 
we also believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities  together with funds provided by operations and lease arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our contractual obligations of billion arising after twelve months as discussed in the contractual obligations table below 
in addition  we believe we could access additional funds from the debt and capital markets should the need arise 
as noted above  if we suffer a permanent loss of fluvirin influenza vaccine sales  whether through loss of regulatory approvals  market share or otherwise  it would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
sources and uses of cash we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively 
operating activities in  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared with million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations before depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  which decreased mainly due to the suspension of our license to manufacture fluvirin influenza virus vaccine in our liverpool facility which prevented the release of any of the product during the influenza season 
cash provided by operating activities also decreased due to i increased selling  general and administration expenses in primarily due to the movement of the euro and british pound exchange rates  twelve months of selling  general and administrative expenses from powderject in compared to approximately six months in and increased legal costs  ii lower royalty payments of betaseron and betaferon interferon beta b due to a decline in the royalty rate by five percentage points pursuant to our contractual arrangement with schering  and lower royalty payments received under the roche royalty arrangements in compared with and iii million of cash received as a result of the biogen and serono settlements in connection with the mccormick patents in these decreases were offset by i lower tax payments in as compared with  ii a payment to bayer corporation in from a settlement agreement relating to certain claims raised by bayer in connection with the stock purchase agreement dated september  and iii increased product sales of procleix assays and tobi tobramycin in in  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared with million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to i higher income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization and other non cash charges  which increased mainly due to flu vaccine sales following the acquisition of powderject and higher product sales of procleix assays  partially offset by increases in research and development costs 
increases in research and development costs were primarily due to the development of a dry powder formulation of our inhaled tobi tobramycin product  the development of tezacitabine  the development of interleukin in combination with various monoclonal antibodies  expansion of our meningococcal franchise and development of flu cell culture 
we also incurred costs associated with our collaboration with zymequest inc to develop and commercialize an enzymatic conversion system  our license agreement with infectio diagnostics  and the in licensing of daptomycin  ii higher royalty payments received under the betaferon interferon beta b and roche royalty arrangements  iii million of cash received as a result of the biogen and serono settlements in connection with the mccormick patents see biopharmaceuticals other revenues above  iv an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at december  as compared to a decrease at december  driven by the timing of payments and our acquisition of powderject and v excluding the effect of acquisitions  a decrease in inventories at december  as compared to an increase in inventories at december  partially offsetting these increases was a payment made to bayer corporation as a result of a settlement agreement relating to certain claims raised by bayer under the stock purchase agreement dated september  in  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared with million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities largely was due to i higher income from operations before the charge for in process research and development  depreciation and amortization and other non cash charges and ii increased cash due to the timing of payments received under the betaferon interferon beta b and roche royalty arrangements 
these increases were partially offset by i the million license fee payment received from bayer in june  ii increased accounts receivable primarily driven by increases in product sales and royalty receivables due to an increase in betaferon product sales and increased blood screening royalties due to contractual price increases and increased blood testing volume  iii lower accrued liabilities and other payables due to the timing of payments and iv increased payments in increased payments in as compared with  included payments to i gen probe upon resolution of certain contractual disputes which were accrued for in the fourth quarter and ii the german government in lieu of statutory price reductions on prescription drugs that are reimbursed under the german government s healthcare program 
we anticipate that research and development expenditures in will primarily be driven by i the furtherance of our phase iii study and other development activities for tifacogin as a treatment for patients with severe community acquired pneumonia ii initiation of a phase iii study and production of a dry powder formulation of our inhaled tobi product for the treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients under our december collaboration agreement with nektar therapeutics  iii early stage oncology studies and other development activities for chiron compounds chir and chir iv expansion of our meningococcal franchise  v development of flu cell culture  vi research activities focused on identifying several novel vaccines and therapeutics for clinical development in the areas of oncology and infectious disease 
in addition  we are required to make capital improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities to support the supply of betaferon product to schering 
in connection with this project  we are continuing to incur expenses relating to the development of new processes and the performance of test runs related to installed equipment 
net cash from operating activities are expected to fund these research and development activities

in  our board of directors approved million in expenditures for a year building lease and million for capital improvements  both of which are part of a million project for expansion and replacement of our flu vaccines manufacturing facility in liverpool  england 
the new manufacturing facility will replace a portion of the existing flu vaccines manufacturing facilities in liverpool  england and is anticipated to be available in the middle of for the manufacture of flu vaccines  subject to regulatory approval 
in december  we entered into a year lease for the building  as of december   we have incurred million for the capital improvements portion of the project 
management does not currently expect the recent fluvirin vaccine developments to impact the timing of this project 
in april  we entered into a collaboration with rhein biotech nv now part of berna biotech and greencross vaccine corporation to research and develop certain pediatric combination vaccine products for sale outside of europe and north america 
the collaboration agreement requires capital commitments from chiron  berna biotech and greencross vaccine

in july  we entered into a new six year lease to rent a research and development facility in emeryville  california r d property following the expiration of the existing lease accounted for as an operating lease 
we accounted for this new lease as a capital lease and  as a result  recorded the leased asset and the corresponding liability of million on our balance sheet 
this amount represents the present value of minimum lease payments  including the residual value guarantee 
the lease provides a million residual value guarantee from us to the lessors in the event fair value of the r d property declines below the total investment of million made by the lessors in the r d property 
consequently  our maximum payment obligation is million upon termination of the lease on or before july  the leased asset is amortized  using a straight line method  to an amount such that the capital lease liability  net of the book value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term equals an amount that may become payable to the lessor due to an estimated decline in fair value of the leased asset below the lessors total investment of million 
we estimated the fair value of the r d property at the end of the lease term will be approximately million 
the fair value at the end of the lease term was estimated using the cost approach in which appraised value at lease inception is modified by estimates for building cost appreciation and building component depreciation through the six year lease term 
this valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe the fair value assigned is based on reasonable assumptions 
aggregate amortization of the leased asset over the term of the lease is estimated to be approximately million 
for the years ended december  and  million and million were recorded as amortization expense for the capital lease 
at the inception of the lease  the future minimum lease payments  exclusive of a residual value guarantee  are approximately million over the lease term 
the lease payments represent variable rate interest payments indexed to a three month london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
under the lease  on or before july   we can choose to either purchase the facility from the lessors or sell the facility to a third party 
if we choose to purchase this property the specified purchase consideration under the lease agreement is million 
this option accelerates if we default on our lease payments or in the event of other defined events

market risk management our cash flow from operations and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  the fair value of equity securities held and the realized value of investment securities sold 
we attempt to limit our exposure to some or all of these market risks through the use of various financial instruments 
these activities are discussed in further detail in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk factors that may affect future results as a global biopharmaceutical company  we are engaged in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business 
the forward looking statements contained in this k and in other periodic reports  press releases and other statements issued by us from time to time reflect our current beliefs and expectations concerning objectives  plans  strategies  future performance and other future events 
the following discussion highlights some of the factors  many of which are beyond our control  which could cause actual results to differ 
the recent developments with respect to fluvirin vaccine will harm our business and results of operations 
during the third quarter of  in conducting final internal release procedures for our fluvirin influenza virus vaccine  our quality systems identified lots that did not meet product sterility specifications 
as a result  we determined at the time to delay releasing any fluvirin vaccine doses pending completion of internal investigations 
on october   the uk regulatory body  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  or mhra  sent us a letter prohibiting us from releasing any fluvirin vaccine doses manufactured at our liverpool facility since march  and suspending our license to manufacture influenza virus vaccine in our liverpool facility for three months later extended for an additional three months 
in that letter  the mhra asserted that our manufacturing process did not comply with uk good manufacturing practices regulations 
following the mhra s decision and an inspection by the food and drug administration  or fda  the fda sent us a warning letter on december  citing violations of good manufacturing practices 
we provided the fda with a written response to the warning letter on january  in a subsequent letter to us  the fda stated that our responses appear to be adequate  but that implementation and effectiveness of our corrective actions and overall compliance would be evaluated in a subsequent inspection 
as a result of the license suspension  we did not release any fluvirin product during the influenza season 
on march   the mhra notified us that it had lifted the license suspension  giving chiron clearance to initiate full production of fluvirin vaccine  conditioned on the understanding that chiron s commitment to its remediation plan will continue 
the fda is still expected to conduct a full inspection to determine whether deficiencies noted in its warning letter have been resolved 
if we fail to adequately address the matters discussed in the warning letter  the fda may modify our us license in an adverse manner  take action that could result in imposition of fines  require temporary or permanent cessation of future selling of fluvirin vaccine or take other action that could reduce our ability to market fluvirin vaccine 
we received a grand jury subpoena issued by the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york in october requesting production of certain documents relating to fluvirin vaccine and the suspension by the mhra of our license 
in february  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  notified us that it would commence a formal investigation into whether we or our employees have violated any federal securities laws in connection with these developments regarding fluvirin  after having previously commenced an informal inquiry 
we also received a voluntary request for information from the united states house of representatives committee on energy and commerce requesting production of certain documents 
numerous documents have been collected and produced in response to these requests  and several witnesses have been interviewed by the us attorney s office and the sec staff and additional interviews are anticipated 
additional investigations regarding these matters may arise 
in addition  we and certain of our officers and directors have also been named as defendants in several putative shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits alleging various claims arising out of or relating to these developments regarding fluvirin  which are described above in part i  item  legal proceedings 
certain parties with which we have contracted to supply fluvirin are considering claims against us as a result of our inability to supply fluvirin vaccine  and additional parties may do so in the future 
on january   the us centers for disease control and prevention terminated its contracts with chiron for the supply of flu vaccine for default on the basis of chiron s failure to supply such vaccine to the us government for the flu season 
the cdc has reserved the right to hold chiron liable for any excess costs it may incur if it chooses to replace the flu vaccine that chiron failed to deliver and further has reserved all other remedies provided under the contract 
chiron maintains that its failure to deliver does not constitute default  because its reasons for non performance fall within the excusable delay provisions of contracts with the cdc 
we have also received communications from certain distributors of fluvirin vaccine suggesting that they are entitled to compensation under their contracts for the season 
it is not possible to predict whether any of these claims will be pursued and  if so  whether those claims will be upheld 
investigations  litigation and disputes have caused us to incur substantial expense and have required significant time and attention from our management and will continue to do so in the future and could result in civil action and or criminal penalties against chiron 
the results of any such investigations  proceedings or disputes could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
from more information on these lawsuits  investigations and claims  see part i  item legal proceedings above 
we did not release any fluvirin vaccine during the influenza season 
as a result  our results of operations for were materially adversely affected by these matters 
additional issues with respect to fluvirin vaccine could cause us to have to recognize an impairment charge with respect to the goodwill  certain other intangible assets and the liverpool plant resulting from the powderject acquisition and the new flu vaccines manufacturing facility under construction in liverpool  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our inability to supply fluvirin vaccine during the influenza season may also lead to loss of market share in the season and future seasons 
following the announcement of our license suspension  competitors have announced plans to introduce influenza vaccine products in the united states and are seeking expedited regulatory approval to do so 
even though the license suspension has been lifted  some of our customers may choose to purchase flu vaccine from other providers as their products become available in the united states 
loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
although the mhra has lifted its suspension of our license to manufacture fluvirin vaccine  we expect to incur additional expenses in connection with ongoing fluvirin vaccine matters  which could be material  including in connection with our continuing remediation efforts at our liverpool facility  and responding to the us attorney for the southern district of new york  the sec  the united states house of representatives committee on energy and commerce and the private lawsuits and other claims and investigations that may arise 
for additional information on the us attorney s investigation  sec investigation  private lawsuits and other claims  see part i  item legal proceedings of this report on form k 
if we fail to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals we need to market our products or substantial changes in the regulatory environment occur  our business may suffer 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approval in order to market most of our products 
generally  these approvals are on a product by product and country by country basis 
in the case of fluvirin  the failure to obtain or maintain our licenses  or delays imposed by regulatory actions  could lead to the loss of our entire inventory during any given season since each year s vaccines are manufactured to meet specific strains of flu 
in the case of therapeutic products  a separate approval is required for each therapeutic indication 
product candidates that appear promising based on early  and even large scale  clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval 
the results of clinical trials often are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent approval or result in the need for post marketing studies 
in addition  regulations may be amended from time to time 
revised regulations may require us to reformulate products on a country or regional basis  obtain additional regulatory approvals  or accept additional risks that our products will not maintain market acceptance or be eligible for third party insurance coverage 
increased regulatory scrutiny and restrictions regarding marketing practices for products that are subject to government reimbursement may impact the sales of such products 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to satisfy these new regulatory requirements and may suffer a loss of revenue as a result 
if our focus on the research and development of emerging technologies does not result in the creation of commercial products  our business could be harmed 
we focus our research and development activities on areas in which we have particular strengths and on technologies that appear promising 
these technologies often are on the cutting edge of modern science 
as a result  the outcome of any research or development program is highly uncertain 
only a very small fraction of these programs ultimately result in commercial products or even product candidates 
product candidates that initially appear promising often fail to yield successful products 
in many cases  preclinical or clinical studies will show that a product candidate is not efficacious that is  it lacks the intended therapeutic or prophylactic effect  or that it raises safety concerns or has other side effects  which outweigh the intended benefit 
success in preclinical or early clinical trials which generally focus on safety issues may not translate into success in large scale clinical trials which are designed to show efficacy  often for reasons that are not fully understood 
further  success in clinical trials will likely lead to increased investment  adversely affecting short term profitability  to bring such products to market 
and even after a product is approved and launched  general usage or post marketing studies may identify safety or other previously unknown problems with the product which may result in regulatory approvals being suspended  limited to narrow indications or revoked  or which may otherwise prevent successful commercialization 
our products are complex and difficult to manufacture on a large scale basis  which could cause us to delay product launches  experience shortages of products or prevent us from offering products on a volume basis 
most of our products are biologics 
manufacturing biologic products is complex 
unlike chemical pharmaceuticals  a biologic product generally cannot be sufficiently characterized in terms of its physical and chemical properties to rely on assaying of the finished product alone to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner 
accordingly  it is essential to be able to both validate and control the manufacturing process  that is  to show that the process works and that the product is made strictly and consistently in compliance with that process 
slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process  including quality control  labeling and packaging  may result in unacceptable changes in the products that may result in lot failures or product recalls  or liability to a third party to the extent we are contract manufacturing products in our facilities for such third party 
manufacturing processes which are used to produce the smaller quantities of material needed for research and development purposes may not be successfully scaled up to allow production of commercial quantities at reasonable cost or at all 
all of these difficulties are compounded when dealing with novel biologic products that require novel manufacturing processes 
additionally  manufacturing is subject to extensive government regulation 
even minor changes in the manufacturing process require regulatory approval  which  in turn  may require further clinical studies 
for some of our products  we rely on others to supply raw materials and to manufacture those products according to regulatory requirements 
in addition  any prolonged interruption in our operations or those of our partners could result in our inability to satisfy the product demands of our customers 
a number of factors could cause interruptions  including equipment malfunctions or failures  interruptions due to labor action  damage to a facility due to natural disasters  such as an earthquake  suspension of power supplied to these facilities arising out of regional power shortages or terrorist activities and armed conflict  including as a result of the disruption of operations of our subsidiaries and our customers  suppliers  distributors  couriers  collaborative partners  licensees and clinical trial sites 
if we are unable to successfully compete in the highly competitive healthcare industry  our business could be harmed 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  and the competition is expected to increase 
competitors include large pharmaceutical  chemical and blood testing companies  compounding pharmacies  and biotechnology companies 
some of these competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical and blood testing companies  have greater resources than us 
accordingly  even if we are successful in launching a product  we may find that a competitive product dominates the market for any number of reasons  including the possibility that the competitor may have launched its product first  the competitor may have greater access to certain raw materials  the competitor may have more efficient manufacturing processes  the competitor may adapt more quickly to technological change  the competitor may have greater marketing capabilities  the competitive product may have therapeutic or other advantages  or new competitors may enter into markets where we currently have significant competitive advantage 
the technologies applied by our competitors and us are rapidly evolving  and new developments frequently result in price competition and product obsolescence 
in addition  we may be impacted by competition from generic forms of our products  substitute products or imports of products from lower priced markets 
conflicts with or decisions by third parties we collaborate with could harm our business 
an important part of our business strategy depends upon collaborations with third parties  including research collaborations and joint efforts to develop and commercialize new products 
as circumstances change  chiron and our strategic partners may develop conflicting priorities or other conflicts of interest 
we may experience significant delays and incur significant expenses in resolving these conflicts and may not be able to resolve these matters on acceptable terms 
even without conflicts of interest  we may disagree with our strategic partners as to how best to realize the value associated with a current product or a product in development 
in some cases  the strategic partner may have responsibility for formulating and implementing key strategic or operational plans 
in addition  merger and acquisition activity within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may affect our strategic partners  causing them to reprioritize their efforts related to the research collaborations and other joint efforts with us 
decisions by corporate partners on key clinical  regulatory  marketing including pricing  inventory management and other issues may prevent successful commercialization of the product or otherwise impact our profitability 
if any of our third party suppliers or manufacturers cannot adequately meet our needs  our business could be harmed 
we use raw materials and other supplies that generally are available from multiple commercial sources 
certain manufacturing processes  however  use materials that are available from sole sources  or that are in short supply  or are difficult for the supplier to produce and certify in accordance with our specifications 
from time to time  concerns are raised with respect to potential contamination of biological materials that are supplied to us 
these concerns can further tighten market conditions for materials that may be in short supply or available from limited sources 
moreover  regulatory approvals to market our products may be conditioned upon obtaining certain materials from specified sources 
our ability to substitute material from an alternate source may be delayed pending regulatory approval of such alternate source 
although we work to mitigate the risks associated with relying on sole suppliers  there is a possibility that material shortages could impact production 
we purchase bulk powdered tobramycin  the primary basic raw material in tobi tobramycin  from two of the principal worldwide suppliers of the drug 
we anticipate that either one of these suppliers alone will be able to supply sufficient quantities to meet current needs  however  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will be able to meet future demand in a timely and cost effective manner 
as a result  our operations could be adversely affected by an interruption or reduction in the supply of bulk powdered tobramycin 
we have entered into contracts with third parties for the production and packaging of tobi tobramycin 
over time  we can use alternative production and packaging sources 
however  if the contracted third parties become unable to produce or package sufficient quantities of tobi solution due to work stoppages or other factors  our operations could be disrupted until alternative sources are secured 
we have entered into contracts with third parties for the packaging of the pre filled diluent syringe for betaseron interferon beta b 
over time  we can use alternative packaging sources 
however  if the contracted third parties become unable to produce or package sufficient quantities of the pre filled diluent syringe for betaseron interferon beta b due to work stoppages or other factors  our operations could be disrupted until alternative sources are secured 
in connection with the production of our flu vaccine products  we must purchase large quantities of chicken eggs 
for fluvirin vaccine  we purchase those eggs and incubation services from a single supplier in the united kingdom and  pursuant to the contract with that supplier  we have agreed to make specified purchases from that supplier through  subject to our right to terminate this agreement earlier upon payment of a termination fee 
if our supplier were to fail to supply eggs in sufficient quantities or quality  including as a result of any health or other issues related to the chickens  our business would be materially adversely affected 
we are a key provider for the blood screening field of nucleic acid testing and immunodiagnostics 
in nucleic acid testing  we rely on our collaborative partner  gen probe  to manufacture the west nile virus assay  currently in use on an investigational use basis in the us and the procleix hiv hcv and procleix ultrio assays 
we currently source the related instrument system from third party suppliers 
currently  gen probe is the only manufacturer of nucleic acid testing products using transcription mediated amplification technology 
in immunodiagnostics  under the ortho clinical diagnostics  inc contract  we manufacture bulk reagents and antigens and confirmatory test kits sold in the clinical diagnostics and blood screening fields 
while we and our partners work to mitigate the risks associated with being a key provider  there can be no assurance that our partner  gen probe  will be able to provide sufficient quantities of the procleix hiv hcv and procleix ultrio assays or that we will be able to manufacture sufficient bulk reagents and antigens and confirmatory test kits for immunodiagnostic products 
our difficulties or delays or those of our partners could cause a public health concern for the blood supply  as well as increase costs and cause loss of revenue or market share 
if we cannot obtain necessary licenses to third party patents for the manufacture or sale of our products  we may have to withdraw from the market or delay the introduction of the affected product 
third parties  including competitors  have patents and patent applications in the us and other significant markets that may be useful or necessary for the manufacture  use or sale of certain products and products in development by our strategic partners and us 
it is likely that third parties will obtain these patents in the future 
certain of these patents may be broad enough to prevent or delay us and our strategic partners from manufacturing or marketing products important to our current and future business 
we cannot accurately predict the scope  validity and enforceability of these patents  if granted  the extent to which we may wish or need to obtain licenses to these patents  and the cost and availability of these licenses 
if we do not or cannot obtain these licenses  products may be withdrawn from the market or delays could be encountered in market introduction while an attempt is made to design around these patents  or we could find that the development  manufacture or sale of such products is foreclosed 
we could also incur substantial costs in licensing or challenging the validity and scope of these patents 
because most of our products are based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community  they may not be accepted by healthcare providers and patients  which could harm our business 
we may experience difficulties in launching new products  many of which are novel products based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community 
we have no assurance that healthcare providers and patients will accept such products 
in addition  government agencies  as well as private organizations involved in healthcare  from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients 
such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential and may adversely affect the usage of our products directly for example  by recommending a decreased dosage of our product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy or a government entity withdrawing its recommendation to screen blood donations for certain viruses or indirectly for example  by recommending a competitive product over our product 
if we are unable to avoid significant exposure to product liability claims  our business could be harmed 
we are exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects 
while we will continue to take precautions  we may not avoid significant product liability exposure 
although we maintain product liability insurance  there is no guarantee that this coverage will be sufficient 
it is not feasible to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain products and we are self insured in relation to these products 
if we are sued for any injury caused by our products  we could suffer a significant financial loss 
as we are a key provider for the blood screening field of nucleic acid testing and immunodiagnostics  we may have product liability in addition to contract exposure  in the event that our difficulties or delays or those of our partners could cause a public health concern for the blood supply 
our mishandling of hazardous materials could result in substantial costs and harm to our business 
in connection with our research and manufacturing activities  we utilize some hazardous materials 
we believe we take great care to ensure we have appropriate procedures and permits in place for storing and handling such hazardous materials 
we could be subject to loss of our permits  government fines or penalties and or other adverse governmental action if such hazardous materials are stored  handled or released into the environment in violation of law or any permit 
a substantial fine or penalty  the payment of significant environmental remediation costs or the loss of a permit or other authorization to operate or engage in our ordinary course of business could result in material  unanticipated expenses and the possible inability to satisfy customer demand 
our patents may not prevent competition or generate revenues 
we seek to obtain patents on many of our inventions 
without the protection of patents  competitors may be able to use our inventions to manufacture and market competing products without being required to undertake the lengthy and expensive development efforts made by us and without having to pay royalties or otherwise compensate us for the use of the invention 
we have no assurance that patents and patent applications owned or licensed to us will provide substantial protection 
important legal questions remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the us and other important markets 
we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will be granted  or the effective coverage of those that are granted 
in the us and other important markets  the issuance of a patent is neither conclusive as to its validity nor the enforceable scope of its claims 
we have engaged in significant litigation to determine the scope and validity of certain of our patents and expect to continue to do so 
an adverse outcome of litigation could result in the reduction or loss of royalty revenues 
engaging in patent litigation against one party may place significant royalty revenues received or to be received from other parties at risk 
even if we are successful in obtaining and defending patents  there can be no assurance that these patents will provide substantial protection 
the length of time necessary to resolve patent litigation successfully may allow infringers to gain significant market advantage 
third parties may be able to design around the patents and develop competitive products that do not use the inventions covered by our patents 
many countries  including certain countries in europe  have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties for example  the third party s product is needed to meet a threat to public health or safety in that country  or the patent owner has failed to work the invention in that country  or the third party has patented improvements 
in addition  most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors 
in these countries  the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement  which could materially diminish the value of the patent 
in addition  royalty revenues may decline as patents expire 
sales of our products may be adversely affected by the availability and amount of reimbursement to the user of our products from third parties  such as the government and insurance companies 
in the us and other significant markets  sales of our products may be affected by the availability of reimbursement from the government or other third parties  such as insurance companies 
it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel biotechnology products  and current reimbursement policies for existing products may change 
in certain foreign markets  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of pharmaceutical companies 
there have been proposals in the us at both the federal and state level to implement such controls 
if the united states congress enacts legislative proposals addressing parallel importation currently being deliberated  revenues from certain products may be affected by this change in us policy 
the growth of managed care in the us also has placed pressure on the pricing of healthcare products 
these pressures can be expected to continue 
if our efforts to integrate acquired or licensed businesses or technologies into our business are not successful  our business could be harmed 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to continue to grow our business through in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions of products or companies 
the failure to adequately address the financial  operational or legal risks raised by such transactions could harm our business 
financial aspects related to these transactions may alter our financial position  reported operating results or stock price  and include use of cash resources  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  impairment losses or restructuring charges  large write offs and difficulties in assessment of the relative percentages of in process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset  and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets 
operational risks that could harm our existing operations or prevent realization of anticipated benefits from such transactions include challenges associated with managing an increasingly diversified business  difficulties in assimilating the operations  products  technology  information systems or personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of the acquired company  including intellectual property claims  and subsequent loss of key personnel 
legal risks may include requirements to obtain the consent of our stockholders or a third party  or the approval of various regulatory authorities 
if such efforts to integrate acquired or licensed businesses or technologies into our business are not successful  our business could be harmed 
if we cannot initiate and maintain revenue generating relationships with third parties  we may not be able to grow our revenues in the near to medium term 
many products in our current pipeline are in relatively early stages of research or development 
our ability to grow earnings in the near to medium term may depend  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain other revenue generating relationships with third parties  such as licenses to certain of our technologies  and on our ability to identify and successfully acquire rights to later stage products from third parties 
we may fail to establish such other sources of revenue 
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could harm our business 
we have significant cash balances and investments 
our financial results  therefore  are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  we sell products in many countries throughout the world  and our financial results could be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our level of debt could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing  if necessary 
as of december   our total debt including current portion  was million 
our level of debt could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the and the convertible debentures the debentures 
among other things  our level of debt may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and general corporate purposes  require us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt  which will reduce funds available for other business purposes  such as capital expenditures or acquisitions  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we compete  place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less leverage  render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including those relating to the debentures and our other debt obligations 
we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt 
the terms of our credit facility  the indenture governing the debentures and the agreements governing our other debt permit additional borrowings 
our incurrence of additional debt could further exacerbate the risks described above 
our ability to satisfy our obligations under the debentures and our other debt agreements will depend on our future operating performance  which will be subject  in part  to factors beyond our control  including general economic and business conditions 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our debt  including the debentures  obtain additional financing  sell some of our assets or operations  reduce or delay capital expenditures  or revise or delay our strategic plans 
if we are required to take any of these actions  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions  that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments  including the indenture governing the debentures 
our relationship with novartis ag could limit our ability to enter into transactions  pursue opportunities in conflict with novartis and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we have an alliance with novartis ag  a life sciences company headquartered in basel  switzerland 
under a series of agreements between chiron and novartis  and as a result of subsequent stock issuances by chiron  novartis ownership interest in chiron was approximately as of december  the governance agreement between chiron and novartis contains provisions that require the approval of novartis before we enter into certain corporate transactions 
these transactions generally include significant debt or equity issuances  debt or equity repurchases  most mergers and acquisitions  the payment of cash dividends  amendments to chiron s certificate of incorporation or by laws  and other transactions that would adversely impact the rights of novartis  or discriminate against novartis  as a chiron stockholder 
in addition  a majority of the independent directors must approve any material transactions between chiron and novartis 
these provisions may limit our ability to enter into transactions with third parties otherwise viewed as beneficial to chiron 
all of our shares owned by novartis are eligible for sale in the public market subject to compliance with the applicable securities laws 
we have agreed that  upon novartis request  we will file one or more registration statements under the securities act in order to permit novartis to offer and sell shares of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by novartis in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our stock price could be volatile 
the price of our stock  like that of other pharmaceutical companies  is subject to significant volatility 
any number of events  both internal and external to us  may affect our stock price 
these include  without limitation fluctuations in earnings from period to period  results of clinical trials conducted by us or by our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  impact from the recent fluvirin vaccine developments  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with strategic partners  corporate restructuring by us  the sale of a substantial number of shares held by our existing stockholders  licensing activities by us  and the acquisition or sale by us of products  products in development or businesses 
in connection with our research and development collaborations  from time to time we may invest in equity securities of our strategic partners 
the price of these securities also is subject to significant volatility and may be affected by  among other things  the types of events that affect our stock 
changes in the market price of these securities may impact our profitability 
we are subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions and changes to the corporate tax rate and laws of any of these jurisdictions could increase the amount of corporate taxes we have to pay 
we pay taxes principally in the us  germany  italy  the netherlands and the united kingdom 
all of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate tax rates and other tax laws  which could increase our future tax provision 
specifically  on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act includes an elimination of the tax benefit of the extraterritorial income exclusion over and we have negotiated a number of rulings regarding income and other taxes that are subject to periodic review and renewal 
if such rulings are not renewed or are substantially modified  income taxes payable in particular jurisdictions could increase 
while we believe that all material tax liabilities are reflected properly in our balance sheet  we are presently under audit in several jurisdictions and may be subject to further audits in the future  and we have no assurance that we will prevail in all cases in the event the taxing authorities disagree with our interpretations of the tax law 
in addition  we have assumed liabilities for all income taxes incurred prior to the sales of our former subsidiaries  including powderject vaccines  inc  sbl vaccin ab  and powderject research limited 
future levels of research and development spending  capital investment and export sales will impact our entitlement to related tax credits and benefits which have the effect of lowering our effective tax rate 
our earnings results may be inconsistent and cause volatility in our stock price 
our operating results may vary considerably from quarter to quarter 
any number of factors may affect our quarterly operating results 
these factors include  but are not limited to the following inventory management practices  including wholesale ordering patterns  the level of pre clinical and clinical trial related activities  seasonality of certain vaccine products  the tender driven nature of certain vaccine products  the nature of our collaborative  royalty and license arrangements and other revenue sources  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and the level of product reserves due to various issues  including seasonality patterns  excess and obsolete inventory  and production yields 
our results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year 
revisions to accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws could result in changes to our standard practices and could require a significant expenditure of time  attention and resources  especially by senior management 
we must follow accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws set by the governing bodies and lawmakers in the us and other countries where we do business 
from time to time  these governing bodies and lawmakers implement new and revised rules and laws 
these new and revised accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws may require changes to our financial statements  the composition of our board of directors  the composition  the responsibility and manner of operation of various board level committees  the information filed by us with the governing bodies and enforcement of tax laws against us 
implementing changes required by such new standards  requirements or laws likely will require a significant expenditure of time  attention and resources  especially by our senior management 
it is impossible to completely predict the impact  if any  on chiron of future changes to accounting standards  financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws 
it is possible that the application of certain current accounting standards may change due to environmental factors  which may necessitate a change in our standard practice related to these accounting standards 
in particular  effective july  we will be required to adopt sfas no 
r requiring us to apply a fair value based method to account for costs related to share based payments including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we expect the adoption of sfas r to materially impact our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a significant portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in western european countries 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of those countries 
our primary exposures to foreign exchange rates are associated with the value of the euro and the value of the british pound 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar vis vis the euro and or british pound will result in a higher us dollar translated value of our us dollar based revenues and expenses 
similarly  a decrease in the value of the us dollar vis vis the euro and or british pound will result in a higher us dollar translated value of our pound denominated revenue and expenditures 
to mitigate foreign currency exchange risks  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and purchase foreign currency option contracts 
we do not use any of these derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional amount of these derivative financial instruments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of three months or less 
at december   our transaction exposures amounted to million and were offset by foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million fair value of million 
the notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts was million fair value of million at december  based on exposures at december   a movement against our portfolio of transaction exposures and hedge contracts would result in a gain or loss of approximately million 
a movement in the value of the us dollar versus our portfolio of transaction exposures has occurred only once in the last quarters in the second quarter of 
foreign currency gains losses from continuing operations  including the impact of hedging  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our primary anticipated exposures result from non us dollar denominated revenues and expenditures related to our western european operations 
our risk is that the value of the british pound increases ie  we have a short british pound exposure and that the value of the euro decreases ie  we have a long euro exposure 
our short british pound exposure is currently larger than our long euro exposure 
hence  a further decrease in the value of the us dollar vis vis both these currencies will likely have a negative impact on our financial results 
we may selectively hedge anticipated currency exposures by purchasing foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts 
to limit hedging costs  we usually purchase out of the money foreign currency option contracts 
at december   we had no outstanding option contracts 
the notional amount of foreign currency option contracts was million fair value of million at december  based on exposures estimated at december  and based on historical patterns of exchange rate movements  a value at risk analysis estimates that there is a probability that our unhedged portfolio of anticipated currency exposures will result in a loss of million or less over the next months 
in other words  there is a chance that the loss will be greater than million 
we may enter into foreign currency forwards or options to hedge these exposures 
interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates in both our investment portfolio and certain floating rate liabilities and lease commitments where interest rates are tied to the london inter bank offered rate 
our investment portfolio consists of a diversified selection of fixed income securities  including money market funds and instruments  corporate notes and bonds  government agency securities and other debt securities issued by financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our convertible debentures because the debentures bear interest at fixed rates 
our investment portfolio amounted to approximately  million at december  as of that date  we also had million of floating rate obligations tied to the london inter bank offered rate libor 
we had a natural hedge against this exposure as a result of our portfolio holdings in floating rate fixed income securities tied to libor 
the analysis below describes the impact of changes in interest rates to us and is based on a net investment portfolio of million 
the analysis assumes an immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points and examines the impact to us over the next twelve months 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points results in higher interest income of million over the subsequent month period 
similarly  a basis point decrease results in a decrease in reported income of million 
also  an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points results in a decrease in the portfolio market value of million 
fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by changes in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income  and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 
a larger than basis point movement in short term interest rates has occurred once in the last ten years  a basis point movement has occurred once in the last ten years  a basis point movement has occurred in four of the last ten years  and a basis point movement has occurred in four of the last ten years 
equity securities risk we have exposure to equity price risk because of our investments in equity securities 
typically  we obtain these securities through our collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners 
we classify a majority of these securities as available for sale and  consequently  record them on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
we periodically review the carrying values of these securities 
we recognize impairment losses against earnings in the same period the loss was deemed to have occurred 
changes in share prices affect the value of our equity portfolio 
to reduce this risk  we hedge a portion of our exposure through forward sales contracts 
the forward sales contracts substantially offset the value of the securities held and  in effect  neutralize the impact of market valuation shifts on the hedged portfolio 
the notional amount of our forward sales contracts at december  was million versus a fair value of million 
a lower fair value indicates a gain on forward sales contracts since we sold the shares forward at higher prices 
the notional amount of our forward sales contracts at december  was million fair value of million 
in the future  we may use additional hedging strategies in order to mitigate the potential adverse impact from changes in the market value of stock prices 
we have no assurance that impairment losses will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
we recorded charges of million and million in and  respectively  to write down certain available for sale equity securities that we deemed to have been impaired 
there was no such charge in at december   if the market price of our equity investments  including warrants  decreased by  the market value of the equity portfolio would decrease by million 
counterparty risk we manage the risk of counterparty default on our debt securities and derivative financial instruments through the use of credit standards  counterparty diversification and monitoring of counterparty financial condition 
we execute debt securities and derivative financial instrument transactions with financial institutions and other issuers with strong credit ratings  which reduce the risk of loss due to nonpayment or deterioration in credit rating 
in  we recorded a charge of million to write down debt securities with a face value of million due to the decline in the credit rating of the issuer 
on march   the issuer paid us the full principal plus interest  thus offsetting the prior loss 
we have not experienced any realized losses due to counterparty default
