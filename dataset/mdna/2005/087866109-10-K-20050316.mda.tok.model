item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of beverly hills bancorp inc and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
references in this filing to beverly hills bancorp inc  bhbc  the company  we  our  and us refer to beverly hills bancorp inc and our subsidiaries  unless the context indicates otherwise 
results of operations compared to through april   beverly hills bancorp inc  then known as wilshire financial services group inc  conducted operations in three principal business segments community banking operations referred to herein as our banking operations through our wholly owned subsidiary  first bank of beverly hills  fsb fbbh or the bank  specialized mortgage loan servicing operations through wilshire credit corporation wcc  and mortgage investment operations through wfc inc wfc  then known as wilshire funding corporation 
sale of wilshire credit corporation on april   we completed the sale of wcc  our wholly owned loan servicing subsidiary  to merrill lynch mortgage capital inc merrill lynch  a division of merrill lynch co  new york  ny  for net proceeds of million  and realized a gain on the sale of million before taxes 
subsequent to the sale of wcc  we have operated primarily as a unitary bank holding company 
consequently  our business strategy is focused on the growth and profitability of our banking subsidiary  fbbh  through originations and purchases of commercial real estate and multi family mortgage loans and investments in primarily aaa rated and government sponsored enterprise gse mortgage backed securities 
the bank has filed an application with the california department of financial institutions cdfi for conversion to a state commercial bank charter 
management believes that a cdfi charter would be better aligned with the bank s strategic business plan  by providing fbbh with greater flexibility in its operations and increased opportunities for growth 
critical accounting policies and estimates the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including  but not limited to  those related to allowances for loan losses  other than temporary impairment in the market values of investment securities and other assets  the realizability of deferred tax assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements mortgage backed and other investment securities available for sale 
the company s mortgage backed and other investment securities available for sale are reported at their current fair market value 
in determining current fair value when quotes from third parties are not available  we estimate the present value of the anticipated cash flows of the securities based on certain assumptions  including the amount and timing of future repayments  the discount rate to be used  and default rates and expected losses on the loans underlying the securities 
if the change in market value is considered temporary  the unrealized holding gains and losses are 
table of contents reported net of tax  when applicable  as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
in the event of a decline in market value  management must evaluate whether the decline is temporary in nature or other than temporary 
in making this evaluation  management must consider certain factors  including a whether the company has the ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of the fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment  and b whether evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
declines that are considered other than temporary are reflected as market valuation losses and impairments in the consolidated statements of operations and not as a direct reduction to stockholders equity 
the company s portfolio of mortgage backed and other investment securities available for sale has increased significantly over the past three years and  as of december   represented approximately of consolidated total assets 
consequently  fluctuations in the securities values can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolios 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged against operations  recoveries of previously charged off loans  and allocations of discounts on purchased loans  and is decreased by loan charge offs 
loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
the company uses its internal asset review system to evaluate its loan portfolio and to classify loans as pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
these terms correspond to varying degrees of risk that the loans will not be collected in part or in full 
the frequency at which a specific loan is subjected to internal asset review depends on the type and size of the loan and the presence or absence of other risk factors  such as delinquency and changes in collateral values 
the allowance for loan losses includes specific valuation allowances svas established for impaired loans and general valuation allowances gvas 
svas are in most cases equal to the excess of the unpaid principal balance over the fair value of the collateral for all impaired loans 
gvas are based on qualitative and quantitative factors that are updated each quarter 
the qualitative factors are subject to management s evaluation after consideration of certain credit risk characteristics 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the institution s historical and recent loss experience in its portfolios  the volume  severity and trend of non performing assets  the extent to which refinances or loan modifications are made to maintain loans in a current status  known deterioration in credit concentrations or certain classes of loans  loan to value ratios of real estate secured loans  risks associated with specific types of collateral  the quality and effectiveness of the lending policy  loan purchase policy  internal asset review policy  charge off  collection and recovery policies  current and anticipated conditions in the general and local economies which might affect the collectability of the institution s asset  anticipated changes in the composition or volume of the loan portfolio  and reasonableness standards in accordance with regulatory agency policies 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
management currently intends to maintain an unallocated allowance in the range of to of the total estimated allowance for loan losses  due to the inherent risk associated with the imprecision in estimating the allowance 
to assess the adequacy of the bank s allowance for loan losses  the portfolio is segmented into three components impaired loans  homogeneous loans  and non homogeneous loans 
impaired loans have been defined as all loan types classified either substandard  doubtful  or loss including loans which may have been upgraded but which are troubled debt restructurings 
svas are measured on a loan by loan basis utilizing either the discounted cash flow or fair market value approaches  as defined under the accounting standards for impaired loans 
homogeneous loans have been defined as loans secured by one to four single family residences  mobile home loans  and consumer loans  and are analyzed by their respective loan group 
gva loss estimates are measured utilizing peer benchmark factors for homogeneous pools 

table of contents non homogeneous loans include the following loan types multifamily  commercial real estate  bridge loans  construction loans  and commercial unsecured 
the non homogeneous loans are analyzed individually 
gva loss estimates are developed and based upon risk rating utilizing migration analysis  which considers the impact of losses on a loan by loan basis 
a loss horizon of four years has been developed with the objective of achieving loss data to capture a full business cycle 
when the bank increases the allowance for loan losses related to loans  it records a corresponding increase to the provision for loan losses in the statement of operations 
the ots  as part of its examination process  periodically reviews the bank s allowances for losses and the carrying values of its assets 
there can be no assurance that the ots will not require additional reserves following future examinations 
when our mortgage investment operations acquire pools of discounted loans  we record an increase to the allowance for loan losses by allocating a portion of the purchase discount deemed to be associated with measurable credit risk 
amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses from purchase discounts did not increase the provision for loan losses recorded in the statement of operations  rather they decreased the amounts of the purchase discounts that are accreted into the interest income over the lives of the loans 
if  after the initial allocation of the purchase discount to the allowance for loan losses  management subsequently identifies the need for additional allowances against discounted loans  the additional allowances are established through charges to the provision for loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the portfolio  previous loan loss experience  current economic conditions  volume  growth  and composition of the portfolio and other relevant factors 
actual losses may differ from management s estimates 
income taxes 
at december  we had a total deferred tax asset of million 
this asset represents the tax effect of future deductible or taxable amounts and is attributable to net operating loss carryforwards and also to temporary differences between amounts that have been recognized in the financial statements and amounts that have been recognized in the company s income tax returns 
in accounting for the deferred tax asset  we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires  among other things  that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   we evaluated the positive and negative evidence regarding the future realization of the deferred tax assets 
pursuant to this evaluation  we concluded that the available objective positive evidence regarding our ability to generate future federal taxable income substantially outweighed the available objective negative evidence regarding future federal taxable income 
we also concluded that the objective negative evidence regarding the ability to generate certain future state taxable income outweighed the available objective positive evidence regarding certain future state taxable income  due primarily to the curtailment of our operations in the state of oregon subsequent to the sale of wcc 
as a result  we believe it is more likely than not that a substantial amount of our deferred tax assets will be realized in future years  and consequently  we believe  as of december   that the only valuation allowance required is approximately million related to net operating loss carryforwards in oregon and certain other states and federal net operating loss carryforwards that may not be utilized prior to expiration 
the net deferred tax asset of million is reported as an asset in our consolidated statement of financial condition as of december  however  there can be no assurance that the amount  if any  that we ultimately realize will not differ materially from our assessment 
as portions of the deferred tax asset are realized and the valuation allowance is reduced  the related benefits  to the extent they relate to our post reorganizational period  are recorded as a deferred tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations 
as benefits relating to our pre reorganizational period are realized  they are recorded as a direct increase to stockholders equity 

table of contents contingencies 
we are party to various legal proceedings  as discussed above and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these matters have a degree of uncertainty associated with them 
we continually assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings  the amounts of any related ongoing costs  and the adequacy of amounts provided for these matters 
there also can be no assurance that all matters that may be brought against us or that we may bring against other parties are known to us at any point in time 
consolidated results our consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  as a result of the sale of wcc  we have presented wcc s operating results under the caption discontinued operations  separate and apart from income from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for each year presented 
our income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our income before taxes from continuing operations was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  management believes that pre tax income represents a more meaningful measure of our financial results than after tax net income  as substantially all of the reported income tax expense will not be due and payable as a result of the utilization of our net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and an additional deduction for the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
our consolidated stockholders equity increased by million during the year ended december  to million  or book value per diluted share 
much of this increase related to certain tax benefits that were realized during the year  as discussed in further detail below 
in addition  the increase reflects our net income for the year including the gain on the sale of wcc and the issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options  partially offset by million in cash dividends on our common stock and net after tax unrealized losses of million on our portfolio of available for sale securities and hedging instruments 
the company realized significant tax benefits in which directly impacted stockholders equity 
as discussed earlier  we determined as of december  that it was more likely than not that we would realize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in future years 
consequently  we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance applicable to our consolidated deferred tax asset of million 
since these deferred tax benefits relate to losses generated prior to our reorganization  their recognition was recorded as a direct increase to stockholders equity  and not as a reduction to income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  the increase in stockholders equity reflects a million tax benefit from the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
the increase in income from continuing operations in as compared with was due primarily to the following factors consolidated net interest income increased by million  reflecting significant lending and investment activity  as well as a higher net interest margin and spread  at our banking subsidiary  fbbh  consolidated other income increased by million  due primarily to the absence of loan servicing expenses and market impairment charges in  and consolidated operating expenses declined by million  primarily as a result of a million decrease in our legal costs for the defense of former executives  partially offset by million in auditing and consulting expenses related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley section these above factors were partially offset by a loan loss provision of million in  as compared with loan loss recaptures of million in 
table of contents interest income a significant portion of our consolidated earnings arises from net interest income  which is the difference between interest income received and interest expense paid 
net interest income is affected by the relative amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the percentage of discounted loans included in the portfolio and the timing of receipt or accretion of purchase discount 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding the total amount of the company s income from interest earning assets and the resulting average yields  the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  expressed in dollars and rates  and the net interest spread and net interest margin 
the interest income and expense amounts in the table below are consolidated  but reflect primarily the results of our banking operations 
information is based on monthly balances during the indicated periods

net interest spread represents average yield on interest earning assets minus average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by total average interest earning assets 

table of contents the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior volume and iii total change in rate and volume

upon such a determination  those loans are placed on non accrual status and deemed to be non performing 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed by a charge to interest income 
interest income on loans includes loan fees of and  respectively  for the years ended december  and 
table of contents the bank s net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the net interest spread increased by basis points  from in to in  and the net interest margin increased from to for the same periods 
the increase in net interest income in was primarily attributable to the bank s significant loan originations and purchases of investment securities in and in late  utilizing new deposits and low cost borrowings as funding sources 
in addition  the prevailing low interest rate environment has continued to impact the bank s interest bearing liabilities to a greater extent than its interest earning assets  as indicated by the higher spreads and margins in the bank s overall cost of funds declined by basis points  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in contrast  the bank s average yield on its interest earning assets declined by only basis points  from for to for the bank s interest income on mortgage backed and other investment securities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in was due to an increase in the average investment balance  primarily as a result of the bank s purchases of million of mortgage backed and other investment securities in  in addition to significant purchases in the latter half of as a result of the recent rise in market interest rates  the bank s yield for increased by one basis point over the yield for the recent slight increases in market rates of interest also have resulted in a slowing of the prepayment rates on these securities in as compared with the bank s interest income on loans was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a million increase in the average loan balance in  which resulted from both higher loan originations and a slowing of prepayments as compared with the prior year 
the bank s originations and purchases totaled million in  compared with million in  and its loan repayments declined by nearly million in despite the larger portfolio 
this increase in average loan volume was partially offset by a basis point decline in average yield  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  fbbh s interest expense on deposits totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in resulted from a significant increase in the average deposit balance  as the bank raised new brokered certificates of deposit in late and early to finance its loan originations and purchases 
the bank has since permitted the run off of its certificates of deposit and has utilized short term borrowings and fhlb advances to finance its asset acquisitions 
the higher average deposit volume in was largely offset by a decline in cost of basis points  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the bank s interest expense on borrowings for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a significant increase in the average balance of outstanding borrowings 
beginning in the second quarter of  the bank  after receiving a deposit of million from bhbc representing primarily the gross proceeds from the sale of wcc  increasingly utilized advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb and repurchase agreements as its primary funding source in lieu of higher costing certificates of deposit 
in august  the fhlb raised the bank s authorized borrowing limit from to of the bank s total assets as of the previous quarter end 
these increases in the average borrowing balance were partially offset by a decline in the cost of borrowings of basis points  from for to for provision for loan losses provisions for losses on loans are charged to operations to maintain an allowance for losses on the loan portfolio at a level which the bank believes is adequate based on an evaluation of the inherent risks in the portfolio 
the bank s evaluation is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  current economic conditions and trends  collateral values  and other relevant factors 

table of contents based on its quarterly evaluations of the adequacy of its loan loss reserves  the bank recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the bank recaptured million of loan loss reserves  primarily as a result of the sale of its performing mobile home loan portfolio in june the credit quality of our assets is affected by many factors beyond our control  including local and national economic conditions  and the possible existence of facts which are not known to us which adversely affect the likelihood of repayment of various loans in our loan portfolio and realization of the collateral upon a default 
accordingly  we can give no assurance that we will not sustain loan losses materially in excess of the allowance for loan losses 
realized gains on sales the bank realized gains totaling million on sales of million of mortgage backed and other investment securities in for the year ended december   the bank s realized gains totaled million on sales of million of mortgage backed securities 
net gains on sales of securities are generated primarily in declining interest rate environments 
accordingly  gains or losses from sales of securities may fluctuate significantly from period to period  and the results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be attained in future periods 
other income the bank s other income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the transfer of the servicing duties on the bank s loan portfolio from wcc to the bank beginning january  as a result  the bank no longer pays a fee to wcc for servicing a majority of its loan portfolio 
compensation and employee benefits expense the bank s compensation and employee benefits expense totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in reflects an increase in incentive compensation  primarily as a result of the high level of loan fundings in as compared with the prior year 
other expenses the bank s other expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in was largely due to the accrual of million of settlement costs in december in connection with litigation related to the bank s sale of its bankcard operations in june the bank s audit expenses declined by million in as a result of the allocation of costs related to sarbanes oxley section to the holding company 
in addition  depreciation expense declined by million  as many of the bank s leasehold improvements became fully depreciated as of august   when the original lease at its calabasas  california offices expired 
these decreases were partially offset by slight increases in other expense categories 
the bank incurred higher professional fees in as a result of consulting fees incurred in its conversion to an in house loan servicing system 
in addition  the bank s legal expenses increased by million  due primarily to litigation costs associated with the bankruptcy of commercial loan corporation see item legal proceedings 
in most other expense categories  costs remained consistent from to  reflecting the bank s efforts to control overhead

since the swap qualified for cash flow hedging for accounting purposes  that amount was shown  net of taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income as an unrealized loss 
regulatory capital requirements federally insured savings associations such as fbbh are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
those standards generally are as stringent as the comparable capital requirements imposed on national banks 
the ots has indicated that the capital level of fbbh exceeds the minimum requirement for well capitalized status under provisions of the prompt corrective action regulation

at december   the bank had million of certificates of deposit 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the months ending december  and thereafter amounted to million and million  respectively 
wholesale deposits generally are more responsive to changes in interest rates than core deposits  and thus are more likely to be withdrawn by the investor upon maturity as changes in interest rates and other factors are perceived by investors to make other investments more attractive 
bank management continues its effort to reduce the bank s exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing funding sources whose repricing characteristics more closely match those of the bank s interest earning assets

the increase results in part from our net income for the year and the issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options 
in addition  we recorded significant tax benefits in  primarily through a reduction in the valuation allowance applicable to our deferred tax asset which  in turn  resulted in a net increase in stockholders equity of approximately million 
since these tax benefits relate to losses generated prior to our reorganization  their recognition was recorded as a direct increase to stockholders equity  and not as a reduction to income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
these increases in equity were partially offset by a million decline in after tax unrealized gains on our portfolio of available for sale securities and hedging instruments 

table of contents the increase in our income from continuing operations from to was primarily attributable to the following factors we recorded a net recapture of million of loan loss reserves in  versus incurring a loan loss provision of million for the year ended december   for a net improvement of million 
the results for included approximately million in legal fees and expenses related to the settlement of litigation which arose from events prior to our june restructuring 
we believe that the settlement agreement has eliminated most of our future costs arising from the financial collapse of capital consultants llc ccl  but we continue to incur expenses on behalf of a former officer in connection with the above described litigation 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of such costs for former officers  compared with approximately million for the year ended december  the results for included million in impairment write downs related to two interest only mortgage backed securities i os at fbbh  with no such charges in subsequent to recording the impairment write downs  the bank sold the i os in the third and fourth quarters of for a net realized gain of million

realized gains on sales of loans and investment securities declined by a total of approximately million as a result of reduced sales activity in holding company expenses for included increases in our defense costs of former management and interest expense on trust preferred debentures  which together increased expenses by approximately million 
following is a discussion of the operating results and liquidity of the company s three business segments our banking operations  loan servicing operations  and mortgage investment operations

table of contents net interest income the following table sets forth information regarding the bank s income from interest earning assets and expenses from interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate interest earning assets federal funds and short term investments mortgage backed and other securities loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities net interest income net interest spread net interest margin the bank s net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the net interest spread increased by basis points  from in to in  and the net interest margin increased from to for the same periods 
the increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to the bank s significant loan origination activity in  utilizing new low cost borrowings as funding sources 
the bank s total average interest earning assets increased by million for  or approximately million more than the increase in its average interest bearing liabilities 
this net improvement in earning asset volume helped mitigate the effects of declining interest rates 
as a result  the decrease in the bank s interest income of million was less than the million decrease in its interest expense  contributing to the nearly million increase in net interest income 
the continuing low interest rate environment has impacted the bank s interest bearing liabilities to a slightly greater extent than its interest earning assets 
for the year ended december   the overall yield on the bank s average interest earning assets was  a decline of basis points from the average yield for however  this drop in yield was exceeded by an basis point decline  from to  in the bank s cost of interest bearing liabilities  resulting in the higher net interest spread in the bank s interest income on mortgage backed and other investment securities was million in  compared with million for this decrease was due to a basis point drop in average yield  from in to in partially offsetting the effects of the lower yield was a million increase in the average asset balance for utilizing new debt facilities  the bank purchased approximately million in aaa rated mortgage backed and other investment securities in  including million in the third and fourth quarters 
the bank s interest income on loans for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to a decline in the average yield on loans of basis points  from for to for  as a result of the continuing decline in interest rates 
however  this decline in yield was partially offset by a million increase in the average portfolio balance 
the bank originated and purchased a total of million in new loans in  including approximately million in the third and fourth quarters  resulting in a higher average earning volume despite continuing significant principal repayments 

table of contents fbbh s interest expense on deposits decreased by approximately million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this decrease was the result of declines in both the average balance and average rates paid in versus the bank raised significant amounts of wholesale certificates of deposit in prior years to fund certain loan acquisitions  but later permitted the run off of the higher rate cds and utilized lower costing debt facilities as its primary funding source 
as a result  the average balance of deposits decreased by million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the average rate paid on the bank s deposits decreased by basis points from to the bank s interest expense on borrowings for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared with approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in was due to a basis point decline in the average cost  from in to in  reflecting the continuing declining interest rate environment 
the lower average cost in was partially offset by the higher average borrowing balance  as the bank obtained additional fhlb advances to finance its earning asset acquisitions 
recapture of loan losses provisions for losses on loans are charged to operations to maintain an allowance for losses on the loan portfolio at a level which the bank believes is adequate based on an evaluation of the inherent risks in the portfolio 
the bank s evaluation is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  current economic conditions and trends  collateral values  and other relevant factors 
based on its quarterly evaluations of the adequacy of its loan loss reserves  the bank did not record a provision for loan losses in or in the second quarter of  the bank recaptured million of loan loss reserves  primarily as a result of the sale of its performing mobile home loan portfolio 
realized gains losses for the year ended december   the bank realized gains totaling approximately million on sales of million of gse mortgage backed securities 
the bank incurred approximately million in net losses on its investment securities for the year ended december  these losses were due to write downs in market value totaling million related to three interest only mortgage backed securities i os  partially offset by approximately million in net realized gains on sales of mortgage backed and treasury securities 
the bank purchased a total of million in i os in as a hedge against possible interest rate increases 
however  as rates continued to decline  the value of the i os was adversely affected 
since this decline in market value was deemed to be other than temporary  the write downs were reflected as market valuation losses and impairments in the accompanying statements of operations  and not as a reduction to stockholders equity 
the bank sold the i os in the third and fourth quarters of for a net realized gain of approximately million 
compensation and employee benefits expense the bank s compensation and benefits totaled approximately million for  compared with million for the increase was due to an increase in the bank s employee head count from to  primarily as a result of the expansion of its commercial lending operations 
other expenses the bank s other expenses totaled approximately million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the accrual of million for the settlement of litigation related to the bank s sale of its bankcard operations in 
table of contents see item legal proceedings 
in addition  the bank incurred higher legal expenses in associated with this litigation 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in other expense categories 
the bank s occupancy expenses declined from the prior year due to the sublease of excess office space after the sale of its bankcard division  and data processing expenses have dropped as a result of the bank s efforts to control overhead 
in addition  depreciation expense has declined as certain equipment and leasehold improvements have become fully depreciated 
the bank did not record any impairment of its goodwill for the years ended december  or  pursuant to its test on march of both years 
off balance sheet arrangements the bank is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
at december  and  the bank had outstanding commitments to extend credit of approximately million and million  respectively 
the bank also had unfunded commitments under lines of credit of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these commitments expose the bank to credit risk in excess of amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the bank receives collateral to support loans and commitments to extend credit for which collateral is deemed necessary 
swap agreement in the bank entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed the interest rate paid on million  as of december  and  of borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements 
under this agreement  the bank received a floating rate of interest and paid a fixed rate of interest 
the fair value of the swap as of december  and was unfavorable by thousand and thousand  respectively 
the swap qualifies for cash flow hedging for accounting purposes  and therefore  these amounts are shown  net of taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized losses 
the swap matured in december regulatory capital requirements federally insured savings associations such as fbbh are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
those standards generally are as stringent as the comparable capital requirements imposed on national banks 
the ots has indicated that the capital level of fbbh exceeds the minimum requirement for well capitalized status under provisions of the prompt corrective action regulation

in addition  in  wfc recorded approximately million in additional loan interest income on the recovery of discounts and reserves on loans which terminated during that period 
wfc s interest on mortgage backed securities declined by approximately million from to  due to the runoff of wfc s mbs portfolio as a result of prepayments on the loans underlying the securities 
wfc records the receipt of such payments directly to interest income  as its portfolio of securities has been written down to an amortized cost of zero 
wfc s interest expense decreased by approximately million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this decrease resulted from wfc s repayments of debt facilities in june with the proceeds from the loan sale described above and also from the continuing decline in interest rates 
realized losses gains wfc s realized losses for the year ended december  reflect impairment charges taken on certain investments and a loss on a sale of loans 
for the year ended december   wfc realized a gain from the sale of approximately million unpaid principal balance of loans in june since the loans sold were originally acquired with a co investor  one half of the gain on sale was shared with the co investor and included in investor participation interest as discussed below

other expenses wfc s other operating expenses decreased by approximately million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decline in depreciation expense in  as a result of the transfer of certain fixed assets from wfc to the company s other business segments 
holding company and miscellaneous operations our holding company and miscellaneous operations consist primarily of other operating revenues and expenses not directly attributable to our banking  mortgage investment or loan servicing operations  and also include eliminations of intercompany accounts and transactions 
primary sources of liquidity include funds available from the company s wholly owned non bank subsidiaries  proceeds from the july issuance of junior subordinated debt  and payments received from fbbh pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the company and the bank 
however  the ots has limited the amount of these payments to the lesser of the bank s stand alone tax liability and the total tax payments made by the company 
in january the bank remitted million to the company for a portion of its liability  and in october the bank remitted million for its liability under the foregoing formula 
discontinued operations loan servicing the company conducted its loan servicing operations through wcc  our servicing subsidiary which was formed pursuant to our june  reorganization 
as discussed earlier  in april the company completed the sale of wcc to merrill lynch 
consequently  wcc s results of operations have been removed from the company s results from continuing operations on the consolidated statements of operations  and have been presented separately in a single caption as income from discontinued operations for all periods presented

through new contractual agreements and servicing rights acquisitions  wcc increased its portfolio of serviced loans by approximately billion in  despite significant loan principal repayments precipitated by the continuing low interest rate environment 
as a result of this growth  wcc s total servicing revenues and ancillary fees including late charges increased by approximately from to the increase in wcc s servicing income in also reflects an adjustment of million  which was recorded in september this adjustment represents the reimbursement of deposits of interest made by wcc for prepaid serviced loans in excess of the amount actually owed by wcc 
wcc had previously deposited these funds into custodial accounts in compliance with the related servicing agreements 
however  the terms of the 
table of contents servicing agreements were subsequently clarified and retroactively applied  resulting in wcc s recovery of these excess funds 
the adjustment is reflected as a reduction to prepayment interest shortfall expense in the above table for the year ended december  net servicing income was negatively impacted by the prevailing low interest rate environment  which triggered extremely rapid prepayments of loans comprising wcc s serviced asset base 
these accelerated prepayments resulted in significant amortization expense on purchased mortgage servicing rights pmsrs over the past three years though the increases from to shown above are attributable also to the larger portfolio volume 
in addition  as a result of the continuing low interest rates  float income earned on deposit balances declined from to the following table sets forth the composition of loans serviced by wcc by type of loan at the dates indicated

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk managing risk is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company 
the most prominent risk exposures are credit quality  interest rate sensitivity  and liquidity 
credit quality risk is the risk of not collecting interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as the result of changes in interest rates 
rate movements can affect the repricing of assets and liabilities differently  as well as their market value 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  investors and borrowers 
asset and liability management it is our objective to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to limit our exposure to earnings volatility and variations in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates change over time 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset and liability committee alco which reviews  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses including those attributable to hedging transactions  purchase activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
alco establishes rate sensitivity tolerances within regulatory guidelines which are approved by the board of directors  and coordinates with the board with respect to overall asset and liability composition 
alco is authorized to utilize off balance sheet financial techniques to assist in the management of interest rate risk 
these techniques include interest rate swap agreements  pursuant to which the parties exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest payments on a specified principal amount referred to as the notional amount for a specified period without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
in december the bank entered into a million notional principal amount interest rate swap agreement 
in accordance with the agreement  the bank paid interest quarterly at a fixed rate of and received quarterly interest payments at the three month libor rate 
the swap agreement matured in december we continually monitor the interest rate sensitivity of our portfolios of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in conjunction with the current interest rate environment 
when a new pool of loans  securities or mortgage servicing rights is acquired  we will assess the incremental change in our sensitivity to interest rates  and determine accordingly whether or not to hedge 

table of contents in addition  as required by ots regulations  alco also regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
alco further evaluates such impacts against the maximum tolerable change in interest income that is authorized by the board of directors 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in the company s net portfolio value at december   should interest rates increase or decrease by to basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value net portfolio value npv as of assets amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands change in rates bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp in determining net portfolio value  management relies upon various assumptions  including  but not limited to  prepayment speeds on the company s assets and the discount rates to be used 
we review our assumptions regularly and adjust them when it is deemed appropriate based on current and future expected market conditions 
management believes that the assumptions including prepayment assumptions it uses to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable 
however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on npv could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 

table of contents another tool used to identify and manage our interest rate risk profile is the static gap analysis 
interest sensitivity gap analysis measures the difference between the assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time periods 
the following table summarizes the anticipated maturities or repricing of the bank s assets and liabilities based on their contractual terms as of december  within twelve months more than one year to three years more than three years to five years over five years total dollars in thousands assets cash and due from banks mortgage backed and other investment securities single family residential loans multi family residential loans commercial real estate loans consumer and other loans other assets total assets liabilities demand deposits now and money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit repurchase agreements fhlb advances other liabilities total liabilities deficiency excess of assets over liabilities cumulative deficiency excess cumulative deficiency excess as a percent of total assets includes unamortized premium on loans and allowance for loan losses
