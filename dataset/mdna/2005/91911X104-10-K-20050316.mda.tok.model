item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global  research based specialty pharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products 
we focus our greatest resources and attention principally on ten global brands in the therapeutic areas of neurology  infectious disease and dermatology 
our products are currently sold in more than markets around the world  with our primary focus on ten key geographic regions the united states  canada  mexico  the united kingdom  france  italy  poland  germany  spain and china 
our two primary value drivers are a specialty pharmaceutical business with a global platform  and a research and development infrastructure with strong discovery  clinical development and regulatory capabilities 
we believe that our global reach and fully integrated research and development capability make us unique among specialty pharmaceutical companies  and provide us with the ability to take compounds from discovery through the clinical stage and commercialize them in major markets around the world 
in addition  we receive royalties from the sale of ribavirin by schering plough and roche  although such royalties represent a much smaller contribution to our revenues than they have in the past 
in its discussion of the material changes in our financial condition and results of operations between the reporting periods in the consolidated financial statements  management has sought to identify and  in some cases  quantify  the factors that contributed to such material changes 
however  quantifying these factors may involve the presentation of numerical measures that exclude amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
management uses this information to assess material changes in our financial condition and results of operations and is providing it to assist investors and potential investors to understand these assessments 
in each instance  such information is presented immediately following and in connection with an explanation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap  and includes other material information necessary to reconcile the information with the comparable gaap financial measure 
specialty pharmaceuticals specialty pharmaceutical product sales accounted for and of our total revenues from continuing operations for the years ended december  and  respectively  and increased  in the year ended december  compared to the similar period in the increase in specialty pharmaceutical product sales was due to approximately a increase in volume  a increase due to changes in selling prices and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our specialty pharmaceutical business focuses its efforts on ten global brands in our three therapeutic areas 
seven of these global brands are currently being marketed 
our future growth is expected to be driven primarily by growth of our existing products  the commercialization of new products and business development 
our seven global brands accounted for and of our specialty pharmaceutical product sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales of our global brands increased  in the year ended december  compared to the similar period in we have experienced generic challenges and other competition to our products  as well as pricing challenges through government imposed price controls and reductions  and expect these challenges to continue in and beyond 
research and development we seek to discover  develop and commercialize innovative products for the treatment of significant unmet medical needs  principally in the areas of infectious diseases and cancer 
our research and development activities are based upon accumulated expertise developed through over years of research focused on the internal generation of novel molecules 
these efforts led to the discovery and development of ribavirin  an antiviral drug that schering plough and roche market under separate licenses from us  and which is the source of our royalty income 

table of contents we are also developing a pipeline of product candidates  including three clinical stage programs  viramidine  pradefovir formerly called remofovir and retigabine  which target large market opportunities 
viramidine is a pro drug of ribavirin  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c in treatment naive patients in conjunction with a pegylated interferon 
we are developing pradefovir as an oral once a day monotherapy for patients with chronic hepatitis b infection 
with the acquisition of xcel pharmaceutical  inc xcel in march of  another product candidate  retigabine  has been added to our pipeline 
retigabine is being developed as an adjunctive treatment for partial on set seizures in patients with epilepsy 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in ribavirin royalties ribavirin royalty revenues decreased  and accounted for of our total revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  as compared to in the decline in ribavirin royalty revenues  and the decreasing contribution of royalties to our revenues  had been expected with the entry of generic ribavirin in the united states 
we expect ribavirin royalties to be somewhat stable for several years since generics are unlikely to enter the major european countries and japanese markets due to certain protections in those markets through and  respectively  and would expect to see declines as a result of alternative therapies such as viramidine when and if approved 
company strategy we have undergone significant changes in our leadership  strategic direction and operations since in an effort to drive change  our stockholders elected new directors at our annual meetings in and  resulting in a new board composition and the appointment of a new senior management team 
a three part plan was initiated to restructure our company  transform the business and grow through innovation 
we have made significant progress in the execution of this plan  including completion of our restructuring phase that entailed a divestiture program  the restructuring of the management team  the implementation of strong governance protocols and the strengthening of our research and development capability 
the key elements of our strategy include the following targeted growth of existing products 
we focus our business on ten key geographic regions  across three core therapeutic areas and ten global brands 
we believe that our core therapeutic areas are positioned for further growth and that it is possible for a mid sized company to attain a leadership position within these categories 
furthermore  we believe that our global brands have the potential for further worldwide penetration and above industry average growth rates 
in addition  we intend to continue to market and sell  and selectively pursue life cycle management strategies for  our regional and local brands 
efficient manufacturing and supply chain organization 
under our global manufacturing strategy announced in october  we plan to reduce the number of manufacturing facilities from to five by  in order to increase capacity utilization and improve efficiencies 
we have also undertaken a major process improvement initiative  affecting all phases of our operations  from raw material and supply logistics  to manufacturing  warehousing and distribution 
we have made significant progress towards our plans of disposing of certain manufacturing sites and are currently actively marketing the sites to prospective buyers 
the sites were tested for impairment  resulting in impairment of asset value on three of the sites 
accordingly  we wrote these sites down to their fair value and recorded an impairment charge of  for the year ended december  in addition  to the impairment charge  we recorded  in restructuring and impairment charges related to severance for the year ended december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the manufacturing restructuring plan 
development of new products via internal research and development activities 
we seek to discover  develop and commercialize innovative products for the treatment of significant unmet medical needs  principally in the areas of infectious disease and cancer 
we intend to combine our scientific 
table of contents expertise with advanced drug screening techniques in order to discover and develop new product candidates 
product acquisitions 
we plan to selectively license or acquire product candidates  technologies and businesses from third parties which complement our existing business and provide for effective life cycle management of key products 
we believe that our drug development expertise may allow us to recognize licensing opportunities and to capitalize on research initially conducted and funded by others 
during  we acquired the rights to three products indicated for the treatment of parkinson s disease 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these acquisitions 
results of operations we have four reportable specialty pharmaceutical segments comprising our pharmaceuticals operations in north america  latin america  europe and asia  africa and australia 
in addition  we have a research and development division 
certain financial information for our business segments is set forth below 
this discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document

table of contents in sales of our global brands  which contributed  to the increase in product sales for the year ended december  in addition  favorable foreign currency exchange rates contributed  on a net basis to the increase in overall product sales for the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in the value of the euro over the us dollar 
additionally  the amarin acquisition contributed  to product sales in the year ended december  in our north america pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for  an increase of  
the increase reflects higher sales of efudex of  primarily related to the launch of a gram product and sales of products related to the amarin and tasmar acquisitions of  additionally  the increase in revenues in as compared to partially reflects depressed sales due to the inventory reduction program at our wholesalers in  which was completed in april the increases are partially offset by a decrease in sales of mestinon of  primarily due to generic competition 
in our latin america pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for  an increase of  
the increase was primarily due to price increases and in some cases lower discounts offered to wholesalers in the region aggregating  partially offset by a decrease in the value of currencies in the region as compared to the us dollar of  revenues from bedoyecta  which is our highest revenue product in mexico  were  for  an increase of  as compared to in our europe pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for  an increase of  
the increase in the value of currencies in the region as compared to the us dollar contributed  to the increase in revenues in the region for the year ended december  sales in europe were negatively affected by government imposed price controls primarily in spain  germany and italy  partially offset by an increase in sales in poland and central europe 
in our asia  africa and australia aaa pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for  an increase of  
the increase reflects higher sales of nyal of  and an increase in the value of currencies in the region as compared to the us dollar of  ribavirin royalties ribavirin royalties represent amounts earned under the license and supply agreements with schering plough and roche 
under a license and supply agreement  schering plough licensed all oral forms of ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
we receive royalty fees from roche under a license agreement on sale of roche s version of ribavirin  copegus  for use in combination with interferon alfa or pegylated interferon alfa 
ribavirin royalties from schering plough and roche for the year ended december  were  compared to  for  reflecting a decrease of  
the decrease in ribavirin royalties include the effects of the launch of generic ribavirin in the united states and increasing competition between schering plough and roche 
approval of a generic form of oral ribavirin by the us food and drug administration fda in the united states was announced on april  competition from generic pharmaceutical companies has had  and is expected to continue to have  a material negative impact on our royalty revenue 
with respect to schering plough  royalty rates increase in tiers based on increased sales levels in the united states 
as a result of reduced sales  the likelihood of achieving the maximum effective royalty rate in the united states is diminished 
with respect to roche  under the license agreement  the introduction of generics in any market eliminates the obligation of roche to pay royalties for sales in that market 
upon the entry of generics into the united states on april   roche ceased paying royalties on sales in the united states 
schering plough announced its launch of a generic version of ribavirin 
under the license and supply agreement  schering plough is obligated to pay us royalties for sales of their generic ribavirin 
we rely on a limited amount of financial information provided by schering plough and roche to estimate the amounts due to us under the royalty agreements 
based upon the information provided by schering 
table of contents plough for the fourth quarter of  schering plough s sales of rebetol in the united states were negative 
as a result of the uncertainty with royalties associated with sales of rebetol in the united states  a reserve has been established for the potential impact of returns  however  due to the limited information provided by schering plough  there can be no assurance that such amounts will be adequate to cover additional negative royalty amounts in future periods 
gross profit margin gross profit margin on product sales for the year ended december  was compared to in the increase in gross profit margin is primarily due to an increase in sales in the north america region  which generates higher profit margins  and greater efficiencies in our global manufacturing and supply chain operations  partially offset by an increase in costs related to the manufacturing rationalization plan 
selling expenses selling expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for  an increase of  
as a percent of product sales  selling expenses were for the years ended december  and included in selling expenses for the year ended december  were severance charges of  related to a sales force reduction in europe 
the increase in selling expenses reflects our increased promotional efforts primarily in europe  north america and latin america and includes costs related to new product launches and unified promotional materials and campaigns for our global products 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for  a decrease of  
as a percent of product sales  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were severance charges of  related to workforce reductions in spain and  related to the settlement of a bondholder suit  partially offset by a  insurance refund 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to reduced legal fees 
while steps continue to be taken to more effectively manage legal costs  legal fees can vary from period to period based on the level of activity surrounding outstanding legal challenges 
research and development research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for  an increase of  
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the acceleration of clinical trials for viramidine and pradefovir and costs associated with the completion of safety studies for zelapar 
we completed enrollment of two phase studies for viramidine and a phase study for pradefovir 
it is expected that research and development expenses will increase in compared to as progress continues with the clinical trials of viramidine  pradefovir and retigabine 
acquired in process research and development in the year ended december   we incurred an expense of  associated with ipr d related to the acquisition of amarin that occurred in february in the year ended december   we incurred an expense of  associated with ipr d related to the acquisition of ribapharm 
the amount expensed as ipr d represents our estimate of fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in connection with the xcel acquisition we expect to expense approximately  as ipr d in the first quarter of restructuring and impairment charges in the year ended december   we incurred an expense of  related to the manufacturing and rationalization plan 
we have made significant progress towards our plans of disposing of the manufacturing sites and are actively marketing the sites to prospective buyers 
the sites were reassessed for impairment in the second quarter of because we accelerated our plan of disposing of the sites 
this impairment analysis resulted in impairment of asset value on three of the sites 
accordingly  we wrote these sites down to their fair value and recorded an impairment charge of  for the year ended december  in addition to the impairment charge  we recorded  related to severance for the year ended december  
table of contents amortization amortization expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for  an increase of  
the increase was primarily due to amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of ribapharm  amarin and tasmar of  for the year ended december  additionally  we recorded impairment charges of  during the year ended december   primarily related to products sold in italy for which the patent life was reduced by a decree by the italian government 
other income  net  including translation and exchange other income  net  including translation and exchange was  for the year ended december  compared to  for in the year ended december   translation gains principally consisted of translation and exchange gains in europe  aaa and latin america of  partially offset by translation and exchange losses in north america of  translation and exchange gains are primarily related to us dollar denominated assets and liabilities at our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on early extinguishment of debt for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  related to the repurchase of  and  aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due  respectively 
interest expense and income interest expense increased  during the year ended december  compared to the increase was due to the issuance of  aggregate principal amount of and convertible subordinated notes and  aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of we repurchased all of our convertible subordinated notes due in july  which decreased interest expense in interest income increased  during the year ended december  compared to due primarily to higher cash balances in our interest bearing accounts during those periods 
income taxes our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was a provision of compared to a provision of for our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was affected significantly by an increase of  in the valuation allowance to recognize the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the united states net operating losses and research credits 
it was also affected by pre tax losses resulting from restructuring and impairment charges of  and from a work force reduction in europe of  for which we recorded a minimal tax benefit of  
this minimal tax benefit reflects the uncertainty of the realization of tax benefits in some of the jurisdictions in which these charges were incurred 
additionally  we recorded a tax provision of  related to the settlement of a tax dispute with puerto rico in the year ended december  excluding the effect of these items  the effective tax rate would have been 
the higher effective tax rate in reflects a shift in the mix of taxable income with more income from higher tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate for was affected by pre tax losses resulting from the write off of acquired ipr d expenses in connection with the ribapharm acquisition  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the effect of the acquired ipr d write off  the effective tax rate would have been for the year ended december  a majority of our deferred tax assets represent united states net operating losses and research credits 
a valuation allowance was recorded in the fourth quarter for the entire domestic net deferred tax asset 
the consolidated reporting group in the united states has been operating at a loss in recent quarters due to increased investments in research and development and lower royalties 
several strategies have been pursued that would enable us to utilize the net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
however  during the fourth quarter  we determined that one of the strategies that involved selling certain product rights to an unrelated party did not make economic sense at levels proposed and discontinued the effort 
we believe the tax assets will be realized through the successful commercialization of viramadine  however  there is insufficient objective evidence at this time to recognize these assets for financial reporting purposes 
a minimum of  of future taxable income will need to be generated to realize the net operating losses and tax credits 
strategies that would cause the united states assets to be utilized sooner than without reliance on future operating income are being considered 
the valuation allowance will be reduced in the future if the forecast for future taxable income is realized or other strategies are implemented 
ultimate 
table of contents realization of the benefit of the united states net operating losses and research credits is dependent upon us generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
historically  there have not been significant differences between financial reporting pretax earnings and taxable income 
approximately   of the united states net operating loss carryforwards arose from discontinued operations and the disposition of those operations that occurred during and of the united states losses generated to date   will expire in the remaining  begins to expire in income loss from discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations was a loss of  for the year ended december  compared to income of  for the loss in includes environmental charges of  related to a former operating site of our biomedicals division  for which we retained the liability when we sold this business

sales from our seven global brands increased  for the year ended december  over  with of this increase being attributed to increased sales of mestinon worldwide

the amount of collateral varies monthly depending on the fair value of the underlying swap contracts 
as of december   we have collateral of  included in marketable securities and other assets related to these instruments 
in february  we acquired from amarin corporation  plc amarin plc its united states based subsidiary  amarin pharmaceuticals  inc amarin  and all of its united states product rights  which includes permax and a primary care portfolio with a broad range of indications 
we also acquired in the transaction the rights to zelapar  a late stage candidate for the treatment of parkinson s disease 
the fda issued an approvable letter for zelapar  subject to the completion of two safety studies 
we completed these studies and in late filed the final results of these studies with the fda 
we paid  in cash at the closing for the amarin acquisition 
subsequent to the amarin acquisition  we became aware of a significant amount of dated products in wholesaler channels 
under the terms of the original purchase agreement  amarin plc was responsible for any excess inventory at wholesalers that existed at the date of acquisition 
in september  we entered into an amended purchase agreement with amarin plc  which resolved amarin plc s responsibility with respect to excess inventory at the wholesalers 
under the terms of the amended purchase agreement  we are no longer obligated to pay up to  in milestone payments  but paid an additional  which we expensed as research and development in related to amarin plc s commitment to fund a portion of the zelapar studies 
we remain obligated to make the  milestone payment to the developer of zelapar upon the attainment of specified sales thresholds 
all other terms of the original purchase agreement remain substantially unchanged 
in april  we acquired the worldwide rights  excluding the european union to tasmar from roche 
tasmar is indicated for the treatment of parkinson s disease 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid  in cash  plus future additional royalty amounts

 statement of cash flows  all auction rate securities should be classified as marketable securities and not cash and cash equivalents 
as a result  we reviewed our investments in auction rate securities and concluded that we were in technical non compliance with a covenant in the indenture governing our senior notes 
upon realizing a technical non compliance existed  we liquidated our holdings of auction rate securities at approximately the carrying value and cured the technical non compliance 
on march   we acquired xcel pharmaceuticals  inc  a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of disorders of the central nervous systems for  in cash  plus expenses of approximately  xcel s portfolio consists of four products that are sold within the united states  and a late stage clinical product candidate  retigabine  being developed for commercialization in all major markets

management believes that our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements at least through december   and to provide cash needed to fund acquisitions  capital expenditures and our research and development program 
while we have no current intent to issue additional debt or equity securities  we may seek additional debt financing or issue additional equity securities to finance future acquisitions or for other purposes 
we fund our cash requirements primarily from cash provided by our operating activities 
our sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalent balances and our cash flow from operations 
competition from generic pharmaceutical companies has had and is expected to continue to have a material negative impact on our royalty revenue 
with respect to schering plough  royalty rates increase in tiers based on increased sales levels 
as a result of reduced sales  the likelihood of achieving the maximum effective royalty rate in the united states is diminished 
with respect to roche  under the license agreement  the introduction of generics in any market eliminates the obligation of roche to pay royalties for sales in that market 
upon the entry of generics into the united states on april   roche ceased paying royalties on sales in the united states 
while we have historically paid quarterly cash dividends  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
we currently have no product liability insurance for a majority of our products in the united states 
in connection with the amarin acquisition  we acquired product liability insurance for permax  which coverage we expect to maintain  as a result of this product being subject to settled and pending product liability litigation 
in connection with the xcel transaction  we have maintained their product liability insurance while we evaluate the prospective need for such coverage for xcel products and our existing products 
while  to date  no material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products has been successfully maintained against it  a substantial claim  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial performance 
we maintain clinical trial insurance in major markets in which we conduct clinical trials 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth our obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations senior notes due convertible subordinated notes due convertible subordinated notes due other long term debt interest payments lease obligations notes payable total cash obligations we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing techniques except for operating leases disclosed in the table above 
we have no material commitments for purchases of property  plant and equipment and we expect that for  such expenditures will approximate to million 
products in development we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future  of which a large percentage will be to support the continuing product development programs for viramidine  pradefovir  zelapar and retigabine 
we expect that for  we will spend approximately  on these product development programs 
for viramidine  on january   we announced that we had completed enrollment in viser  as well as an initial analysis of the sustained viral response svr information for our viramidine phase proof of concept study compared to ribavirin 
the results validate the study design by continuing to show that viramidine demonstrates statistical comparable efficacy to ribavirin in svr and a significantly reduced incidence of anemia 
the viramidine phase study  conducted entirely in the united states  consisted of treatment na ve subjects with chronic hepatitis c 
the study was an open label  randomized  active control trial  with patients stratified by genotype only 
the study consisted of four comparable treatment groups viramadine mg bid mg daily  viramidine mg bid mg daily  viramidine mg bid mg daily and ribavirin mg daily all in combination with peginterferon alfa a 
treatment duration was based on genotype  with genotypes two and three receiving weeks of treatment and genotype one receiving weeks of treatment  with a post treatment follow up period of weeks 
the week follow up period is considered the medically therapeutic standard evaluation of efficacy 
the final analyses of all phase data is expected to be presented at the european association for the study of the liver conference in april the phase trial has met its design objective by confirming the selection of the mg bid dose used in the two pivotal phase trials 
our external research and development expenses for viramidine were  for the year ended december  and  from inception through december  for pradefovir  which is being developed for the treatment of hepatitis b  we have completed three phase clinical trials in a total of healthy volunteers 
a week dose ranging phase study in asia and the united states began enrollment in july and completed enrollment in november our external 
table of contents research and development expenses for pradefovir were  for the year ended december  and  including a milestone payment of  from inception through december  we acquired the rights to zelapar  a late stage candidate being developed as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of parkinson s disease  in the amarin acquisition in february in late  we submitted a complete response to an approvable letter from the fda  following the completion of two safety studies 
we received a response to our submission from the fda that requires us to provide them with additional information 
we expect to launch zelapar in our external research and development expenses for zelapar were  for the year ended december  we acquired the rights to retigabine  an adjunctive treatment for partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy  in the acquisition of xcel pharmaceuticals inc on march  for retigabine  we are scheduled to commence phase trials in retigabine is believed to have a unique  dual acting mechanism and has undergone several phase clinical trials in over patients 
foreign operations approximately and of our revenues from continuing operations  which includes royalties  for the years ended december  and  respectively  were generated from operations or earned outside the united states 
all of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad 
see forward looking statements 
inflation and changing prices we experience the effects of inflation through increases in the costs of labor  services and raw materials 
we are subject to price control restriction on our pharmaceutical products in the majority of countries in which we operate 
while we attempt to raise selling prices in anticipation of inflation  we operate in some markets which have price controls that may limit our ability to raise prices in a timely fashion 
future sales and gross profit will be reduced if we are unable to obtain price increases commensurate with the levels of inflation

we are required to adopt sfas no r in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  we are evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
if we retain our current method of valuing and expensing options as previously reported in our pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
 we estimate that pretax compensation expense for fiscal will increase by approximately critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  collectibility of receivables  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales when title and risk of ownership transfers to the customer 
revenues are recorded net of provisions for rebates  discounts and returns  which are established at the time of sale 
allowances for future returns of products sold to our direct and indirect customers  who include wholesalers  retail pharmacies and hospitals  are calculated as a percent of sales based on historical return percentages taking into account additional available information on competitive products and contract changes 
we use third party data to estimate the level of product inventories  expiration dating  and product demand at our major wholesalers 
based upon this information  adjustments are made to the accrual if deemed necessary 
actual results could be materially different from our estimates  resulting in future adjustments to revenue 
for the year ended december   returns received were less than of product sales 
for the year ended december   the provision for sales returns was less than of product sales 
we conduct a review of the current methodology and assess the adequacy of the allowance for returns on a quarterly basis  adjusting for changes in assumptions  historical results and business practices  as necessary 
we earn ribavirin royalties as a result of sales of products by third party licensees  schering plough and roche 
ribavirin royalties are earned at the time the products subject to the royalty are sold by the third party and is reduced by an estimate for discounts and rebates that will be paid in subsequent periods for those products sold during the current period 
we rely on a limited amount of financial information provided by schering plough and roche to estimate the amounts due to us under the royalty agreements 
while we believe the schering plough agreement specifies that we are to be reimbursed based on net sales as determined under an accrual basis  we have recently become aware that schering plough may be calculating reimbursements based on a method under which returns are deducted as incurred rather than on an accrual basis 
based upon the information provided by schering plough for the fourth quarter of  schering plough s sales of rebetol in the united states were negative 
as a result of the uncertainty with royalties 
table of contents associated with sales of rebetol in the united states  a reserve has been established for negative royalties caused by negative sales of rebetol in the united states  however  due to the limited information provided by schering plough  there can be no assurance that such amounts will be adequate to cover additional negative royalty amounts in future periods 
consistent with the agreement  we have hired an accounting firm to audit the royalty calculation 
sales incentive we may offer sales incentives primarily in international markets  where typically no right of return exists except for goods damaged in transit  product recalls or for replacement of existing products due to packaging or labeling changes 
in the united states market  our current practice is to offer sales incentives primarily in connection with launches of new products or changes of existing products where demand has not yet been established 
we monitor and restrict sales in the united states market in order to limit wholesaler purchases in excess of their ordinary course of business inventory levels 
however  specific events such as the case of sales incentives described above or seasonal demand eg antivirals during an outbreak may justify purchases by wholesalers in excess of their ordinary course of business 
our revenue recognition policy on these types of purchases and on incentives in international markets is consistent with the policies described in the revenue recognition critical accounting policy 
income taxes we operate in numerous countries where our income tax returns are subject to audit 
internal and external tax professionals are employed to minimize tax audit adjustments where possible 
we consider the expected outcome of these audits in the calculation of our tax provision 
we assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance for assets that are not expected to result in a realized tax benefit 
a significant amount of judgment is used in this process  including preparation of forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives 
if we revise these forecasts or determine that certain planning events will not occur  an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made to tax expense in the period such determination is made 
we increased the valuation allowance significantly in the fourth quarter of to recognize the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the us net operating losses and research credits 
our us tax returns for the period from to are currently being reviewed by the internal revenue service 
while we believe the review will not result in the returns being found to contain any substantive and material deficiencies  there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service s findings will not have a material adverse effect on our reported effective tax rate and after tax cash flows 
in  we restructured our operations by contributing the stock of several non united states subsidiaries to a wholly owned dutch company 
at the time of the restructuring  we intended to avail ourselves of the non recognition provisions of the internal revenue code to avoid generating taxable income on the inter company transfer 
one of the requirements under the non recognition provisions was to file gain recognition agreements with our timely filed us corporate income tax return 
we have recently discovered that although it was clearly our intent to file the gain recognition agreements and we have operated as if such filings had been submitted  former management inadvertently omitted the gain recognition agreements from our filing 
in accordance with treasury guidelines  a formal request has been made to the internal revenue service to rule that reasonable cause existed for the failure to provide these agreements 
while management is still evaluating the underlying values of the stock contributed  if the requested relief were to be denied and the matter could not otherwise be resolved favorably with the internal revenue service  management believes the resulting cash tax obligation would be offset by a substantial portion of our accumulated tax loss carryforwards 
during the fourth quarter of  legislation was passed the american jobs creation act of 
the legislation provides for a special one time tax deduction of percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated to the united states 
the range of reasonably possible amounts of unremitted earnings that is 
table of contents being considered for repatriation and the related potential range of income tax effects of such repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we are evaluating the effects of this law  and are expecting to complete the evaluation and develop an appropriate plan of action during the first half of impairment of property  plant and equipment we evaluate the carrying value of property  plant and equipment in accordance with guidelines 
in evaluating property  plant and equipment  we determine whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the property  plant and equipment with its carrying value 
if the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the carrying value of the property  plant and equipment with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flows analysis  independent appraisals or preliminary offers from prospective buyers 
valuation of intangible assets we periodically review intangible assets for impairment using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
we determine whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future operating income of the product line with its carrying value 
if the undiscounted operating income is less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the value of each intangible asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flows analysis 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired and for the assessment of impairment 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we evaluated the businesses included in discontinued operations by comparing the carrying value of each intangible asset to their fair value  as determined using discounted cash flows analysis  appraisals  and purchase offers 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the intangible asset impairment estimated process include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows  the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows  and the assessment of the asset s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset  including consideration of any technical  legal or regulatory 
purchase price allocation including acquired in process research and development the purchase price for the amarin and ribapharm acquisitions were allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
additionally  estimates for the purchase price allocations may change as subsequent information becomes available 
we value in process research and development ipr d acquired in a business combination based on an approach consistent with the aicpa practice aid  assets acquired in business combinations to be used in research and development activities a focus in software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries 
the amounts expensed as acquired ipr d represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the data used to determine fair value requires significant judgment 
the estimated fair values were based on our use of a discounted cash flow model based on an estimate of future sales and an 
table of contents average gross profit margin of and for amarin and ribapharm  respectively 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows using a tax rate of and for amarin and ribapharm  respectively were probability weighted to take account of the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization 
the assumed tax rates are our estimate of the effective tax rate for acquisitions of similar type of assets 
these cash flows were then discounted to a present value using a discount rate of and for amarin and ribapharm  respectively 
in addition  solely for the purposes of estimating the fair value of these ipr d projects related to the acquisition of ribapharm as of august   the following assumptions were made future research and development costs of approximately  would be incurred to complete the ipr d projects 
these future costs are primarily for phase iii testing of viramidine and phase ii and iii testing of pradefovir  and the ipr d projects  which were in various stages of development from phase i to phase ii clinical trials  are expected to reach completion by the end of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of acquisitions 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects include the uncertainty of our ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of product candidates based on the data from clinical trials and of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions we used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of these projects will materialize as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from the estimated results 
contingencies we are exposed to contingencies in the ordinary course of business  such as legal proceedings and business related claims  which range from product and environmental liabilities to tax matters 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information is known

our stockholders and prospective stockholders should consider carefully the following risk factors  in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from these anticipated in this report as a result of various factors  including those set forth below 
if we cannot successfully develop or obtain future products  our growth would be delayed 
our future growth will depend  in large part  upon our ability to develop or obtain and commercialize new products and new formulations of  or indications for  current products 
we are engaged in an active research and development program involving compounds owned by us or licensed from others which we may 
table of contents commercially develop in the future 
we are in clinical trials for viramidine and pradefovir 
the process of successfully commercializing products is time consuming  expensive and unpredictable 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or acquire new products  successfully complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals to use these products for proposed or new clinical indications  manufacture our potential products in compliance with regulatory requirements or in commercial volumes  or gain market acceptance for such products 
in addition  changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections 
it may be necessary for us to enter into other licensing arrangements  similar to our arrangements with schering plough and roche  with other pharmaceutical companies in order to market effectively any new products or new indications for existing products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such licensing arrangements on terms favorable to us or at all 
on january   we announced that we have completed enrollment in viser  a phase trial for viramidine 
phase is the last phase in a multi phase clinical evaluation that may lead to the filing of a new drug application 
there can be no assurance that our clinical trials for viramidine will be successful  that we will be granted approval to market viramidine for the indication we are seeking or that viramidine will be a commercially successful product 
a substantial amount of the value of xcel pharmaceuticals is attributed to retigabine  which is being developed as an adjunctive treatment for partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy 
retigabine has completed phase studies and we expect to begin phase clinical trials in there can be no assurance that the clinical trials for retigabine will be successful  that we will be granted approval to market retigabine for the indication being sought or that retigabine will be a commercially successful product 
if we do not obtain approval of retigabine  significant anticipated benefits of the xcel acquisition  including revenue enhancements  would not be realized 
the introduction of generic products has significantly impacted ribavirin royalties and may negatively impact our ability to finance research and development activities 
while ribavirin royalty revenues earned by us under our ribavirin license agreements with schering plough and roche have declined  they still represent an important source of revenues to us 
schering plough markets ribavirin for use in combination with its interferon product under the trade name rebetol as a therapy for the treatment of hepatitis c and roche markets ribavirin for use in combination with its interferon product under the name copegus 
under the terms of their license agreements  schering plough and roche each have sole discretion to determine the pricing of ribavirin and the amount and timing of resources devoted to their respective marketing of ribavirin 
competition from generic pharmaceutical companies in the us market has had a material negative impact on our royalty revenue beginning in by significantly reducing royalties payable to us by schering plough and eliminating royalties payable to us by roche in the us market 
our research and development activities have historically been funded by the royalties received from schering plough and roche 
prospectively  substantially greater reliance on the profitability of the specialty pharmaceutical business will be required 
although our financial planning has included an expectation of the erosion of royalty revenue due to generic competition for ribavirin in the united states  a greater than expected erosion of royalties from the united states  or a significant decrease in royalties from expected levels for markets other than the united states  could negatively impact our ability to finance research and development and other activities 
we rely on a limited amount of financial information provided by schering plough and roche to estimate the amounts due to us under the royalty agreements 
while we believe the schering plough agreement specifies that we are to be reimbursed based on net sales as determined under an accrual basis  we have recently become aware that schering plough may be calculating reimbursements based on a method under which returns are deducted as incurred rather than on an accrual basis 
based upon the information provided by schering plough for the fourth quarter of  schering plough s sales of rebetol in the united states were negative 
as a result of the uncertainty with royalties associated with sales of rebetol in the united 
table of contents states  a reserve has been established for negative royalties caused by negative sales of rebetol in the united states  however  due to the limited information provided by schering plough  there can be no assurance that such amounts will be adequate to cover additional negative royalty amounts in future periods 
various parties are opposing our ribavirin patents in actions before the european patent office  and we are responding to these oppositions 
while data exclusivity for the combination therapies marketed by schering plough and roche is scheduled to continue in the major markets of the european union until for schering plough and for roche  regulatory approvals and schemes may change and or studies regarding ribavirin in combination with interferon may be replicated  allowing earlier introduction of generics into such markets should the patent opposition be successful 
if our focus on the development of viramidine does not result in an approved and commercially successful product  our business will be adversely affected 
we focus our research and development activities on areas in which we have particular strengths  particularly antivirals 
the outcome of any development program is highly uncertain 
although viramidine appears promising and has advanced to phase clinical trials  it may yet fail to yield a commercial product 
success in preclinical and early stage clinical trials may not necessarily translate into success in large scale clinical trials 
further  to be successful in clinical trials  increased investment will be necessary  which will adversely affect short term profitability 
in addition  we will need to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in order to market viramidine 
even if viramidine appears promising in large scale phase clinical trials  regulatory approval may not be achieved 
the results of clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent approval or result in the need for post marketing studies 
in addition  changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and fda review of a new application may cause delays or rejection 
even if we receive regulatory approval  this approval may include limitations on the indications for which we can market the product 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to satisfy the needed regulatory requirements  and we may suffer a significant reduction from planned revenue as a result 
as we develop and commercialize new products  we will have to incur a sizeable amount of research and development expenses to advance such products through the clinical trial and regulatory approval process 
such expenditures will have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows when incurred 
as of march  we are in clinical trials with three products  viramidine  pradefovir and retigabine 
these clinical trials require significant research and development expenditures 
we completed enrollment of two phase studies being conducted for viramidine in january and a phase study for pradefovir in november we expect that research and development expenses will increase in compared to as progress continues with the clinical trials of viramidine and pradefovir 
the increased amount of research and development expenses will negatively impact our earnings and cash flows 
additionally  retigabine is expected to begin phase clinical trials in we will incur significant additional research and development expenses in connection with phase studies for retigabine 
third parties may be able to sell generic forms of our products or block our sales of our products if our intellectual property rights or data exclusivity rights do not sufficiently protect us  patent rights of third parties may also be asserted against us 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful exclusivity protection for our products and product candidates in key markets throughout the world via patent protection and or data exclusivity protection 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we will be able to protect our products from generic substitution by third parties only to the extent that our technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents  effectively maintained as trade secrets or are protected by data exclusivity 
however  our currently pending or future patent applications may not issue as patents 
any patent issued may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
furthermore  our patents may not be sufficiently 
table of contents broad to prevent third parties from producing generic substitutes for our products 
lastly  data exclusivity schemes vary from country to country and may be limited or eliminated as governments seek to reduce pharmaceutical costs by increasing the speed and ease of approval of generic products 
in order to protect or enforce patent and or data exclusivity rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties  and we may be similarly sued by others 
we may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property and data exclusivity actions are costly and divert technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
we may not prevail in any of these suits 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceeding  resulting in a finding of non infringement or invalidity of our patents  or a lack of protection via data exclusivity  may allow entry of generic substitutes for our products 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with such litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during such litigation 
in addition  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our securities 
the existence of a patent will not necessarily protect us from competition 
competitors may successfully challenge our patents  produce similar drugs that do not infringe our patents or produce drugs in countries that do not respect our patents 
no patent can protect its holder from a claim of infringement of another patent 
therefore  our patent position cannot and does not provide an assurance that the manufacture  sale or use of products patented by us would not infringe a patent right of another 
while we know of no actual or threatened claim of infringement that would be material to us  there can be no assurance that such a claim will not be asserted 
if such a claim is asserted  there can be no assurance that the resolution of the claim would permit us to continue producing the relevant product on commercially reasonable terms 
obtaining necessary government approvals is time consuming and not assured 
fda approval must be obtained in the united states and approval must be obtained from comparable agencies in other countries prior to marketing or manufacturing new pharmaceutical products for use by humans 
obtaining fda approval for new products and manufacturing processes can take a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
numerous requirements must be satisfied  including preliminary testing programs on animals and subsequent clinical testing programs on humans  to establish product safety and efficacy 
no assurance can be given that we will obtain approval in the united states  or any other country  of any application we may submit for the commercial sale of a new or existing drug or compound 
nor can any assurance be given that if such approval is secured  the approved labeling will not have significant labeling limitations  or that those drugs or compounds will be commercially successful 
the fda and other regulatory agencies in other countries also periodically inspect manufacturing facilities both in the united states and abroad 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  warning letters  sanctions  fines  delays or suspensions of approvals  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions  manufacturing interruptions  costly corrective actions  injunctions  adverse publicity against us and our products  refusal to renew marketing applications  and criminal prosecutions 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent or delay us from obtaining future regulatory approvals or jeopardize existing approvals 
difficulties with acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our future growth 
we intend to pursue a strategy of targeted expansion through the acquisition of compatible businesses and product lines and the formation of strategic alliances  joint ventures and other business combinations 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete or finance any future acquisition or investment 
table of contents or that any acquisitions that we do complete will be completed at prices or on terms that prove to be advantageous to us 
failure in integrating the operations of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may have a material adverse impact on our future growth and success 
if competitors develop vaccines or more effective or less costly drugs for our target indications  our business could be seriously harmed 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
viramidine and many of the drugs that we are attempting to discover will be competing with new and existing therapies 
many companies in the united states and abroad are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting 
for example  human genome sciences  inc submitted an investigational new drug application with the fda in october and is currently conducting a phase human clinical trial of albuferon for treatment of hepatitis c 
if albuferon or other therapies that do not incorporate the use of our products prove to be a more effective treatment for hepatitis c than the combination therapy involving ribavirin  then our royalty revenues from ribavirin could significantly decrease  and we may not realize any revenues from viramidine 
in addition  there are institutions engaged in research on the development of a vaccine to prevent hepatitis c 
the availability of such a vaccine could have a material adverse effect on our revenues from sales of products treating hepatitis c 
many of our competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do 
many of our competitors spend significantly more on research and development related activities than we do 
others may succeed in developing products that are more effective than those currently marketed or proposed for development by us 
progress by other researchers in areas similar to those being explored by us may result in further competitive challenges 
in addition  academic institutions  government agencies  and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products 
they may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors 
products under development may include  but are not limited to inferferons or immunomodulators being developed by human genome sciences  inc  intermune  inc  intarcia therapeutics  inc  sciclone pharmaceuticals  inc  anadys  and coley pharmaceuticals group  inc  impdh inhibitors being developed by roche and vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated  and protease or polymerase inhibitors being developed by boehringer ingelheim  vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated  schering plough  wyeth viropharma inc and idenix pharmaceuticals  inc

and novartis ag 
if our products are alleged to be harmful  we may not be able to sell them and we may be subject to product liability claims not covered by insurance 
the nature of our business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
using our drug candidates in clinical trials also exposes us to product liability claims 
these risks will expand with respect to drugs  if any  that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
even if a drug were approved for commercial use by an appropriate governmental agency  there can be no assurance that users will not claim that effects other than those intended may result from our products 
while to date no material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products  including ribavirin  has been successfully maintained against us  a substantial claim  if successful  could have a material negative impact on us 

table of contents in the event that anyone alleges that any of our products are harmful  we may experience reduced consumer demand for our products or our products may be recalled from the market 
in addition  we may be forced to defend lawsuits and  if unsuccessful  to pay a substantial amount in damages 
we currently do not have insurance against product liability risks for most of our commercially developed products 
insurance is expensive and  if we seek such insurance in the future  it may not be available on acceptable terms 
even if obtained  insurance may not fully protect us against potential product liability claims 
we currently maintain clinical trial insurance in the major markets in which we conduct clinical trials 
there is no assurance  however  that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all claims 
we are involved in various legal proceedings that could adversely affect us 
we are involved in several legal proceedings  including those described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
defending against claims and any unfavorable legal decisions  settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on us 
existing and future audits by  or other disputes with  taxing authorities may not be resolved favorably for us 
our income tax returns are currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions 
existing and future audits by  or other disputes with  taxing authorities may not be resolved favorably for us 
for instance  our us tax returns for the period from to are currently being reviewed by the internal revenue service 
while we believe the review will not result in a material adjustment to reported results  there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service s findings will not have a material adverse effect on our reported effective tax rate and after tax cash flows 
in  we restructured our operations by contributing the stock of several non united states subsidiaries to a wholly owned dutch company 
at the time of the restructuring  we intended to avail ourselves of the non recognition provisions of the internal revenue code to avoid generating taxable income on the inter company transfer 
one of the requirements under the non recognition provisions was to file gain recognition agreements with our timely filed us corporate income tax return 
we recently discovered that although it was clearly our intent to file the gain recognition agreements and we have operated as if such filings had been submitted  our former management inadvertently omitted the gain recognition agreements from our filing 
in accordance with treasury guidelines  a formal request has been made to the internal revenue service to rule that reasonable cause existed for the failure to provide these agreements 
while we are still evaluating the underlying values of the stock contributed  if the requested relief were to be denied and the matter could not otherwise be resolved favorably with the internal revenue service  we believe there would be no near term cash impact as the gain would likely offset a substantial portion of our accumulated tax loss carryforwards  however  the impact to net income in the period such obligation became probable would be material 
our flexibility in maximizing commercialization opportunities for our compounds may be limited by our obligations to schering plough 
in november  we entered into an agreement that provides schering plough with an option to acquire the rights to up to three of our products intended to treat hepatitis c that they designate prior to our entering into phase clinical trials and a right for first last refusal to license various compounds we may develop and elect to license to others 
viramidine was not subject to the option of schering plough  but it would be subject to their right of first last refusal if we elected to license it to a third party 
in addition  the agreement provides for certain other disclosures about our research and development activities 
the interest of potential collaborators in obtaining rights to our compounds or the terms of any agreements we ultimately enter into for these rights may be impacted by our agreement with schering plough 
a commercialization partner other than schering plough might have otherwise been preferable due to that potential partner s strength in a given disease area or geographic region or for other reasons 

table of contents we are subject to uncertainty related to health care reform measures and reimbursement policies 
the levels at which government authorities  private health insurers  hmos and other organizations reimburse the costs of drugs and treatments related to those drugs will have an effect on the successful commercialization of our drug candidates 
we cannot be sure that reimbursement in the united states or elsewhere will be available for any drugs we may develop or  if already available  will not be decreased in the future 
also  we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for  or the price of  our drugs 
if reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels  we may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on the manufacture and commercialization of existing and any future drugs 
consequently  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of approved health care products 
third party payors may not establish and maintain price levels sufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development or our continued manufacture and sale of existing drug products 
if our nucleoside analog library is destroyed because of an earthquake or other disaster  our research and development program may be seriously harmed 
the laboratory books and the compounds that comprise our nucleoside analog library are all located at our headquarters in costa mesa  california  near areas where earthquakes have occurred in the past 
there are duplicate copies of laboratory books off premises  but there are no backup copies of the product candidates we are currently developing 
no duplicate copies of our nucleoside analog library exist because making copies would be prohibitively expensive and the library has not been moved off site because our scientific staff is currently in the process of screening it 
our ability to develop potential product candidates from our nucleoside analog library would be significantly impaired if these compounds were destroyed in an earthquake  fire or other disaster 
any insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses 
dependence on key personnel leaves us vulnerable to a negative impact if they leave 
we believe that our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of the key members of management 
the loss of their services could have a negative impact on us 
in addition  our research and development effort depends upon the principal members of our scientific staff 
our success depends upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain qualified scientific personnel 
qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries 
we may not be able to attract additional personnel or retain existing employees 
our third party manufacturers failure to comply with fda regulations could cause interruption of the manufacture of our products 
we have contracted with third parties to manufacture some of our drug products  including products under the rights acquired from other pharmaceutical companies 
our manufacturers are required to adhere to current good manufacturing cgmp regulations enforced by the fda or similar regulations required by regulatory agencies in other countries 
compliance with the fda s cgmp requirements applies to both drug products seeking regulatory approval and to approved drug products 
the manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers must be inspected and found to be in full compliance with cgmp standards before approval for marketing 
contract manufacturers of our approved products are subject to ongoing regulation by the fda  including compliance with cgmp requirements 
our dependence upon others to manufacture our products may adversely affect our profit margins and our ability to develop and obtain approval for our products on a timely and competitive basis  if at all 
failure for our contract manufacturers to comply with cgmp regulations can result in enforcement action by the fda  including  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
in addition  delays or difficulties with our contract manufacturers in producing  packaging  or distributing our products could adversely affect the sales of our current products or introduction of other products 

table of contents schering plough manufactures and sells ribavirin under license from us 
in may  schering plough signed a consent decree of permanent injunction with the fda  agreeing to measures to assure that the drug products manufactured at their puerto rico plant are made in compliance with fda s current good manufacturing practice regulations 
while schering plough has advised us that the deficiencies were not specifically applicable to the production of ribavirin  the consent decree covers the facility producing ribavirin 
schering plough s ability to manufacture and ship ribavirin could be affected by temporary interruption of some production lines to install system upgrades and further enhance compliance  and other technical production and equipment qualification issues 
if the fda is not satisfied with schering plough s compliance under the consent decree  the fda could take further regulatory actions against schering plough  including the seizure of products  an injunction against further manufacture  a product recall or other actions that could interrupt production of ribavirin 
interruption of ribavirin production for a sustained period of time could materially reduce our royalty revenue 
our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our operations 
we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the united states 
including ribavirin royalties  approximately and of our revenue was generated outside the united states during the year ended december  and  respectively 
we sell our pharmaceutical products in countries around the world and employ approximately  individuals in countries other than the united states 
the international scope of our operations may lead to volatile financial results and difficulties in managing our operations because of  but not limited to  the following difficulties and costs of staffing  severance and benefit payments and managing international operations  exchange controls  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws  the geographic  time zone  language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables in and moving cash out of certain geographic regions  the need for a significant amount of available cash from operations to fund our business in a number of geographic and economically diverse locations  and political  social and economic instability in emerging markets in which we currently operate 
many of our key processes  opportunities and expenses are a function of national and or local government regulation 
significant changes in regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business 
the process by which pharmaceutical products are approved is lengthy and highly regulated 
we have developed expertise in managing this process in the many markets around the world 
our multi year clinical trials programs are planned and executed to conform to these regulations  and once begun  can be difficult and expensive to change should the regulations regarding approval of pharmaceutical products significantly change 
in addition  we depend on patent law and data exclusivity to keep generic products from reaching the market before we have obtained our targeted return on our investment in the discovery and development of our products 
in assessing whether we will invest in any development program  or license a product from a third party  we assess the likelihood of patent and or data exclusivity under the laws and regulations then in effect 
if those schemes significantly change in a large market  or across many smaller markets  our ability to protect our investment may be adversely affected 

table of contents appropriate tax planning requires that we consider the current and prevailing national and local tax laws and regulations  as well as international tax treaties and arrangements that we enter into with various government authorities 
changes in national local tax regulations  or changes in political situations may limit or eliminate the effects of our tax planning 
due to the large portion of our business conducted outside the united states  we have significant foreign currency risk 
we sell products in many countries that are susceptible to significant foreign currency risk 
in some of these markets we sell products for us dollars 
while this eliminates our direct currency risk in such markets  it increases our credit risk because if a local currency is devalued significantly  it becomes more expensive for customers in that market to purchase our products in united states dollars 
in  we entered into foreign currency hedge arrangements to hedge a portion of our exposure against variability in the euro 
we continue to evaluate the possibility of entering into additional hedge arrangements 
we are subject to price control restrictions on our pharmaceutical products in the majority of countries in which we operate 
there is a risk that other jurisdictions may enact price control restrictions  and that the restrictions that currently exist may be increased 
a significant portion of the sales of our products are in europe  a market in which price increases are controlled  and in some instances  reductions are imposed 
our future sales and gross profit could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to obtain appropriate price increases  or if our products are subject to price reductions 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use  storage  handling or disposal of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for damages that result 
any liability could exceed our resources 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products 
the cost of compliance with  or any potential violation of  these laws and regulations could be significant 
any insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses 
our stockholder rights plan and anti takeover provisions of our charter documents could provide our board of directors with the ability to delay or prevent a change in control of us 
our stockholder rights plan  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and provisions of the delaware general corporation law provides our board of directors with the ability to deter hostile takeovers or delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets 
we evaluate our exposure to such risks on an ongoing basis  and seek ways to manage these risks to an acceptable level  based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and cost 
we do not hold any significant amount of market risk sensitive instruments whose value is subject to market price risk 
our significant foreign currency exposure relates to the euro  the mexican peso  the polish zloty  the swiss franc and the canadian dollar 
we seek to manage our foreign currency exposure by maintaining the majority of cash balances at foreign subsidiaries in us dollars and through operational means by managing local currency revenues in relation to local currency costs 
we are currently taking steps to mitigate the impact of foreign currency on the income statement  which include hedging our foreign currency exposure 
in march and june  we entered into foreign currency hedge transactions to reduce our exposure to variability in the euro 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not discussed or quantified in the following analysis 
at december   the fair value of our financial instruments was as follows in thousands assets liabilities notional contract carrying fair description amount value value forward contracts interest rate swaps outstanding debt we currently do not hold financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our financial assets are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short duration 
at december   we had  of foreign denominated variable rate debt that would subject it to both interest rate and currency risks 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with respect to  principal amount of our senior notes 
a basis point increase in interest rates affecting our financial instruments would not have had a material effect on our pretax earnings 
in addition  we had  of fixed rate debt as of december   that requires us dollar repayment 
to the extent that we require  as a source of debt repayment  earnings and cash flow from some of our units located in foreign countries  we are subject to risk of changes in the value of certain currencies relative to the us dollar 
however  the increase of a basis points in interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our remaining fixed rate debt instruments by approximately  as of december  we estimated the sensitivity of the fair value of our derivative foreign exchange contracts to a hypothetical strengthening and weakening of the spot exchange rates for the us dollar against the euro at december  based on a current fair value of our derivative foreign exchange contracts of  the analysis showed that a strengthening of the us dollar would have resulted in a loss from a fair value change of  and a weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a loss from a fair value change of  in these instruments 
losses and gains on the underlying transactions being hedged would have largely offset any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis
