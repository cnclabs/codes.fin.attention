executive summary our net sales in increased to  million from  million in  an increase of percent 
excluding the favorable impact of million of foreign currency fluctuations  our net sales increased percent 
our gross profit increased to  million  or percent of net sales  in from  million  or percent of net sales  in our reported net income for was  million  or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  in our reported results included net after tax charges of million  or per diluted share  in as compared to net after tax charges of million  or per diluted share  in in addition  our cash provided by operating activities was  million in as compared to million in this growth in resulted largely from sales of our taxus express paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system that we launched in the united states us in march and in our europe and inter continental markets during the first quarter of taxus stent sales in were  million  or percent of our net sales  as compared to million  or percent of our net sales  in we have achieved leading drug eluting stent market share positions within our us  europe and inter continental markets 
we have not yet launched a drug eluting stent system within our japan market 
in the us  physicians have rapidly adopted drug eluting stent technology 
as of december   we estimate that physicians in the us have converted approximately percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents 
in our europe and inter continental markets  conversion rates have been more gradual primarily due to the timing of local reimbursement and funding levels 
as of december   we estimate that physicians in our europe and inter continental markets have converted approximately percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents 
we continue to expect year to year growth in our drug eluting stent sales in as a result of a full year of sales in the us and increased adoption rates in our europe and inter continental markets 
further  our drug eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug eluting products in the us market and there is uncertainty regarding the timing of new entrants into that market 
during  we partially invested our increased gross profit in various research and development initiatives  particularly related to our coronary stent franchise  we funded additional headcount and programs to strengthen our sales and marketing organization  and we made enhancements to our manufacturing and distribution network 
in  we will continue to invest aggressively to sustain our leadership in drug eluting stent technology and to expand our new product offerings through internal development  acquisitions and strategic alliances 
we continued to generate strong operating cash flow during  which increased over billion as compared to in addition  due to favorable market conditions  we raised billion from the public markets through two bond offerings during we used cash generated from operating activities and from the public debt issuances to repay short term debt obligations  to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market and to fund strategic alliances and acquisitions  including our million acquisition of advanced bionics corporation advanced bionics 
the acquisition of advanced bionics expands our technology portfolio into the implantable microelectronic device market that physicians use to treat numerous neurological disorders 
the net after tax charges consisted of a million provision for legal and regulatory exposures  a million enhancement to our k retirement savings plan k plan  million of purchased research and development  a million charge relating to taxes on the approximately billion of cash that we plan to repatriate in under the american jobs creation act of  and a million non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans 
the net after tax charges consisted of million of purchased research and development and million in charges related to litigation and product liability settlements

our coronary stent revenues in the us increased in by million  or percent  due to sales of the express tm coronary stent system that we launched in september sales from our other cardiovascular products  including the maverick coronary angioplasty balloon catheters and the filterwire ex embolic protection device  also increased by million  or percent  as compared to the remainder of the increase in our us revenues related to sales growth in each of our other us divisions 
international net sales in  our international net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to sales growth of our taxus stent system by million  or percent  in our europe and inter continental markets 
we launched the taxus stent system in these markets during the first quarter of the remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to incremental growth in various product franchises  none of which was individually significant 
in  our japan net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to primarily due to million in sales of our express coronary stent system 
we launched the express coronary stent system in japan during the first quarter of during the second quarter of  one of our competitors launched its drug eluting stent in japan 
as a result  we experienced declining coronary stent sales in japan throughout the second half of until we launch our drug eluting stent in japan  which we expect to occur late in  we do not expect significant sales of our coronary stents in japan 
in  our international net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to million in sales of our taxus stent system in our europe and inter continental markets 
the remainder of the increase in our net sales in these markets was due to incremental growth in various product franchises  including our ultrasound product line as well as peripheral vascular stents and balloons 
gross profit the following table provides a summary of our gross profit of net of net of net in millions sales sales sales gross profit in  our gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points as compared to shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products  primarily drug eluting coronary stent systems in the us  increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by percentage points 
this improvement in our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially reduced by percentage point related to million in inventory write downs  with million of that amount attributable to our recalls of certain coronary stent systems and million attributable to the write down of taxus stent inventory due to shelf life dating 
in addition  other expenses primarily associated with increased investments in our manufacturing capabilities reduced gross profit as a percentage of net sales during by approximately percentage point 
we anticipate that our gross profit will continue to increase during due to expected sales growth of higher margin products  including our taxus stent system 
in  our gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points as compared to cost reductions resulting from prior year initiatives that related to plant network optimization  manufacturing process control and supply chain optimization increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by percentage points 
in addition  shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products  primarily coronary stents  increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by percentage points 
these improvements in gross profit were partially reduced by increased period expenses  including start up costs associated with taxus stent system production  which decreased gross profit as a percentage of our net sales by percentage point

royalty expense attributable to sales of our taxus stent system increased by million to million for as compared to in november  we exercised our right under an 
table of contents existing licensing agreement with angiotech pharmaceuticals  inc angiotech to obtain an exclusive license for the use of paclitaxel and other agents for certain applications in the coronary vascular field 
in exchange for the exclusive license  we will pay angiotech an additional royalty of one percentage point on certain future sales 
we anticipate that royalty expense  as a percentage of our net sales  will increase to approximately percent in in addition  we continue to enter strategic technological alliances  some of which include royalty commitments 
in  our royalty expense increased by million  or percent  as compared to as a percentage of our net sales  royalty expense increased to percent in from percent in the increase related to sales growth of our royalty bearing products  including million of royalty expense payable on sales of our taxus stent system 
amortization expense in  our amortization expense increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisitions in of advanced bionics and precision vascular systems  inc pvs 
amortization expense for these two acquisitions was million in as a percentage of our net sales  amortization expense decreased to percent in from percent in primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in in  our amortization expense increased by million  or percent  as compared to as a percentage of our net sales  amortization expense increased to percent in from percent in the increase related primarily to amortization of intangible assets we acquired during and interest expense and other  net our interest expense increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels and in average market interest rates on our floating rate borrowings 
our other  net reflected expense of million in and expense of million in in  our other  net included realized gains of million from sales of investments that were offset by asset write downs of million associated with certain investments in and loans to privately held companies 
we do not believe that these write downs of assets will have a material impact on our future operations 
in addition  our other  net included interest income of million in and million in our interest income increased in due to growth in our overseas cash balances and our increased investment in securities with longer maturity dates 
our other  net reflected expense of million in  which included a donation of million to fund the boston scientific foundation  a charitable organization dedicated to the advancement of healthcare and education 
tax rate the following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate percentage point increase decrease versus versus reported tax rate impact of certain charges these charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
in  the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to related primarily to the net impact of certain charges during that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
these charges included a provision for an extraordinary dividend related to overseas cash balances we plan to repatriate in pursuant to the american jobs creation act  an accrual for our legal and regulatory exposures  an enhancement to our k plan  purchased research and development  and a non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans 
in addition  our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by more revenue being generated from products manufactured in lower tax jurisdictions 
offsetting this favorable impact was our decision to repatriate cash from certain of our non us operations that did not qualify under the american jobs creation act 
in connection with this decision  we established a deferred tax liability of million that we believe is adequate to cover the taxes related to this repatriation 

table of contents management currently estimates that our effective tax rate  excluding certain charges  will be approximately percent 
however  geographic changes in the manufacture of our products or future business acquisitions may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate 
in  the decrease in our reported tax rate as compared to related primarily to the decrease in our purchased research and development charges to million in from million in  which were not deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  during  we settled several audits and reduced our previous estimate for accrued taxes by million to reflect the resolution of these audits 
further  as we generated more revenue from products manufactured in lower tax jurisdictions  our overall effective tax rate was favorably impacted 
offsetting this favorable impact was our decision to repatriate cash from certain non us operations 
we established a deferred tax liability of million that we believe is adequate to cover the taxes related to this repatriation 
litigation related charges and credits in  we recorded a million provision for legal and regulatory exposures 
in  we agreed to settle a number of our outstanding product liability cases 
the cost of settlement in excess of our available insurance limits was million 
in addition  during  we recorded a million charge related to an adverse judgment in a suit filed by the federal trade commission 
in  we recorded a favorable settlement with medtronic  inc medtronic of million related to medtronic s rapid exchange stent delivery systems and angioplasty dilatation balloon catheters 
in addition  we recorded a net charge of million for settlements related to our rapid exchange catheter technology 
purchased research and development in  we recorded million of purchased research and development 
our purchased research and development consisted primarily of million relating to our june acquisition of advanced bionics and million relating to our april acquisition of pvs 
the most significant in process projects acquired in connection with our acquisitions included advanced bionics bion microstimulator and drug delivery pump  which collectively represented percent of our acquired in process projects value 
the bion microstimulator is an implantable neurostimulation device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions  including migraine headaches  urge incontinence  epilepsy and sleep apnea 
the cost to complete the bion microstimulator is estimated to be between million and million 
the advanced bionics drug delivery pump is an implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain 
the cost to complete the drug delivery pump is estimated to be between million and million 
as of the date we acquired advanced bionics  we expected the products to be commercially available on a worldwide basis within four years 
in  we recorded million of purchased research and development 
our purchased research and development consisted of million relating to our acquisition of inflow dynamics  inc inflow and million relating primarily to certain acquisitions we consummated in prior years 
the in process projects acquired in connection with our acquisition of inflow were not significant to our consolidated results 
the purchased research and development associated with the prior years acquisitions related primarily to our acquisition of embolic protection  inc epi and resulted from consideration that was contingent at the date of acquisition  but earned during in  we recorded million of purchased research and development 
our purchased research and development related primarily to the acquisitions of enteric medical technologies  inc emt and smart therapeutics  inc smart 
the most significant in process projects acquired in connection with our acquisitions included emt s enteryx liquid polymer technology and smart s atherosclerosis stent  which collectively represented percent of our acquired in process projects value 
enteryx is a patented liquid polymer for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms 
during  we completed the enteryx in process project and received fda approval for this technology 
the total cost for us to complete the project was million 
the atherosclerosis stent is a self expanding nitinol stent designed to treat narrowing of the arteries around the brain 
we continue to pursue the development of smart s atherosclerosis stent and believe we have a reasonable chance of completing the project 
we have spent million on this project as of december  and estimate additional costs of million to complete the project 
these estimates approximate our estimates at the time of acquisition 

table of contents outlook in  we increased our net sales by percent  our reported net income by percent and our cash provided by operating activities by percent 
this growth was primarily due to sales of our taxus stent system that was approved for sale in the us on march  we estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market will exceed billion in and approximate billion in historically  the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility 
drug eluting stents are estimated to represent approximately percent of the worldwide coronary stent market in and approximately percent in our drug eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug eluting products in the us market and there is uncertainty regarding the timing of new entrants into that market 
we believe that we can maintain our leadership position within the drug eluting stent market for a variety of reasons  including the positive and consistent results of our taxus clinical trials  the performance benefits of our current technology  the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products and the planned launch sequence of these products  our overall market leadership in interventional medicine and our sizeable interventional cardiology sales force  and our significant investments in our sales  clinical  marketing and manufacturing capabilities 
however  a material decline in our drug eluting stent revenue would have a significant adverse impact on our future operating results 
the most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting coronary stent market and our position within this market include unexpected variations in clinical results or product performance of our and our competition s products  the timing of new competitive launches  the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and reimbursement policies  litigation related to intellectual property  continued physician confidence in our technology  the average number of stents used per procedure  expansion of indications for use  and the international adoption rate of drug eluting stent technology 
we recently announced nine month results from our taxus v clinical trial 
taxus v expands on the taxus iv pivotal trial by studying a higher risk patient population  including patients with small vessels  large vessels and long lesions requiring multiple overlapping stents 
the overall taxus v study met its primary endpoint of safety and efficacy as well as all secondary endpoints 
in addition  stent thrombosis rates were virtually identical between the taxus stent and bare metal stents indicating comparable safety of drug eluting stents and bare metal stents 
however  inconsistent clinical data from existing or future trials conducted by us  by our competitors or by third parties may impact our position in and share of the drug eluting stent market 
our drug eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug eluting products in the us market 
we expect our share of the drug eluting stent market as well as unit prices to be adversely impacted as additional competitors enter the drug eluting stent market  which we anticipate during internationally and during in the us during the first quarter of  we completed our initial launch of our next generation drug eluting stent product  the taxus libert coronary stent system  in certain inter continental markets 
we expect to launch the taxus libert coronary stent system in europe during and in the us during  subject to regulatory approval 
in  johnson johnson announced its intention to acquire guidant corporation guidant 
johnson johnson and guidant are two of our primary competitors in the coronary stent market and this acquisition may create increased volatility and uncertainty within the coronary stent market 
in addition  during the second quarter of  one of our competitors launched its drug eluting stent in japan  which has converted rapidly to drug eluting stent technology 
in order to receive regulatory approval of the taxus stent system in japan  we were required during to conduct a small clinical trial using the taxus stent system with the antiplatelet therapy ticlid 
we currently expect to launch the taxus stent system in japan late in  subject to regulatory approval 
due to the timing of regulatory approval for our taxus stent system and recent government mandated  industry wide pricing reductions for medical devices in japan  we believe that our operating income in japan may be reduced by approximately million in as compared to until we launch our drug eluting stent in japan  it is likely that our japan business will be subject to significant market share and price pressure 

table of contents there continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market 
we are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our competitors  including johnson johnson  medtronic and medinol ltd 
medinol 
there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our objectives in the market 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for a description of these legal proceedings 
the manufacture of our taxus stent system involves the integration of multiple technologies  critical components  raw materials and complex processes 
inventory levels may be impacted by significant favorable or unfavorable changes in forecasted demand as well as disruptions associated with the taxus stent manufacturing process 
variability in expected demand or the timing of the launch of next generation products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges 
in july and august  we announced the voluntary recalls of approximately  taxus express stent systems and  express stent systems  due to characteristics in the delivery catheters that had the potential to impede balloon deflation during a coronary angioplasty procedure 
as a result of our investigation made in conjunction with the recalls  we implemented reviews of our manufacturing process  additional inspections and an fda approved modification to the manufacturing process for these products 
we believe that these measures have been and continue to be effective in reducing the occurrence of balloon non deflation 
in connection with the voluntary recalls described above  we recorded a sales return reserve of million and an inventory write down of million 
the sales return reserve was established for all customer owned inventory that was subject to the recalls 
we reversed the sales return reserve in the second half of upon the replacement of recalled units with new units to customers 
the inventory write down related to inventory on consignment ie  inventory we owned and inventory on hand at our facilities that was subject to the recalls 
we placed the recalled inventory into quarantine upon receipt and we will scrap it when permitted by the fda 
we do not intend to sell the quarantined inventory 
in october  the fda indicated that it would seek no further regulatory action regarding the recalls 
our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances 
our acquisitions are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective  quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs 
management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate these businesses 
however  our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions 
in connection with these acquisitions and other strategic alliances  we have acquired numerous in process research and development platforms 
as we continue to undertake strategic initiatives  it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in process research and development platforms 
in addition  we have entered a significant number of strategic alliances with privately held and publicly traded companies 
many of these alliances involve equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company in the future 
we enter these strategic alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
the success of these alliances is an important element of our growth strategy 
however  the full benefit of these alliances is often dependent on the strength of the other companies underlying technology 
the inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings  or litigation related to these technologies  among other factors  may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances 
we expect to continue to invest aggressively in our drug eluting stent program to achieve sustained worldwide market leadership positions 
further  we anticipate increasing our focus and spending on internal research and development in areas outside of drug eluting stent technology 
we believe our focus will be primarily on endoscopic systems  carotid stenting  vascular sealing  endovascular aortic repair  cardiac rhythm management  bifurcation stenting and neuromodulation 
in addition  we will continue to seek market opportunities and growth through investments in strategic alliances and acquisitions 
potential future acquisitions  including companies with whom we currently have strategic alliances or options to purchase  may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional financing  depending on their size and nature 
international markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs 
our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions  foreign currency fluctuations  regulatory and reimbursement approvals  competitive offerings  infrastructure development  rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy 
any significant changes in the competitive  political  regulatory  reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our revenues and profits 

table of contents further  the trend in countries around the world  including japan  toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance  changing reimbursement models and more vigorous enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause medical device manufacturers like us to experience more uncertainty  delay  greater risk and higher expenses 
in addition  we are required to renew regulatory approvals in certain international jurisdictions  which may require additional testing and documentation 
a decision not to dedicate sufficient resources  or the failure to timely renew these approvals  may limit our ability to market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions 
these factors may impact the rate at which we can grow 
however  management believes that we are poised to take advantage of opportunities that exist in the markets we serve 
liquidity and capital resources the following table provides a summary of key performance indicators that we use to assess our liquidity in millions cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities cash provided by operating activities cash used for investing activities cash provided by used for financing activities ebitda the following represents a reconciliation between ebitda and net income in millions net income income taxes interest expense interest income depreciation and amortization ebitda management uses ebitda to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time 
users of our financial statements should consider this non gaap financial information in addition to  not as a substitute for  or as superior to  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
our ebitda included pre tax charges of million in  million in and million in operating activities cash generated by our operating activities continues to provide a major source of funds for investing in our growth 
the increase in cash generated by our operating activities is primarily attributable to the increase in ebitda offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities and certain tax related items 
the increase in ebitda was primarily due to sales of our taxus stent system 
a the pre tax charges consisted of a provision for legal and regulatory exposures  an enhancement to our k plan  purchased research and development and a non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans 
the pre tax charges consisted of purchased research and development and charges related to litigation and product liability settlements 
the pre tax charges consisted of purchased research and development  costs related to our global operations strategy that was substantially completed in  a charitable donation to fund the boston scientific foundation and special credits for net amounts received in connection with litigation settlements 

table of contents portion of the cash generated from these sales was invested in research and development projects and in our sales  clinical and manufacturing capabilities 
significant cash flow effects from our operating assets and liabilities in included increases in cash flow of million attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses and million attributable to taxes payable and other liabilities as well as decreases in cash flow of million attributable to trade accounts receivable and million attributable to inventories 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses related primarily to the enhancement we made to our k plan in  our provision for legal and regulatory exposures  royalty expense attributable to sales growth of royalty bearing products  and an increase in employee related accruals 
a portion of these accounts payable and accrued expenses will be paid in the beginning of the increase in taxes payable and other liabilities related primarily to the increase in income taxes payable associated with our income growth 
the increase in trade accounts receivable related primarily to our sales growth 
the increase in inventories related primarily to our accumulation of inventory to fulfill worldwide demand for the taxus stent system 
investing activities we made capital expenditures of million in as compared to million in the increase related primarily to our spending of million during for the purchase and build out of an office complex for our endosurgery division in the us the remainder of the increase was attributable to our capital spending to enhance our manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million during  which includes further investments in our manufacturing and distribution capabilities  as well as our facility network 
in  we began investing our excess cash in short term marketable securities with maturity dates that exceeded days in order to benefit from higher returns 
in  we purchased million of these investments and we received million from maturities of our short term marketable securities 
our investing activities during also included million of net payments attributable to our acquisition of advanced bionics  million of net payments attributable to our acquisition of pvs  million of acquisition related payments associated with epi  smart and inflow  and million of payments related to our strategic alliances with both privately held and publicly traded companies 
these payments were offset by million of cash proceeds from sales of privately held and publicly traded equity securities 
in march  we acquired advanced stent technologies  inc ast  a developer of stent delivery systems that are designed to address coronary artery disease in bifurcated vessels 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ast  we will pay approximately million in shares of our common stock plus future consideration that is contingent upon ast achieving certain milestones 
financing activities our cash flows from financing activities reflect proceeds from long term public debt issuances  repayment of short term borrowings  payments for share repurchases and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs 
the following table provides a summary at december of our net debt in millions short term debt long term debt gross debt less cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities net debt we had outstanding borrowings of  million at december  at a weighted average interest rate of percent as compared to outstanding borrowings of  million at december  at a weighted average interest rate of percent 
during  we received net proceeds from borrowings of million 
we used proceeds from debt issuances principally to fund our acquisitions and other strategic alliances 
our cash and cash equivalents primarily relate to our non us operations 
in october  the us enacted the american jobs creation act 
the american jobs creation act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income 
table of contents earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
although the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret certain provisions in the american jobs creation act  we believe that we have made an informed decision on the impact of the american jobs creation act on our repatriation plans 
based on that decision  we plan to repatriate  million in extraordinary dividends as defined in the american jobs creation act during the first quarter of and accordingly have recorded a tax liability of million as of december  in  we repatriated earnings of our non us subsidiaries for which we had previously accrued tax liabilities 
our resulting tax liabilities associated with this repatriation were million 
in addition  we established deferred tax liabilities of million for additional amounts we plan to repatriate from certain of our non us operations that did not qualify under the american jobs creation act 
the tax liability we accrued for earnings of non us subsidiaries to be remitted in the future is million at december  borrowings and credit arrangements revolving credit facilities as of december   our credit facilities totaled  million 
during  we refinanced and increased our credit facilities  which totaled  million as of december  our revolving credit facilities at december  consisted of a  million credit facility that terminates in may  a million credit facility that terminates in may and contains an option to convert into a one year term loan maturing in may  and a million uncommitted credit facility that terminates in june our use of the borrowings is unrestricted and the borrowings are unsecured 
our credit facilities provide us with borrowing capacity and support our commercial paper program 
we had million of commercial paper outstanding at december  at a weighted average interest rate of percent and  million outstanding at december  at a weighted average interest rate of percent 
in addition  we had billion japanese yen translated to million of credit facility borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of percent at december  as compared to no outstanding japanese yen revolving credit facility borrowings at december  we have a revolving credit and security facility that is secured by our us trade receivables and provides million of borrowing capacity 
during  we increased the facility borrowing capacity from million to million and extended the maturity to august borrowing availability under this facility changes based upon the amount of our eligible receivables  concentration of our eligible receivables and other factors 
certain significant changes in the quality of our receivables may require us to repay borrowings immediately under the facility 
the credit agreement required us to create a wholly owned entity  which we consolidate 
this entity purchases our us trade accounts receivable and then borrows from two third party financial institutions using these receivables as collateral 
the receivables and related borrowings remain on our balance sheet because we have the right to prepay any borrowings outstanding and effectively retain control over the receivables 
accordingly  pledged receivables are included as trade accounts receivable net  while the corresponding borrowings are included as debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit and security facility as compared to million of outstanding borrowings at a weighted average interest rate of percent at december  in addition  we had uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to billion japanese yen translated to million at december  and up to billion japanese yen translated to million at december  approximately million of notes receivable were discounted at an average interest rate of percent at december  and million were discounted at an average interest rate of percent at december  as of december   we intended to repay all of our short term debt obligations within the next twelve month period 
as of december   we had the ability and intent to refinance a portion of our short term debt on a long term basis through our revolving credit facilities and expected that a minimum of million of our short term obligations  including million of our commercial paper and million of our revolving credit and security facility borrowings  would remain outstanding beyond a twelve month period 
accordingly  at december   we classified million of our short term borrowings as long term borrowings 
senior notes we had senior notes of  million outstanding at december  and million outstanding at december  these senior notes are publicly registered securities 
at december  and december   we had million of senior notes outstanding that we will repay in march march notes upon maturity 
the march notes bear a semi annual coupon of percent  are not redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 

table of contents in june  we issued million of senior notes due june june notes under a public registration statement previously filed with the sec 
the june notes bear a semi annual coupon of percent  are redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
in november  we filed a public registration statement with the sec for the issuance of up to  million in various debt and equity securities 
under this public registration statement  we issued million of senior notes due january january notes and million of senior notes due january january notes 
the january notes bear a semi annual coupon of percent  are redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the january notes bear a semi annual coupon of percent  are redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of all of our senior notes 
we have recorded changes in the fair value of our senior notes since entering the interest rate swaps 
we recorded interest payments or receipts under the interest rate swap agreements as interest expense 
for our march interest rate swap  we pay interest at six month libor plus percentage points  which approximated percent at december  and percent at december  for our june interest rate swap  we pay interest at six month libor  which approximated percent at december  for our january interest rate swap  we pay interest at six month libor minus approximately percentage point and for our january interest rate swap  we pay interest at six month libor plus approximately percentage points 
as of december   the carrying amount of our june notes included million of unrealized gains that we recorded as other long term assets to recognize the fair value of the interest rate swap 
the fair values of our other interest rate swaps were immaterial at december  and december  equity in  we repurchased approximately million of our own shares at an aggregate cost of million 
in addition  during  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an additional million shares of our common stock at prevailing market prices on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the new authorization is in addition to approximately million shares remaining under our previous share repurchase authorizations 
our available cash and cash equivalents  future operating cash flow and credit facilities will fund our share repurchase program 
as of december   we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock under these authorizations and we have million shares of our common stock in our treasury at year end 
during the first quarter of  we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock 
we may repurchase additional shares throughout the remainder of depending on market conditions 
repurchased shares are available for reissuance under our equity incentive plans and for general corporate purposes  including strategic alliances and acquisitions 
during  we received million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the exercise patterns of employees 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments 
see notes d  f and g to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our business combinations  long term debt and lease arrangements 

table of contents payments due by period year after in millions or less years years years total debt operating leases purchase obligations  minimum royalty obligations total debt as reported in our consolidated balance sheets includes the mark to market effect of our interest rate swaps 
in accordance with us gaap  these obligations are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations related primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business 
we accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
we accounted for the business combinations completed before july  in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations 
we accounted for the business combinations completed after june  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
certain of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration 
for acquisitions completed before july   we allocate these payments  if made  to specific intangible asset categories  including purchased research and development  and assign the remainder to goodwill as if we had paid the consideration at the date of acquisition 
for acquisitions completed after june   we allocate these payments  if made  to goodwill 
payment of the additional consideration is generally contingent upon the acquired companies reaching certain performance milestones  including attaining specified revenue levels  achieving product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals 
in  we recorded amounts for acquisition related obligations primarily as an adjustment to goodwill 
of the amounts recorded for acquisition related obligations in  we recorded million as an adjustment to purchased research and development  million as an adjustment to other identifiable intangible asset categories  net of the related deferred tax liabilities  and we recorded the remainder as an adjustment to goodwill 
certain earn out payments are based on multiples of the acquired company s revenue during the earn out period and  consequently  we cannot currently determine the total payments 
however  we have developed an estimate of the maximum potential contingent consideration for each of our acquisitions with an outstanding earn out obligation 
at december   the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration undiscounted that we could be required to make associated with our business combinations is approximately billion  some of which may be payable in our common stock 
the milestones associated with the contingent consideration must be reached in certain future periods ranging from through the estimated cumulative specified revenue level associated with these maximum future contingent payments is approximately billion 
since it is not possible to estimate when the acquired companies will reach their performance milestones or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues  the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above 
further  during  we expect to exercise our options to purchase certain strategic alliances for approximately million  some of which may be payable in our common stock 

table of contents critical accounting policies we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
we describe these accounting polices in note a of our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
these estimates are considered critical if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas that we consider to be critical revenue recognition our revenue primarily consists of the sale of single use disposable medical devices 
revenue is considered to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor  unless a consignment arrangement exists 
we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage  which indicates that the sale is complete 
we generally allow our customers to return defective or damaged products for credit 
our estimate for sales returns is based upon contractual commitments and historical trends and is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
we offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers 
we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue  with the corresponding liability being classified as current 
we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information that can be used to predict the volume of expected future rebates 
if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably  we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered 
inventories we state inventories at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
our provisions for excess or expired inventory are primarily based on management s estimates of forecasted net sales levels 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future 
we record provisions for inventory located in our manufacturing and distribution facilities as cost of sales 
valuation of business combinations we record intangible assets acquired in a business combination under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets  including purchased research and development 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill 
the use of alternative purchase price allocations and alternative estimated useful lives could result in different intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods 
the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region 
we expense the value attributable to these projects in conjunction with the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects 
we use the income approach to establish the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach establishes fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of 
table of contents the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
for the in process projects we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions  we used the following risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows in  percent to percent  in  percent  and in  percent to percent 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets we record intangible assets at historical cost 
we amortize our intangible assets subject to amortization  including patents  licenses  developed technology and core technology  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we review these intangible assets at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 
we also review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of our assets and comparing the calculated fair values to the related carrying values 
we test goodwill during the second quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the test  we calculate the fair value of the reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates 
we have not recorded impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations 
investments in strategic alliances as of december   we had investments in strategic alliances totaling million 
as of december   we had investments in strategic alliances totaling million 
these assets primarily represent investments in privately held and publicly traded equity securities 
we account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold percent or less of the voting stock 
we account for investments in companies over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method 
our determination of whether we have significant influence over an investment requires judgment 
we regularly review our strategic alliance investments for impairment indicators 
examples of events or circumstances that may indicate that an investment is impaired include a significant deterioration in earnings performance  a significant adverse change in the regulatory  economic or technological environment of an investee  and a significant doubt about an investee s ability to continue as a going concern 
if we determine that impairment exists and it is other than temporary  we will reduce the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value and will recognize an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
our exposure to loss related to our strategic alliances is generally limited to our equity investments  notes receivable and intangible assets associated with these alliances 
as of december   we held investments totaling million in two companies that we accounted for under the equity method 
our ownership percentages in these companies range from approximately percent to percent 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we recognized net deferred tax liabilities aggregating million at december  and net deferred tax assets aggregating million at december  the liabilities relate principally to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and earnings of our non us subsidiaries to be remitted in the future 
the assets relate principally to the establishment of inventory and product related reserves  purchased research and development  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
in light of our historical financial performance  we believe these assets will be substantially recovered 
see note j of our consolidated financial statements for a detailed analysis of our deferred tax positions 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider relevant evidence  both positive and negative  to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years 

table of contents we have provided for income taxes payable related to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that may be repatriated in the foreseeable future 
income taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where such earnings have been permanently reinvested in our foreign operations 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are permanently reinvested in foreign operations 
unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested are  million at december  and  million at december  in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years subject to audit 
stock option modifications during the fourth quarter  we modified certain of our stock option plans  principally for options granted prior to may  to change the definition of retirement to conform to the definition generally used in our stock option plans subsequent to may as a result of these modifications  we recorded a million charge million after tax in the key assumptions in estimating the charge were the anticipated retirement age and the expected exercise patterns for the individuals whose options were modified 
if our assumptions do not approximate actual retirement behavior and exercise activity  we may need to record adjustments through our statements of operations 
legal costs we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings  including intellectual property  breach of contract and product liability suits 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
we accrue costs of settlement  damages and  under certain conditions  costs of defense when such costs are probable and estimable 
otherwise  these costs are expensed as incurred 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
our accrual for regulatory and litigation related costs that were probable and estimable was million at december  and million at december  see further discussion of our legal proceedings in item  legal proceedings above 
product liability costs we are substantially self insured with respect to general and product liability claims 
in the normal course of business  product liability claims are asserted against us 
we accrue anticipated costs of litigation and loss for product liability claims based on historical experience  or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable 
we record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable 
our accrual for product liability claims was million at december  and million at december  product liability claims against us will likely be asserted in the future related to events not known to management at the present time 
the absence of significant third party insurance coverage increases our exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions 
however  based on product liability losses experienced in the past  our election to become substantially self insured is not expected to have a material impact on our future operations 
management believes that our risk management practices  including limited insurance coverage  are reasonably adequate to protect us against anticipated general and product liability losses 
however  unanticipated catastrophic losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
new accounting standard on december   the fasb issued statement no

 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
in general  statement no 
r contains similar accounting concepts as those described in statement no 
however  statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we expect to adopt statement no 
r when it becomes effective as of july  statement no 
r permits public companies to adopt the new requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in that compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date of statement no 
r and b based on the requirements of statement no 
for all awards granted to employees before july  that remain unvested as of july  
table of contents a modified retrospective method that includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a for all prior periods presented or b for prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are currently evaluating which method we will use to adopt the requirements of statement no 
r 
as permitted by statement no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options  except as disclosed in note m of our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method will impact our statements of operations 
the impact of adoption of statement no 
r cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future and the method used to value such awards 
however  had we adopted statement no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in our disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
statement no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under currently effective accounting literature 
this requirement will reduce our net operating cash flows and increase our net financing cash flows in periods after our adoption of statement no 
r 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows we recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was million in  million in and million in management s report on internal control over financial reporting as the management of boston scientific corporation  we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
we designed our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements 
we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control integrated framework 
based on our assessment  we believe that  as of december   our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria 
ernst young llp  an independent registered public accounting firm  has issued an audit report on management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting

best president and executive vice president and chief executive officer chief financial officer report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting the board of directors and stockholders of boston scientific corporation we have audited management s assessment  included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting  that boston scientific corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria 
boston scientific corporation s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over 
table of contents financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  evaluating management s assessment  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  management s assessment that boston scientific corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   is fairly stated  in all material respects  based on the coso criteria 
also  in our opinion  boston scientific corporation maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on the coso criteria 
we also have audited  in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  the consolidated balance sheets of boston scientific corporation as of december  and and the related consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december  of boston scientific corporation and our report dated march   expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop  manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures 
furthermore  we manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by monitoring outstanding positions 
our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments  forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries 
we use both nonderivative primarily foreign currency denominated borrowings and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
we had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the notional amount of  million at december  and  million at december  the increase is due to hedging forecasted increases in earnings and cash flows denominated primarily in japanese yen and euro and to changes in our japanese subsidiary structure 
we recorded million of other assets and million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at december  as compared to million of other assets and million of other liabilities recorded at december  a percent appreciation in the us dollar s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by million at december  
table of contents and by million at december  a percent depreciation in the us dollar s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by million at december  and by million at december  any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset  liability or cash flow 
our earnings and cash flow exposure to interest rate changes on us dollar and japanese yen denominated debt is partially offset by interest rate changes on us dollar denominated cash investments 
we use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting floating rate debt into fixed rate debt or fixed rate debt into floating rate debt 
we had interest rate derivative instruments outstanding in the notional amount of  million at december  and million at december  we recorded million of other assets and million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at december  as compared to an immaterial amount at december  a one percent increase in global interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by million at december  as compared to million at december  a one percent decrease in global interest rates would increase the derivative instruments fair value by million at december  as compared to million at december  any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying liability in item above
