item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatements on december   the audit committee of the board of directors of the company and management of the company concluded that the company s financial statements for the fiscal years ended september  and and for the quarters ended december   march  and june   will be restated and such financial statements should no longer be relied upon 
the restatements cover three primary areas 
first  the company previously reported two operating segments wireless infrastructure and satellite communications 
following management s review of the aggregation criteria for combining certain product business units into one reporting segment as provided for in statement of financial accounting standard no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  management determined to begin reporting in five operating segments antenna and cable products  base station subsystems  network solutions  wireless innovations and satellite communications commencing with the financial statements for the fiscal year ended september  the company s segment disclosure included in notes  segment and geographic information  and  selected quarterly financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements reflects the revised reportable segments for all periods presented 
in addition  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflect the revised reportable segments for all periods presented 
second  revenues for fiscal and have been restated based on an analysis the company completed of a contract for the sale of geolocation products acquired from allen telecom in management determined that sop  software revenue recognition  should have been applied since the inception of this contract in  that revenue for certain services that had been completed as of the acquisition date should have been recognized by allen telecom  and that revenue for certain post acquisition services should have been recognized in earlier periods as performed 
the company s disclosure included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact of this restatement on the company s reported results for fiscal and in addition  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the restatement for all periods presented 
finally  a million product recall charge originally recorded by the company in the second quarter of fiscal has been restated to the first quarter of fiscal  as management has concluded that the conditions which gave rise to the charge existed as of december  the company s disclosure included in note  selected quarterly financial information  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact of this restatement on the company s reported results for the first and second quarters of fiscal sales for were billion  up  or million  from the sales increase was driven by a  or million  increase in sales to the wireless infrastructure market partially offset by a  or million  decrease in satellite communications sales 
sales in were billion  up or million  compared to  due primarily to the full year impact of the acquisition of allen telecom and strong growth in wireless infrastructure sales 
wireless infrastructure capital investment grew significantly in and continued to grow moderately in the fundamental drivers of wireless infrastructure growth include increased minutes of usage  increased use of data applications and the global growth of wireless subscribers have continued to drive capital investment in wireless networks 
overview over the last three years the company s product offering has evolved and andrew has developed from primarily a passive component subsystem supplier into a full system integrated product supplier 
with this change in product offering andrew s gross profit margins have decreased over the last three years 
gross profit margins decreased from in to in due principally to changing product mix  changing market conditions and start up costs associated with new manufacturing facilities 
despite significant improvements from new manufacturing facilities and other cost reduction programs  the gross profit percentage declined to in due primarily to higher commodity costs and higher warranty costs 
operating expense as a percentage of sales has declined over the last three years 
research and development  and sales and administrative costs have declined as a percentage of sales from in to in and in andrew believes it will be able to further lower operating costs as a percentage of sales by continuing to leverage its global operations and shared services operating model 
increased sales and operating efficiencies helped to offset lower gross margins  as diluted earnings per share increased from in  to in and in 
table of contents in  the company aligned its product groups  internal reporting structure and management reporting into five operating segments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
these five product groups antenna and cable products  base station subsystems  network solutions  wireless innovations and satellite communications are now managed as separate reportable segments 
sales for andrew s five operating segments for the last three fiscal years were as follows sales by segment dollars in millions change change change antenna and cable products base station subsystems network solutions na wireless innovations satellite communications total sales in  antenna and cable products sales were  million  an increase of from  due to growth in all geographic markets 
the largest increase was in north america due to the acquisition of atc tower services  and growth in base station coaxial cable supporting network upgrades and expansion 
in the first quarter of  andrew acquired atc tower services  inc a division of american tower corporation that provides cell site installation services to wireless operators in north america 
this new construction services business allows andrew to offer a more complete product offering and serves as an additional distribution channel 
further growth in antenna and cable products sales was also due to growth in emerging markets  especially india and eastern europe 
in  antenna and cable products sales increased due to strong global growth of wireless infrastructure investment and the impact of the allen telecom acquisition  which significantly increased the base station antenna product offering 
base station subsystems sales were million in  down from  primarily due to lower power amplifier sales as a result of a decline in global cdma network upgrades and expansion 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in the company s oem customer base and new product offerings  including tower mounted amplifiers and multi carrier power amplifiers 
in  base station subsystems sales more then doubled due to the addition of allen telecom s filter products and increased oem sales to support network capacity and upgrades 
network solutions sales were million in  down from  due to an anticipated reduction of new geolocation hardware installations 
in the third quarter  andrew was notified by cingular wireless that the combined company of at t wireless and cingular wireless had chosen a competitive solution for future e geolocation hardware 
the company believes that this decision may have been influenced by acquisition related factors  more so than technology or performance issues 
the company anticipates that sales of geolocation products will continue to decline in fiscal when ongoing maintenance and support  tier ii and tier iii operators  and international opportunities are expected to account for the majority of geolocation product sales 
network solutions sales increased over in due to the allen telecom acquisition 
wireless innovations sales were million in  up from  due to increased demand for products that support greater coverage and dense urban distribution of rf radio frequency signals 
wireless innovations sales increased in due primarily to the full year impact of sales from the allen telecom acquisition 
andrew anticipates that demand for universal coverage combined with new g applications will continue to generate growth in wireless innovation sales 
satellite communications sales decreased in  as a result of lower sales to the consumer satellite market 
in  andrew had significant sales to the consumer satellite market as a result of its first quarter acquisition of channel master llc  a manufacturer of antenna related products for the consumer satellite market 
the top customers accounted for of sales in both and  and of sales in in  major oems accounted for of sales 
cingular wireless accounted for of total sales and was the only customer that accounted for or more of andrew s sales 

table of contents sales by major geographic region dollars in millions change change change americas europe  middle east  africa emea asia pacific total sales sales in the americas were up in due to modest growth in wireless infrastructure sales and andrew s new construction services business 
partially offsetting this growth was a significant decline in consumer broadband satellite sales and a decline in geolocation sales 
in  sales in the americas increased due to the allen telecom acquisition  strong wireless infrastructure sales and an increase in consumer satellite sales 
sales to europe  middle east  africa emea increased in due to strong wireless infrastructure sales 
the majority of emea sales are to the western european market  which has experienced two consecutive years of solid growth as operators continue to expand and upgrade their networks from g to g 
in  andrew also experienced good growth in emerging markets of russia and other eastern european countries 
in  emea sales increased due to strong wireless infrastructure sales and the impact of the allen telecom acquisition 
asia pacific sales decreased in due to a decline in sales in china  partially offset by continued growth in india 
with the anticipation of the issuance of g licenses in  chinese operators slowed their investment in wireless infrastructure in with the planned issuance of chinese g licenses  andrew anticipates spending will resume in in  the asia pacific region  excluding china  grew from fiscal  due primarily to network expansion in india and taiwan 
andrew has experienced two consecutive years of solid growth in india and believes this emerging market will continue to grow in the future 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  in  and in two of the more significant factors driving this decrease were andrew s changing product mix and changing market factors 
over the last three years  andrew s gross profit percentages have changed as andrew s product offering has evolved from primarily passive components to complete system solutions including more active electronic components 
other major factors that have contributed to this decline are continued decreases in cable prices  higher commodity prices and higher warranty costs associated with the increase in active components 
in the last three years  andrew has seen significant fluctuations in new lower margin products and services  such as consumer satellite products and construction services  which have put downward pressure on gross profit percentages 
in  in addition to a major change in product mix  start up costs for new manufacturing facilities in mexico and the czech republic and the increase in consumer satellite product sales contributed to the decrease in gross profit margin 
despite significant improvements from new manufacturing facilities and other cost improvements  the gross profit margin decreased to in primarily due to higher commodity costs  principally copper  and product recall costs 
in  andrew used approximately million pounds of copper and andrew s average cost per pound of copper used increased by approximately over  resulting in an increase in cost of products sold of approximately million or of sales 
in addition  product recall costs associated with one of the company s base station subsystem products resulted in a charge of million or of sales 
gross profit margins vary across andrew s operating segments 
generally  network solutions and wireless innovations gross profit percentages are above the corporate average 
both of these product groups saw slight positive margin improvement in and substantial growth in as a result of increased sales due to the allen telecom acquisition 
the antenna and cable products margin rate also exceeds the corporate average  but has declined over the last three years due to competitive market conditions  higher raw material costs and changing product mix 
competitive market conditions have reduced average cable prices each of the last three years 
andrew uses commodities such as copper and petrochemicals in the manufacture of its cable products 
the most significant of these commodities is copper and the price of copper has more than doubled over the last eighteen months 
the company has taken steps to mitigate the impact of rising copper prices by increasing the amount of copper it has under forward purchase contacts 
at the start of fiscal year  andrew had approximately of its forecasted copper requirements for under contract at an average price of per pound compared to the market price of approximately per pound at the end of october additionally  in the fourth quarter 
table of contents of  the company raised its cable prices in an effort to partially offset higher copper prices 
the company s cable sales in international markets  as a percentage of total sales  has increased in both and this has negatively impacted the company s overall gross margins as certain international wireless operators generally use smaller diameter  lower margin cable in their networks 
the acquisition of atc tower services in the first quarter of also adversely impacted this segment s gross margin rate 
andrew s base station subsystems product group is comprised of active components such as filters and power amplifiers that carry a lower gross margin than the overall corporate average 
base station subsystem s product margins declined in and primarily due to increased warranty and product recall costs 
andrew s filter product margins declined in due to a change in filter product mix and costs associated with moving more of andrew s filter production to china 
the company expects to see significant cost savings in the future as a result of moving the majority of its filter manufacturing and component sourcing to china in the company s lowest gross profit margin segment is satellite communications 
the majority of the sales in this segment are lower margin consumer or dth satellite products 
this segment s gross profit was positively impacted in by a decline in sales of lower margin dth consumer satellite products 
research and development expense was of sales in  in  and of sales in total research and development expense decreased in due to andrew s efforts to rationalize and focus its research and development efforts 
in research and development expense increased primarily due to the allen telecom acquisition 
the majority of the company s research and development spending over the last three years has been focused on its active components  especially its base station subsystem products 
andrew has continued to invest heavily in the development of new products and more integrated product offerings 
in the last year andrew has introduced new and innovative products such as remote electrical tilt ret base station antennas  new tower mounted amplifier products and the company s new onebase tm cell extender power amplifier product line 
sales and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was in  in and in in  sales and administrative costs increased from factors causing this increase were additional costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  costs associated with the company s on going global it system implementations and additional legal costs related to the settlement of two legal matters see note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  andrew completed it system implementations at several major locations including forest  virginia  reynosa  mexico  shenzhen  china and buchdorf  germany 
andrew anticipates implementing new it systems in smithfield  north carolina and agrate  italy by the end of calendar sales and administrative expense increased in due primarily to the full year impact of the allen telecom acquisition  increased sales and marketing expenses as a result of higher sales volumes and additional incentive compensation costs 
intangible amortization was million in  million in and million in intangible amortization is primarily due to identifiable intangible assets acquired in the allen telecom acquisition and the acquisition of celiant corporation 
the decrease in intangible amortization in was due to certain intangible assets acquired in these acquisitions becoming fully amortized 
the increase in intangible amortization in was due almost entirely to intangible assets acquired in the allen telecom acquisition 
excluding any new acquisitions  andrew expects that intangible amortization will decrease to approximately million in as more intangible assets become fully amortized 
restructuring expense was million in  million in and million in these costs are primarily severance and other costs associated with integrating the operations of allen telecom and andrew  and other cost cutting initiatives 
loss gain on the sale of assets was a loss of million in and million in  and a gain of million in as part of the company s ongoing efforts to rationalize under performing or non strategic assets  the company has completed several asset sales over the last three years 
in  andrew recorded a loss of million from the sale and disposition of certain manufacturing assets 
in  the company recognized a loss on the disposal of assets of million  primarily due to the sale of two product lines 
the company sold selected assets from its broadcast manufacturing operations and wrote down selected assets of its mobile antenna product line to fair value  which were subsequently sold in october in  the company recognized a gain of million from the sale of assets  due to gains on the sale of unimproved land in orland park  illinois and from the sale of the company s denton  texas manufacturing facility 

table of contents operating income was million in  million in  and million in andrew s management uses operating income as its internal measurement of segment profit and loss 
operating income loss by operating segment for the last three years is as follows operating income loss dollars in millions antenna and cable products base station subsystems network solutions wireless innovations satellite communications group items not included in segments unallocated sales and administrative costs intangible amortization gain loss on sale of assets total operating income for internal management purposes andrew does not allocate costs that benefit more than one operating segment 
costs such as finance  accounting  human resources  information systems  legal and executive management are not allocated to operating segments 
the only sales and administrative expense that is allocated to operating segments is the cost of andrew s global sales force  which sells all of andrew s products 
antenna and cable product s operating income has increased over the last three years due to sales growth partially offset by declining gross profit margins 
in  base station subsystems bssg operating loss decreased primarily due to increased revenues 
in  bssg operating loss increased as a result of higher warranty costs  a decrease in filter margins and costs associated with moving filter production to china 
network solutions operating income grew in as geolocation sales increased  but declined in as geolocation sales declined 
wireless innovations operating income has steadily grown as this segment s sales have grown over the last three years 
satellite communications losses increased in due to increased sales of low margin dth products and  in  operating losses declined as sales of dth products decreased 
unallocated sales and administrative costs increased significantly in as a result of the allen telecom acquisition  and decreased slightly in due to improved operating efficiencies and partially offset by costs associated with global it deployments and sarbanes oxley compliance 
sales and administrative costs have increased in total  but have decreased significantly as a percentage of sales from in  to of sales in and other expense is primarily made up of interest expense  interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses 
other expense was million in both and  and was million in interest expense was million in both and  and million in the largest portion of the company s interest expense  and the cause of the increase  is the million of convertible notes issued in august and the long term debt assumed from allen telecom 
interest income was million in  million in and million in interest income in includes million of interest received from a favorable resolution of certain tax related matters 
other expense income was million in  million in and income of million in the majority of other expense income net is foreign exchange gains and losses 
the foreign exchange losses in were primarily due to movements in asian currencies and the euro 
the chinese government adjusted the yuan s exchange rate in  which had previously been fixed to the us dollar  thus creating foreign exchange losses for the company s chinese subsidiaries with us dollar denominated assets 
in  the weakening of the us dollar against major currencies  primarily the euro  generated foreign exchange losses for the company s foreign subsidiaries holding us dollar denominated assets 
income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations was in  in and in income tax expense for includes a million benefit for the reversal of previously accrued taxes resulting from a favorable resolution of certain tax related matters  and a million charge due to a recent change in ohio state tax legislation which limits andrew s ability to realize previously recorded deferred tax assets related to ohio state tax carryforwards 
excluding these items  income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income was in the effective tax rate for was higher than the statutory rate due to a geographic mix shift of earnings and the establishment of valuation allowances for tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain states and foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate for was lower than the statutory rate due to the favorable impact of foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates and the 
table of contents resolution of certain tax matters 
the lower effective tax rate in also reflects benefits related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and significantly higher benefits related to export sales 
the company expects the effective tax rate for to be approximately 
this rate could be materially affected by the impact of earnings mix in foreign countries where the statutory rates are higher or lower than the federal statutory rate  by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws 
the company is subject to examination of its tax filings by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
the company regularly reviews and assesses the potential outcome of these examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax provisions 
as of september   the company has a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  primarily attributable to us net operating losses carried forward  which will begin to expire in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recoverability of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon the company s ability to generate future taxable profits in the united states 
the company regularly reviews and assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax asset and it is the company s current opinion that the net deferred tax asset is fully recoverable 
should the company subsequently determine it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will not be realized  the company would be required to record a valuation allowance against some portion or all of the deferred tax asset at that time 
recording of a valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact upon the company s effective tax rate and reported financial results 
the recently enacted american jobs creation act of provides a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad 
the repatriation of income from the company s foreign subsidiaries could significantly impact the company s effective tax rate 
the company has not yet determined whether  or to what extent  it would repatriate unremitted foreign earnings 
discontinued operations resulted in a loss from operations of million in the company discontinued three non strategic businesses  closing its satellite modem business in and selling its shelter and wireless accessories businesses in net income available to common shareholders includes preferred stock dividends of million in  million in and million in as part of the allen telecom acquisition  the company issued shares of convertible preferred stock  issuing one share for each share of allen telecom convertible preferred stock

liquidity in  andrew maintained its strong balance sheet and increased its cash flow from operations by million or from cash and cash equivalents were million at september   unchanged from september  working capital was million at september   compared to million at september  in  andrew entered into a new million revolving credit agreement that expires in discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the company filed a universal s shelf registration that allows the company to publicly issue up to million of debt or equity 
this shelf registration gives the company the flexibility to take advantage of strategic initiatives and other favorable long term opportunities to enhance liquidity 
management believes that the company s strong working capital position  ability to generate cash flow from operations  and ability to borrow under its revolving credit agreement will allow the company to meet its normal operating cash flow needs for the foreseeable future 
net cash from operations was million in  million in and million in in  improved working capital management resulted in increased cash flow from operations 
the decrease in cash from operations in compared with was due to working capital needs  specifically increased inventory levels and accounts receivable  to support the significant increase in sales in 
table of contents in  cash flow from operations was the result of net income of million  million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  a non cash loss on the sale of assets of million  a million non cash charge for deferred income taxes  cash restructuring costs of million  and a net change in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a million decrease in cash flow 
increased sales and days sales outstanding dso resulted in an increase in accounts receivable  reducing cash flow by million 
dso was days at september   unchanged from days at september   and decreased compared to days at september  fluctuations in dsos are primarily a result of the mix of international sales  which generally carry longer payment terms than domestic sales 
to meet increased sales levels  the company increased inventory resulting in a million decrease in cash flow 
higher accounts payable and other liabilities increased cash flow by million 
in  cash flow from operations was the result of net income of million  million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  a non cash loss on the sale of assets of million  a million non cash charge for deferred income taxes  cash restructuring costs of million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in an million decrease in cash flow

net cash used for investing activities was million in and million in in  andrew generated million from investing activities due primarily to million of cash acquired from the all stock acquisition of allen telecom 
andrew spent million on capital expenditures in  compared to million in and million in the increase in was due primarily to investment in new manufacturing facilities in mexico and the czech republic  and expenditures to improve and integrate allen telecom s manufacturing and it systems 
capital expenditures declined in  primarily due to the completion of the mexico and czech republic facilities early in the year 
in andrew spent million on acquisitions

the total cost of this settlement was million  which included cash payments of million and one million warrants that allow the purchase of one million shares of the company s common stock for a share 
this settlement was accounted for as an increase in liabilities assumed from allen telecom 
in  the company invested million in two strategic investments in the form of convertible interest bearing notes that allow the company to convert these notes into an equity interest in these companies 
the company invested in andes industries  a distributor and manufacturer of high performance optical equipment and other products for broadband cable networks

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the first footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies describes the major accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  sales returns  inventory reserves  revenue recognition  warranty costs  depreciation and amortization  goodwill and intangible impairments  contingencies  taxes  pension liabilities  and restructuring and merger integration costs 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
a material change in these or other estimates could potentially have a material impact on results of operations 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates revenue recognition during  approximately of the company s total revenue was recognized when products were shipped and title passed  based on statement of position  software revenue recognition  based on emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  based on percentage of completion and based on when services are performed 
the company s geolocation product line  which is generally sold as a bundled product offering that includes software  hardware and services  accounted for approximately of the company s revenue for fiscal revenue for geolocation products is recognized pursuant to the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
the fair value of each element is determined based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value determined by stand alone pricing of each element 
these contracts typically contain post contract support pcs services which are sold both as part of a bundled product offering and as a separate contract 
revenue for pcs services is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs contract 
revenue for certain of the company s products is based on multiple element contracts 
revenue recognized for multiple element contracts represented approximately of the company s revenue for fiscal for multiple element contracts as defined by emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables revenue is 
table of contents recognized when the following criteria are met for each element persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and acceptance is determinable  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
the fair value of these elements is based on negotiated contracts and stand alone pricing for each element 
in november  the company acquired selected assets of atc tower services  inc  a division of american tower corporation that provides site installation services to wireless operators in north america 
revenue for the company s construction service business is recognized under the percentage of completion method on the basis of physical completion to date and represents approximately of the company s revenue for fiscal revisions in estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the period in which the facts that require the revision become known 
at the time a loss on a contract is known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is accrued 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the company s assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable 
although management believes that the current allowance is sufficient to cover existing exposures  there can be no assurance against the deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or against defaults that are higher than what has been experienced historically 
if our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us are overstated  it could have an adverse impact on results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory obsolescence reserves are maintained based on management s estimates  historical experience and forecasted demand for the company s products 
a material change in these estimates could adversely impact gross profit 
at september   the company s inventories were stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
at september   inventories stated under the last in  first out lifo method represented of total inventories 
effective july   the company valued all inventory under the fifo method 
the fifo method is preferable because it results in a more meaningful and understandable presentation of financial position to the users of the company s financial statements and conforms the accounting for all inventories to a single method 
in addition  the company has experienced deflation in its annual lifo index for many years and does not expect significant price increases in the foreseeable future 
the fifo method also results in improved reporting of operating cash flows by eliminating the non cash effects of the lifo method 
the accounting change was not material to the financial statements for any of the periods presented and accordingly  no retroactive statement of prior years financial statements was made 
warranty costs the company offers warranties on most of its products 
the specific terms and conditions of the warranties offered by the company vary depending upon the products sold 
the company accrues for warranty costs based on the number of units sold  the type of products sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim 
the company regularly reviews these forecasts and makes adjustments as needed 
in general over the past three years  the company s warranty costs have increased as a percentage of sales as the company s sales mix includes a higher rate of active electronic products 
if the company were to experience an increase in warranty claims compared with the company s historical experience  gross profit could be adversely affected 
goodwill the company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill on the first day of the company s fiscal fourth quarter 
in  the company managed its business as five operating segments 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company tested each operating segment for possible goodwill impairment by comparing each segment s net book value to fair value 
as each operating segment s fair value was greater than its net book value and no other impairment indicators existed  further impairment tests were not deemed necessary and no impairment loss was recorded 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses for the purpose of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
if actual results are different from the company s forecasts  future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill  which could result in non cash charges  adversely affecting the company s results of operations 

table of contents the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of its operating segments based on a one percentage point increase in discount rates  which ranged from to in the annual impairment test 
based on this sensitivity analysis  step two testing in accordance with sfas no 
would not be required for any of the five operating segments 
however  as a result of its relatively large amount of goodwill and its operating losses in  and  the base station subsystem group s goodwill is at a higher risk of potential future impairment 
income taxes the company s balance sheet reflects significant deferred tax assets  primarily related to net operating losses and tax credits carried forward 
to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize certain deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  the company is required to establish valuation allowances against that portion of the deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances have been established for the portion of deferred tax assets representing tax credits carried forward and certain state and foreign losses carried forward 
no valuation allowances have been established for the remainder of the deferred tax asset balances  as management expects the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the realization of higher taxable profits in the united states and the utilization of tax planning strategies will make the realization of such deferred tax assets more likely than not 
the determination of required valuation allowances involves significant management judgments and is based upon the company s best estimates of anticipated taxable profits in the various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated 
the company currently anticipates that it will be required to earn taxable profits of approximately million in the united states and approximately million in various foreign jurisdictions in order to fully utilize all deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets are primarily related to certain us and foreign tax attributes which will begin to expire in see note income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
changes in expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to the company s provision for income taxes 
restructuring at september   the company had a restructuring reserve of million for the integration of allen telecom and channel master operations and for the completion of its restructuring plan 
these accruals are based on the company s best estimate of the costs associated with merger integration and restructuring plans  including employee termination costs  lease cancellations  and other costs

these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest costs  expected compensation increases  benefits earned  mortality rates  and other factors 
if actual results are significantly different than those forecasted or if future changes are made to these assumptions  the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
the discount rate enables management to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the company estimates that a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased benefit expense in by million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased benefit expense in by million 
to determine the expected return on plan assets  management considers the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical returns on plan assets 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on pension plan assets would have decreased or increased pension expense in by million
