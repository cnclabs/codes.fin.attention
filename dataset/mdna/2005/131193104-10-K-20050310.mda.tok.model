 against dunlop slazenger group americas  inc  d b a maxfli maxfli  for infringement of a golf ball aerodynamics patent owned by the company  us patent no 
 the aerodynamics patent 
the company later amended its complaint to add a claim that maxfli engaged in false advertising by claiming that its a golf balls were the longest ball on tour 
maxfli answered the complaint denying patent infringement and false advertising  and also filed a counterclaim asserting that former maxfli employees hired by the company had disclosed confidential maxfli trade secrets to the company  and that the company had used that information to enter the golf ball business 
in the counterclaim  maxfli sought compensatory damages of million  punitive damages equal to two times the compensatory damages  prejudgment interest  attorneys fees  a declaratory judgment  and injunctive relief

in post trial motions  callaway golf is seeking attorneys fees and prejudgment interest on its successful false advertising claim  while maxfli is seeking attorneys fees on the dismissal of the patent infringement claims filed by callaway golf 
it is expected that if maxfli is ultimately unsuccessful with its post trial motions  it will appeal the verdict 
if maxfli is successful with its post trial motions  or an appeal of the verdict  and maxfli s counterclaims are ultimately resolved in maxfli s favor  such matters could have a significant adverse effect upon the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to investors that appear elsewhere in this report 
regulation g disclosure the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity set forth in this item have been derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
in addition to the gaap results of operations  the company has also provided additional information concerning the company s results that includes certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with gaap 
the non gaap financial measures included in this discussion are pro forma gross profit  net income and earnings per share amounts that exclude from charges associated with the integration of the top flite business and from the adjustment to the company s warranty reserve 
these non gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures may also be inconsistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies 
management believes that the presentation of such non gaap financial measures  when considered in conjunction with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures  provides useful information to investors by permitting additional relevant period over period comparisons of the historical operations of the callaway golf business 
the company has included in this discussion supplemental information which reconciles those non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available 

table of contents management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition sales are recognized when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
sales are recorded net of an allowance for sales returns and sales programs 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings 
sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program  management s forecast of future product demand  and historical customer participation in similar programs 
if the actual costs of sales returns and sales programs significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be significantly adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends  all of which are subject to change 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the inventory balance  which includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand  all of which are subject to change 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly adversely affected 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
warranty the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its golf clubs  although the company s historical practice has been to honor warranty claims well after the two year stated warranty period 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty 
table of contents claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly adversely affected 
taxes current income tax expense benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences resulting from temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company is required to file federal and state tax returns in the united states and various other tax returns in foreign jurisdictions 
the preparation of these tax returns requires the company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions  which could affect the amount of tax paid by the company 
the company  in consultation with its tax advisors  bases its tax returns on interpretations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the tax returns  however  are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company files its returns 
as part of these reviews  a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the interpretations the company used to calculate its tax liability and therefore require the company to pay additional taxes 
as required under applicable accounting rules  the company therefore accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability the company could incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of disagreements with the various taxing authorities 
the tax contingency accrual is recorded as a component of the company s net income taxes payable receivable balance  which the company reviews and updates over time as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  completion of tax audits or upon occurrence of other events 
change in accounting estimate as discussed above  the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its golf clubs  although the company s historical practice has been to honor warranty claims well after the two year stated warranty period 
prior to the third quarter of  the company s method of estimating both its implicit and explicit warranty obligation was to utilize data and information based on the cumulative failure rate by product after taking into consideration specific risks the company believes existed at the time the financial statements were prepared 
these additional risks included product specific risks  such as the introduction of products with new technology or materials that would be more susceptible to failure or breakage  and other business risks  such as increased warranty liability as a result of acquisitions 
in many cases  additions to the warranty reserve for new product introductions have been based on management s judgment of possible future claims derived from the limited product failure data that was available at the time 
beginning in the second quarter of  the company began to compile data that illustrated the timing of warranty claims in relation to product life cycles 
in the third quarter of  the company determined it had gathered sufficient data and concluded it should enhance its warranty accrual estimation methodology to utilize the additional data 
the analysis of the data  in management s judgment  provided management with more insight into timing of claims and demonstrated that some product failures are more likely to occur early in a product s life cycle while other product failures occur in a more linear fashion over the product s life cycle 
as a result of its analysis of the additional information  the company believes it has gained better insight and improved judgment to more accurately project the ultimate failure rates of its products 
as a result of this refinement in its methodology  the company concluded that it should change its methodology of estimating warranty accruals and reduce its warranty reserve by approximately million 
the million reduction is recorded in cost of sales and favorably impacted gross profit as a percentage of net sales by two percentage 
table of contents points for the year ended december  the change in methodology has been accounted for as a change in accounting principle inseparable from a change in estimate 
in connection with regulation g  the company provides the following table which summarizes what net income and earnings per share would have been had the warranty reserve adjustment  adjusted for taxes  been excluded from reported results and reconciles such non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in millions  except per share data year ended december  reported net income non cash warranty reserve adjustment  net of tax pro forma net income basic earnings per share reported net income non cash warranty reserve adjustment  net of tax pro forma basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share reported net income non cash warranty reserve adjustment  net of tax pro forma diluted earnings per share recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by this reference

certain factors affecting callaway golf company the financial statements contained in this report and the related discussion describe and analyze the company s financial performance and condition for the periods presented 
for the most part  this information is historical 
the company s prior results  however  are not necessarily indicative of the company s future performance or financial condition 
the company has also included certain forward looking statements concerning the company s future performance or financial condition 
these forward looking statements are based upon current information and expectations and actual results could differ materially 
the company therefore has included the following discussion of certain factors that could cause the company s future performance or financial condition to differ materially from its prior performance or financial condition or from management s expectations or estimates of the company s future performance or financial condition 
these factors  among others  should be considered in assessing the company s future prospects and prior to making an investment decision with respect to the company s stock 
market acceptance of products a golf equipment manufacturer s ability to compete is in part dependent upon its ability to satisfy the various subjective requirements of golfers  including a golf club s and golf ball s look and feel  and the level of acceptance that a golf club and ball has among professional and recreational golfers 
the subjective preferences of golf club and golf ball purchasers are difficult to predict and may be subject to rapid and unanticipated changes 
in addition  the company s products have tended to incorporate significant innovations in design and manufacture  which have often  but not always  resulted in higher prices for the company s products relative to other products in the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that a significant percentage of the public will always be willing to pay premium prices for golf equipment or that the company will be able to design and manufacture products that achieve market acceptance 
in general  there can be no assurance as to whether or how long the company s golf clubs and golf balls will achieve and maintain market acceptance and therefore there can be no assurance that the demand for the company s products will permit the company to experience growth in sales  or maintain historical levels of sales  in the future 
new product introduction and product cyclicality the company believes that the introduction of new  innovative golf clubs and golf balls is important to its future success 
a major portion of the company s revenues is generated by products that are less than two years old 
the company faces certain risks associated with such a strategy 
for example  in the golf industry  new models and basic design changes in golf equipment are frequently met with consumer rejection 
in 
table of contents addition  prior successful designs have been rendered obsolete within a relatively short period of time as new products are introduced into the marketplace 
further  any new products that retail at a lower price than prior products may negatively impact the company s revenues unless unit sales increase 
the rapid introduction of new golf club or golf ball products by the company has resulted in close outs of existing inventories at both the wholesale and retail levels 
such close outs have resulted in reduced margins on the sale of older products  as well as reduced sales of new products  given the availability of older products at lower prices 
the company s newly introduced golf club products generally  but not always  have a product life cycle of up to two years 
these products generally sell significantly better in the first year after introduction as compared to the second year 
in certain markets  such as japan  the decline in sales occurs sooner in the product cycle and is more significant 
the company s fusion woods generally sell at higher price points than its titanium metal woods  and its titanium metal woods generally sell at higher price points than its steel metal woods 
historically  the company s wood products generally have achieved better gross margins than its iron products 
however  price compression in the woods market has made this differential less  and at times gross margins on woods may be less than other products 
the company s sales and gross margins for a particular period may be negatively or positively affected by the mix of new products sold in such period 
manufacturing capacity the company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products 
the nature of the company s business makes it difficult to quickly adjust its manufacturing capacity if actual demand for its products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand 
if actual demand for its products exceeds the forecasted demand  the company may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand  which could limit the company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance 
on the other hand  if actual demand is less than the forecasted demand for its products  this could result in less than optimum capacity usage and or in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the company s financial performance 
dependence on certain suppliers and materials the company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts  some of which are single sourced 
in addition  some of the company s products require specifically developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly 
the company believes that suitable clubheads and shafts could be obtained from other manufacturers in the event its regular suppliers because of financial difficulties or otherwise are unable or fail to provide suitable components 
however  there could be a significant production delay or disruption caused by the inability of current suppliers to deliver or the transition to other suppliers  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company is also single sourced or dependent on a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls 
many of the materials are customized for the company 
any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact upon the company s golf ball business 
if the company did experience any such delays or interruptions  there is no assurance that the company would be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business 
the company s size has made it a large consumer of certain materials  including steel  titanium alloys  carbon fiber and rubber 
the company does not make these materials itself  and must rely on its ability to obtain adequate supplies in the world marketplace in competition with other users of such materials 
while the company has been successful in obtaining its requirements for such materials thus far  there can be no assurance that it always will be able to do so at a reasonable price 
an interruption in the supply of the materials used by the company or a significant change in costs could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company uses united parcel service ups for substantially all ground shipments of products to its us customers 
the company uses air carriers and shipping services for most of its international shipments of products 
any significant interruption in ups  air carrier or shipping services could have a material adverse 
table of contents effect upon the company s ability to deliver its products to its customers 
if there were any significant interruption in such services  there is no assurance that the company could engage alternative suppliers to deliver its products in a timely and cost efficient manner 
in addition  many of the components the company uses to build its golf clubs  including clubheads and shafts  are shipped to the company via air carrier and ship services 
any significant interruption in ups services  air carrier services or shipping services into or out of the united states could have a material adverse effect upon the company see below international risks 
dependence on energy resources the company s golf club and golf ball manufacturing facilities in california use  among other resources  significant quantities of electricity to operate 
in  some companies in california  including the company  experienced periods of blackouts during which electricity was not available 
if the company were to experience such blackouts again  there is no assurance that it would be able to obtain alternative power supplies at reasonable prices 
an interruption in the supply of electricity or a significant increase in the cost of electricity could have a significant adverse effect upon the company s results of operations 
competition golf clubs 
the golf club business is highly competitive  and is served by a number of well established and well financed companies with recognized brand names  as well as new companies with popular products 
new product introductions  price reductions  consignment sales  extended payment terms  close outs including close outs of products that were recently commercially successful and increased tour and advertising spending by competitors continue to generate increased market competition 
furthermore  continued price compression in the club industry for new clubs could have a significant adverse affect on the company s pre owned club business as the gap between the cost of a new club and a pre owned club lessens 
there can be no assurance that successful marketing activities  discounted pricing  consignment sales  extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors will not negatively impact the company s future sales 
golf balls 
the golf ball business is also highly competitive and may be becoming even more competitive 
there are a number of well established and well financed competitors  including one competitor with an estimated us market share of approximately 
as competition in this business increases  many of these competitors are increasing advertising  tour or other promotional support 
this increased competition has resulted in significant expenses for the company in both tour and advertising support and product development 
unless there is a change in competitive conditions  these competitive pressures and increased costs will continue to adversely affect the profitability of the company s golf ball business 
on a consolidated basis  no one customer that distributes the company s golf clubs or balls in the united states accounted for more than of the company s revenues in  or on a segment basis  the company s golf ball customer base is much more concentrated than its golf club customer base 
in  the top five golf ball customers accounted for approximately of the company s total golf ball sales 
a loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant adverse effect upon the company s golf ball sales 
adverse global economic conditions the company sells golf clubs  golf balls and golf accessories 
these products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers 
consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous 
adverse economic conditions in the united states or in the company s international markets which represent almost half of the company s total sales  or a decrease in prosperity among consumers  or even a decrease in consumer confidence as a result of anticipated adverse economic conditions  could cause consumers to forgo or to postpone purchasing new golf products  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company 

table of contents terrorist activity and armed conflict terrorist activities and armed conflicts in recent years such as the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon  the incidents of anthrax poisoning and the military actions in the middle east  including the war in iraq  as well as the threat of future conflict  have had a significant adverse effect upon the company s business 
any such additional events would likely have an adverse effect upon the world economy and would likely adversely affect the level of demand for the company s products as consumers attention and interest are diverted from golf and become focused on these events and the economic  political  and public safety issues and concerns associated with such events 
also  such events could adversely affect the company s ability to manage its supply and delivery logistics 
if such events caused a significant disruption in domestic or international air  ground or sea shipments  the company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to produce and sell its products and to deliver customer orders also would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  such events can negatively impact tourism  which could adversely affect the company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations 
natural disasters and pandemic diseases the occurrence of a natural disaster  such as an earthquake or hurricane  or the outbreak of a pandemic disease  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or the avian flu  could significantly adversely affect the company s business 
a natural disaster or a pandemic disease could significantly adversely affect both the demand for the company s products as well as the supply of the components used to make the company s products 
demand for golf products could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines 
if the company s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease  the company s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected 
in addition  the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease generally restricts the travel to and from the affected areas  making it more difficult in general to manage the company s international operations 
foreign currency risk a significant portion of the company s sales are international sales 
as a result  the company conducts transactions in approximately currencies worldwide 
conducting business in such various currencies increases the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
the company s financial results are reported in us dollars 
as a result  transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes based upon the applicable foreign currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates therefore may positively or negatively affect the company s reported financial results 
the effect of the translation of foreign currencies on the company s financial results can be significant 
the company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate over time the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on the company s financial results 
the company s hedging activities reduce  but do not eliminate  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
factors that could affect the effectiveness of the company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility  they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar 
for the effect of the company s hedging activities during the current reporting periods  see below quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company s future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the company conducts business 
the degree to which the company s financial results are affected will depend in part upon the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the company s hedging activities 

table of contents in addition  foreign currency fluctuations can also affect the prices at which products are sold in the company s international markets 
the company therefore adjusts its pricing based in part upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
significant unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates make it more difficult for the company to manage pricing in its international markets 
if the company is unable to adjust its pricing in a timely manner to counteract the effects of foreign currency fluctuations  the company s pricing may not be competitive in the marketplace and the company s financial results in its international markets could be adversely affected 
growth opportunities in order for the company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs or golf balls  the company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or balls  or the market for golf clubs or balls must grow 
the company already has a significant share of worldwide golf club sales and the company s golf ball products achieved the number two retail market share in therefore  opportunities for additional market share may be limited 
the company does not believe there has been any material increase in the number of golfers worldwide in over four years 
furthermore  the company believes that overall worldwide golf club sales have generally not experienced substantial growth in the past several years 
there is no assurance that the overall dollar volume of worldwide golf club or ball sales will grow  or that it will not decline  in the future 
seasonality and adverse weather conditions in addition to the effects of product cycles described above  the company s business is also subject to the effects of seasonal fluctuations 
the company s first quarter sales generally represent the company s sell in to the golf retail channel of its golf club products for the new golf season 
orders for many of these sales are received during the fourth quarter of the prior year 
the company s second and third quarter sales generally represent re order business for golf clubs 
sales of golf clubs during the second and third quarters are significantly affected not only by the sell through of the company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell through of the products of the company s competitors 
retailers are sometimes reluctant to re order the company s products in significant quantity when they already have excess inventory of the company s or its competitors products 
the company s sales of golf balls are generally associated with the level of rounds played in the areas where the company s products are sold 
therefore  golf ball sales tend to be greater in the second and third quarters  when the weather is good in most of the company s key markets and rounds played are up 
golf ball sales are also stimulated by product introductions as the retail channel takes on initial supplies 
like golf clubs  re orders of golf balls depend on the rate of sell through 
the company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than the other quarters because in general in many of the company s principal markets less people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather 
furthermore  it previously was the company s practice to announce its new product line at the beginning of each calendar year 
in recent years  the company has departed from that practice and now generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan better 
such early announcements of new products could cause golfers  and therefore the company s customers  to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until the company s new products are available 
such deferments could have a material adverse effect upon sales of the company s current products and or result in close out sales at reduced prices 
because of these seasonal trends  the company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions 
unfavorable weather conditions generally result in less golf rounds played  which generally results in less demand for golf clubs and golf balls 
furthermore  catastrophic storms  such as the hurricanes in florida and along the east coast in late  can negatively affect golf rounds played not only during the storms but also for a significant period of time afterward as storm damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes  businesses and communities 
consequently  sustained adverse weather conditions  especially during the warm weather months  could materially affect the company s sales 

table of contents conformance with the rules of golf new golf club and golf ball products generally seek to satisfy the standards established by the usga and r a because these standards are generally followed by golfers within their respective jurisdictions 
the usga rules are generally followed in the united states  canada and mexico  and the r a rules are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world 
the rules of golf as published by the r a and the usga are virtually the same except with respect to the regulation of driving clubs 
the r a rules currently permit driver clubheads with greater flexibility as measured by a specific test than are permitted under the usga rules 
as a result  in jurisdictions where the r a rules are followed  the company like many of its competitors has marketed and sold drivers that conform to the r a rules but not the usga rules the plus drivers 
in those jurisdictions where the usga rules are followed  the company markets and sells its standard drivers that conform to both the r a and the usga rules 
all of the company s other products are believed to conform to both the usga and r a rules 
effective january   the more flexible clubheads such as those used for the plus drivers will not be conforming under the generally applicable rules of golf as published by the r a 
it is not clear what effect the change in rules will have upon demand for plus drivers in r a jurisdictions as approaches or subsequent to the implementation of the new restrictions 
it is possible that some jurisdictions and or golfers will choose not to follow the r a s changes and will instead continue to use plus drivers 
this uncertainty adversely affects the company s research and development and manufacturing operations which must plan and commit resources years in advance of a new product release 
if the company does not accurately anticipate consumer reaction to the new rule changes  the company s sales in such jurisdictions could be adversely affected and the company could be required to invest significant resources to change its product offerings at such time 
the company also believes that the general confusion created by the ruling bodies of golf as to what is a conforming or non conforming driver and the limits imposed on new driver technology generally have hurt sales of drivers 
there is no assurance that the company s future products will satisfy usga and or r a standards  or that existing usga and or r a standards will not be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the company s products or the company s brand 
if a change in rules were adopted and caused one or more of the company s current products to be non conforming  the company s sales of such products could be adversely affected 
furthermore  any such new rules could restrict the company s ability to develop new products 
golf professional endorsements the company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote callaway golf  odyssey  top flite and ben hogan branded products 
the company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours  including the champions tour  the pga tour  the lpga tour  the pga european tour  the japan golf tour and the nationwide tour 
while most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations  some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments 
if certain of the company s professional endorsers were to stop using the company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements  the company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity or lack of endorsement 
the company believes that professional usage of its golf clubs and golf balls contributes to retail sales 
the company therefore spends a significant amount of money to secure professional usage of its products 
many other companies  however  also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements  including significant cash rewards and specially designed products 
there is a great deal of competition to secure the representation of tour professionals 
as a result  it is becoming increasingly difficult and more expensive to attract and retain such tour professionals 
the inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the company s products by professional golfers or limit the company s ability to attract other tour professionals 
a decline in the level of professional usage of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales and business 

table of contents intellectual property and proprietary rights the golf club industry  in general  has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs 
the company has an active program of enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knock off products  and asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights  patents  trademarks  and trade dress 
however  there is no assurance that these efforts will reduce the level of acceptance obtained by these infringers 
additionally  there can be no assurance that other golf club manufacturers will not be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the company s designs without infringing any of the company s copyrights  patents  trademarks  or trade dress 
an increasing number of the company s competitors have  like the company itself  sought to obtain patent  trademark  copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs and golf balls 
as the company develops new products  it attempts to avoid infringing the valid patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
before introducing new products  the company s legal staff evaluates the patents and other intellectual property rights of others to determine if changes are required to avoid infringing any valid intellectual property rights that could be asserted against the company s new product offerings 
from time to time  others have contacted or may contact the company to claim that they have proprietary rights that have been infringed upon by the company and or its products 
the company evaluates any such claims and  where appropriate  has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements 
to date  there have been no interruptions in the company s business as a result of any claims of infringement 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will not be adversely affected in the future by the assertion of intellectual property rights belonging to others 
this effect could include alteration or withdrawal of existing products and delayed introduction of new products 
various patents have been issued to the company s competitors in the golf ball industry 
as the company develops its golf ball products  it attempts to avoid infringing valid patents or other intellectual property rights 
despite these attempts  it cannot be guaranteed that competitors will not assert and or a court will not find that the company s golf balls infringe certain patent or other rights of competitors 
if the company s golf balls are found to infringe on protected technology  there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain a license to use such technology  and it could incur substantial costs to redesign them and or defend legal actions 
the company has procedures to maintain the secrecy of its confidential business information 
these procedures include criteria for dissemination of information and written confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers 
suppliers  when engaged in joint research projects  are required to enter into additional confidentiality agreements 
while these efforts are taken seriously  there can be no assurance that these measures will prove adequate in all instances to protect the company s confidential information 
the company s code of conduct prohibits misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information of third parties 
the code of conduct is contained in the company s employee handbook and is also available on the company s website 
employees also sign an employee invention and confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information from third parties 
periodic training is provided to employees on this topic as well 
despite taking these steps  as well as others  the company cannot guarantee that these measures will be adequate in all instances to prevent misappropriation of trade secrets from third parties or the accusation by a third party that such misappropriation has taken place 
brand licensing the company licenses its trademarks to third party licensees who produce  market and sell their products bearing the company s trademarks 
the company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products  and on the manner  on which such trademarks may be used 
in addition  the company requires its licensees to abide by certain standards of conduct and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business 
however  if a licensee fails to adhere to these requirements  the company s brand could be damaged by the use or misuse of the company s trademarks in connection with its licensees products 

table of contents product returns golf clubs 
the company supports all of its golf clubs with a limited two year written warranty 
since the company does not rely upon traditional designs in the development of its golf clubs  its products may be more likely to develop unanticipated problems than those of many of its competitors that use traditional designs 
for example  clubs have been returned with cracked clubheads  broken graphite shafts and loose medallions 
while any breakage or warranty problems are deemed significant by the company  the incidence of defective clubs returned to date has not been material in relation to the volume of clubs that have been sold 
the company monitors the level and nature of any golf club breakage and  where appropriate  seeks to incorporate design and production changes to assure its customers of the highest quality available in the market 
significant increases in the incidence of breakage or other product problems may adversely affect the company s sales and image with golfers 
the company believes that it has adequate reserves for warranty claims 
if the company were to experience an unusually high incidence of breakage or other warranty problems in excess of these reserves  the company s financial results would be adversely affected 
see above  critical accounting policies and estimates warranty 
golf balls 
the company has not experienced significant returns of defective golf balls  and in light of the quality control procedures implemented in the production of its golf balls  the company does not expect a significant amount of defective ball returns 
however  if future returns of defective golf balls were significant  it could have a material adverse effect upon the company s golf ball business 
gray market distribution some quantities of the company s products find their way to unapproved outlets or distribution channels 
this gray market for the company s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the company s products  and can injure the company s image in the minds of its customers and consumers 
on the other hand  stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling the company s products to unauthorized distributors and or an increase in sales returns over historical levels 
while the company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of its products in the gray market in both the us and abroad  it has not stopped such commerce 
international risks the company s management believes that controlling the distribution of its products in certain major markets in the world has been and will be an element in the future growth and success of the company 
the company sells and distributes its products directly as opposed to through third party distributors in many key international markets in europe  asia  north america and elsewhere around the world 
these activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory  accounts receivable  employees  corporate infrastructure and facilities 
in addition  there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the united states and the company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the united states 
the operation of foreign distribution in the company s international markets  as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors  will continue to require the dedication of management and other company resources 
as a result of this international business  the company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states 
in addition to foreign currency risks  these risks include i increased difficulty in protecting the company s intellectual property rights and trade secrets  ii unexpected government action or changes in legal or regulatory requirements  iii social  economic or political instability  iv the effects of any anti american sentiments on the company s brands or sales of the company s products  v increased difficulty in controlling and monitoring foreign operations from the united states  including increased difficulty in identifying and recruiting qualified personnel for its foreign operations  and vi increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or shipping services  which interruptions could significantly adversely affect the company s ability to obtain timely delivery of components from international suppliers or to timely deliver its products to international customers 
although the company believes the 
table of contents benefits of conducting business internationally outweigh these risks  any significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect upon the company s operations and therefore financial performance and condition 
credit risk the company primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers directly and through wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries  and to foreign distributors 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers 
historically  the company s bad debt expense has been low 
however  a downturn in the retail golf equipment market could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of the company s significant customers 
a failure by the company s customers to pay a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the company s performance and financial condition 
information systems all of the company s major operations  including manufacturing  distribution  sales and accounting  are dependent upon the company s information computer systems 
the callaway golf business information systems and the acquired top flite information systems are different and the company is therefore currently operating multiple platforms 
the company has made a decision to integrate the systems worldwide 
this large scale project is currently underway 
any significant disruption in the operation of such systems  as a result of an internal system malfunction  infection from an external computer virus  or complications in connection with any attempted integration of the two systems  or otherwise  would have a significant adverse effect upon the company s ability to operate its business 
although the company has taken steps to mitigate the effect of any such disruptions  there is no assurance that such steps would be adequate in a particular situation 
consequently  a significant or extended disruption in the operation of the company s information systems could have a material adverse effect upon the company s operations and therefore financial performance and condition 
change in accounting rules the company currently and historically has accounted for its stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 

under apb no 
 the company is not required to record compensation expense for equity based awards granted to employees 
the financial accounting standards board has recently issued rules which require the company to begin recording compensation expense for such awards based upon the fair value of such awards for all periods beginning after june  such noncash compensation expense is anticipated to have a significant adverse effect upon the company s reported earnings 
although the company has historically provided in the notes to its financial statements pro forma earnings information showing what the company s results would have been had the company been recording compensation expense for such awards  the amount of such expense was not reflected in its financial results 
consequently  when the company begins recording such compensation expense in  the period over period comparisons will be significantly affected by the inclusion of such expense in and the absence of such expense from and prior periods 
if investors do not appropriately consider these changes in accounting rules  the price at which the company s stock is traded could be significantly adversely affected 
analyst guidance  media reports and market volatility the company s stock is traded publicly  principally on the new york stock exchange 
as a result  at any given time  there are usually various securities analysts which follow the company and issue reports on the company 
these reports include information about the company s historical financial results as well as the analysts estimates of the company s future performance 
the analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from the company s own estimates or expectations 
the company has a policy against confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by analysts and any reports issued by such 
table of contents analysts are not the responsibility of the company 
investors should not assume that the company agrees with any report issued by any analyst or with any statements  projections  forecasts or opinions contained in any such report 
in addition to analyst reports  the media also reports its opinion on the company s results 
these media reports are often written quickly so as to be the first to the news wire and in an attempt to garner attention often lead with headlines that are not representative of the substance of the article 
furthermore  these media reports  which are often written by writers who are not financial experts  reflect only the writers views of the company s results 
investors should not assume that the company agrees with such media reports or the manner in which the company s results are presented or characterized in such reports 
the price at which the company s stock is traded on the securities exchanges is based upon many factors 
in the short term  the price at which the company s stock is traded can be significantly affected  positively or negatively  by analysts reports and media reports  regardless of the accuracy of such reports 
over the long term  the price at which the company s stock is traded should tend to reflect the company s performance irrespective of such reports 
the company may from time to time provide investors with estimates of anticipated revenues and earnings per share 
if the company provides such estimates  they will be based upon the information available and management s expectations at the time such estimates are made and actual results could differ materially

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes to limit its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
transactions involving these financial instruments are with credit worthy firms 
the use of these instruments exposes the company to market and credit risk which may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties  although counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk from its credit facility 
foreign currency fluctuations in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks see note to the company s consolidated condensed financial statements that could impact the company s results of operations 
the company s risk management strategy includes the use of derivative financial instruments  including forwards and purchased options  to hedge certain of these exposures 
the company s objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts used to hedge them  thereby reducing volatility of earnings 
the company does not enter into any trading or speculative positions with regard to foreign currency related derivative instruments 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent primarily in its sales commitments  anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company transacts business in currencies worldwide  of which the most significant to its operations are the european currencies  japanese yen  korean won  canadian dollar  and australian dollar 
for most currencies  the company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefits from a weaker us dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the company transacts significant amounts of business 
the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge against exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such contracts are designated at inception to the related foreign currency exposures being hedged  which include anticipated intercompany sales of inventory denominated in foreign currencies  payments due on intercompany transactions from certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  and anticipated sales by the company s wholly owned european subsidiary for certain euro denominated transactions 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in british pounds  euros  japanese yen  korean won  canadian dollars and australian dollars 
to achieve hedge accounting  contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies 
pursuant to its foreign exchange hedging policy  the company may hedge anticipated transactions and the related receivables and payables denominated in foreign 
table of contents currencies using forward foreign currency exchange rate contracts and put or call options 
foreign currency derivatives are used only to meet the company s objectives of minimizing variability in the company s operating results arising from foreign exchange rate movements 
the company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
hedging contracts mature within twelve months from their inception 
at december   and  the notional amounts of the company s foreign exchange contracts were approximately million  million and million respectively 
the company estimates the fair values of derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates  and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
at december   current liabilities related to the fair value of foreign currency related derivatives were million 
there were no current assets related to the fair values of foreign currency related derivatives 
at december   the fair values of foreign currency related derivatives were recorded as current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
at december   and  the notional amounts of the company s foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges were approximately  million and million  respectively 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci as a separate component of shareholders equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized 
during the years ended december  and  no gains or losses were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges 
during the year ended december   gains of million were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss for derivative instruments that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge is immediately reported as a component of interest and other income 
for foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges  hedge effectiveness is measured using the spot rate 
changes in the spot forward differential are excluded from the test of hedging effectiveness and are recorded currently in earnings as a component of interest and other income 
during the years ended december   and  the company recorded a net gain loss of million loss  million gain and million gain  respectively  as a result of changes in the spot forward differential 
assessments of hedge effectiveness are performed using the dollar offset method and applying a hedge effectiveness ratio between and 
given that both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are evaluated using the same spot rate  the company anticipates the hedges to be highly effective
