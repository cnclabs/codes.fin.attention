item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on may  our investment objectives are to achieve a high level of current income by investing in debt securities  consisting primarily of senior notes  senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  of established private businesses that are backed by leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds or others  with a particular emphasis on senior subordinated notes 
in addition  we may acquire existing loans that meet this profile from leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds and others 
we also seek to provide our stockholders with long term capital growth through the appreciation in the value of warrants or other equity instruments that we may receive when we make loans 
we operate as a closed end  non diversified management investment company  and have elected to be treated as a business development company under the act 
we seek out small and medium sized businesses that meet certain criteria  including the potential for growth in cash flow  adequate assets for loan collateral  experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower  profitable operations based on the borrower s cash flow  reasonable capitalization of the borrower usually by leveraged buyout funds or venture capital funds and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position  if any 
we anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the borrower  a public offering by the borrower or by exercise of our right to require the borrower to buy back its warrants 
we lend to borrowers that need funds to finance growth  restructure their balance sheets or effect a change of control 
our loans typically range from million to million  mature in no more than seven years and accrue interest at a fixed or variable rate that exceeds the prime rate 
a number of our loans have a provision that calls for some portion of the interest payments to be deferred and added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid  together with the principal  at maturity 
this form of deferred interest is often called paid in kind or pik interest  and  when earned  we record pik interest as interest income and add the pik interest to the principal balance of the loans 
we seek to avoid pik interest with all potential investments under review 
because our loans will generally be subordinated debt of private companies who typically cannot or will not expend the resources to have their debt securities rated by a credit rating agency  we expect that most  if not all  of the debt securities we acquire will be unrated 
we cannot accurately predict what ratings these loans might receive if they were in fact rated  and therefore we cannot determine whether or not they could be considered to be investment grade quality 
to the extent possible  our loans generally are collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets 
interest payments are generally made monthly or quarterly except to the extent of any pik interest with amortization of principal generally being deferred for several years 
the principal amount of the loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at maturity at five to seven years 
when we receive a warrant to purchase stock in a borrower in connection with a loan  the warrant will typically have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the portfolio company s common stock at the time of the loan and entitle us to purchase a modest percentage of the borrower s stock 
original issue discounts oid arise when we make a loan and receive an equity interest in the borrower at the same time 
to the extent that the price paid for the equity is not at market value  we must allocate part of the price paid for the loan  to the value of the equity 
then the amount allocated to the equity  the oid  must be amortized over the life of the loan 
as with pik interest  the amortization of oid also produces income that must be recognized for purposes of satisfying the distribution requirements for a regulated investment company ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of the code  whereas the cash is received  if at all  when the equity instrument is sold 
we seek to avoid oid with all potential investments under review 
in addition  as a business development company under the act  we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
prior to the externalization of our management on october   the start of the fiscal year  we provided these services through our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone capital advisers  inc since the externalization of our management on october   our investment adviser  gladstone management corporation gladstone management  began to provide these services on our behalf through its officers who are also our officers 
in addition  gladstone management provides other services to our portfolio companies  for which it receives fees  in connection with our investments 
the fees for these services are generally paid to gladstone management in part at the time a prospective portfolio company signs a non binding term sheet with us as further described in the following paragraph  with the remainder paid at the closing of the investment 
these fees are generally non recurring  however in some instances they may have a recurring component which is also paid to gladstone management 
any such fees received  with the exception of the recurring fees  by gladstone management are credited against the management advisory fee payable to gladstone management pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement  which has the effect of reducing our expenses to the extent of any such fees received by gladstone management 
the specific services gladstone management provides vary by portfolio company  but generally include a wide variety of services to the portfolio companies such as investment banking services  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing structuring financing from multiple lenders and investors  reviewing existing credit facilities  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital  turnaround management  merger and acquisition services and recruiting new management personnel 
prior to the start of fiscal year  gladstone capital advisers  inc provided these services and received these fees and we have recorded fees for these services as fee income for the periods in which these fees were earned by us 
prior to making an investment  we ordinarily enter into a non binding term sheet with the potential borrower 
these non binding term sheets are generally subject to a number of conditions  including but not limited to the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigations of the potential borrower s business and reaching agreement on the legal documentation for the loan 
upon execution of the non binding term sheet  the potential borrower generally pays gladstone management a non refundable fee for its services rendered through the date of the non binding term sheet 
prior to the externalization of our management on october   we recognized this as fee revenue upon execution of the non binding term sheet 
effective october   these fees are received by gladstone management and are offset against amounts due to gladstone management  which has the effect of reducing our expenses to the extent of any such fees received by gladstone management 
in the event that we expend significant effort in considering and negotiating a potential investment that ultimately is not consummated  we generally will seek reimbursement from the proposed borrower for our reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proposed transaction 
any amounts collected for expenses incurred by gladstone management in connection with unconsummated investments will be reimbursed to gladstone management 
amounts collected for these expenses incurred by us will be reimbursed to us and will be recognized as other income in the period in which such reimbursement is received 
also  in the event that we have incurred significant legal fees in connection with the transaction  we will typically seek reimbursement for these expenses from the proposed borrower 
however  there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in collecting any such reimbursements 
the only significant continuing revenue associated with the investments we have already closed is interest income and  potentially  capital gains realized in connection with the liquidation of any associated equity interest eg  warrants 
during the fiscal year ended september   we extended  directly or through participations  approximately million of new loans to a total of companies 
also  during the fiscal year ended september   nine borrowers repaid their loans ahead of contractual maturity and we sold two loan investments for an aggregate return of capital of approximately million and we received scheduled contractual principal repayments of approximately million  for total principal repayments of approximately million 
since our initial public offering in august  we have made different loans to  or investments in  companies for a total of approximately million  before giving effect to principal repayments on investments and divestitures 
we are continuously working toward the consummation of more loan origination and syndicated investments in an effort to grow our loan portfolio 
these prospective loans are subject to  among other things  the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of each borrower  acceptance of terms and structure and attainment of necessary consents 
with respect to each prospective loan  we will only agree to provide the loan if  among other things  the results of our due diligence investigations are satisfactory  the terms and conditions of the loan are acceptable and all necessary consents are received 
our management has initiated its due diligence investigations of the potential borrowers  however we cannot assure you that we will not discover facts in the course of completing our due diligence that would render a particular investment imprudent or that any of these loans will actually be made 
external adviser effective october   pursuant to our advisory agreement with gladstone management  we pay gladstone management an annual advisory fee of of our total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly computed increments of  and an annual administrative fee of of our total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly computed increments of 
this fee is then directly reduced by the amount of loan servicing fees paid to gladstone management and any other fees received by gladstone management from our borrowers and potential borrowers 
we continue to pay direct expenses including  but not limited to  directors fees  legal and accounting fees  stockholder related expenses  and directors and officers insurance 
effective july   gladstone management assumed the responsibility for servicing our loan portfolio pursuant to a loan servicing agreement with gladstone business loan llc business loan 
gladstone management services these loans in return for a annual fee  based on the monthly aggregate outstanding loan balance of the loans pledged under the facility 
prior to july   our loans were serviced under a similar agreement between business loan and gladstone capital advisers  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  although the fees from these intercompany transactions were eliminated through the consolidation of our financial results with those of business loan and gladstone capital advisers  inc prior to the externalization of our management  we were party to an expense sharing arrangement with gladstone management  which during such time served as the external adviser to gladstone commercial corporation gladstone commercial  a real estate investment trust affiliated with us 
under this expense sharing arrangement  gladstone management reimbursed gladstone capital advisers  inc for a portion of our total payroll and benefits expenses based on the percentage of total hours worked by each of our employees on gladstone commercial matters 
gladstone management also reimbursed gladstone capital advisers  inc for its pro rata portion of all other general expenses based on the percentage of total hours worked by all of our employees on gladstone commercial matters 
gladstone management further passed its share of these expenses along to gladstone commercial under a separate advisory agreement 
at september   gladstone management owed us  of reimbursements recorded in fees due from affiliate  all of which was subsequently paid 
following our engagement of gladstone management on october   the first day of our fiscal year  gladstone management now directly employs all of our personnel and pays its payroll  benefits  and general expenses directly 
thus  the expense sharing arrangement between gladstone capital advisers  inc and gladstone management terminated upon the externalization of our management on october  on december   our stockholders approved a proposal to enter into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement the amended agreement with gladstone management and an administration agreement the administration agreement between the company and gladstone administration  llc the administrator  a wholly owned subsidiary of the adviser 
the amended agreement provides for an annual base management fee equal to of our assets and an income based incentive fee which will reward the adviser if our quarterly net investment income before giving effect to the incentive fee exceeds of our net assets 
the agreement also provides for a capital gains based incentive fee  whereby the adviser will receive a fee equal to of our realized capital gains net of realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation 
under the administration agreement  the company will pay separately for its allocable portion of the administrator s overhead expenses in performing its obligations  including rent  and the company s allocable portion of the salaries and benefits expenses of its chief financial officer  chief compliance officer and controller and their respective staffs 
in connection with the approval of the amended agreement  we will terminate our amended and restated equity incentive plan the plan  and seek agreement from all holders of stock options to exercise or terminate their options within a limited period of time 
the amended agreement and the administration agreement will become effective upon the later of i october   or ii the first day of the first fiscal quarter following the date that all existing stock options are exercised 
the amended agreement and administration agreement will not become effective as long as the plan is in effect or as long as there are any outstanding stock options 
the current investment advisory agreement with gladstone management will continue in effect until these new agreements become effective 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k as of september  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
we have identified our investment valuation process  tax status and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting policies 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
general valuation policy we value our investment portfolio each quarter 
we carry our investments at fair value  as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
securities that are publicly traded  if any  are valued at the closing price of the exchange or securities market on which they are listed on the valuation date 
securities which are not traded on a public exchange or securities market  but for which a limited market exists and that have been rated by a nrsro as defined below  such as certain participations in syndicated loans  are valued at the indicative bid price offered by the syndication agent on the valuation date 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded  for which a limited market does not exist  or for which a limited market exists but that have not been rated by a nrsro or for which we have various degrees of trading restrictions are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
in making the good faith determination of the value of these securities  we start with the cost basis of the security  which includes the amortized original issue discount  and pik interest  if any 
we then apply the methods set out below in valuation methods 
members of our portfolio management team prepare the valuations of our investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts 
these individuals also consult with portfolio company senior management and ownership to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance  including information such as industry trends  new product development  and other operational issues 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security 
we currently engage standard poor s loan evaluation service s p to help evaluate the value of the majority of our loan securities other than those which are publicly traded or for which a limited market exists  as described above  as well as for evaluations on success fees conditional interest included in some loan securities 
we and s p only evaluate the value of a success fee if the probability of receiving the success fee on a given loan is above  a threshold of significance  in which case a value is assigned 
upon completing our collection of data with respect to the investments including the information described under credit information  the risk ratings of the loans described under loan grading and risk rating and the factors described under valuation methods  this valuation data is presented to s p 
s p makes its independent assessment of the data that we have assembled and assesses its own data to determine market values for the securities 
with regard to its work  s p has issued the following paragraph s p provides evaluated price opinions which are reflective of what s p believes the bid side of the market would be for each loan after careful review and analysis of descriptive  market and credit information 
each price reflects s p s best judgment based upon careful examination of a variety of market factors 
because of fluctuation in the market and in other factors beyond its control  s p cannot guarantee these evaluations 
the evaluations reflect the market prices  or estimates thereof  on the date specified 
the prices are based on comparable market prices for similar securities 
market information has been obtained from reputable secondary market sources 
although these sources are considered reliable  s p cannot guarantee their accuracy 
with our assessment and s p value estimates as a backdrop  our board of directors votes to accept or not accept the analyses and values recommended by management and s p 
at september  and september   the board of directors elected to accept the valuations recommended by s p on the loans in our portfolio as denoted on the schedule of investments as of september  and september  in our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to september   the fair value of our investment in ari holdings  inc was reduced from the value proposed by s p because the investment was sold in november at a value less than that indicated by s p on september  our board of directors determined to reduce the value proposed by s p to the value of the sale price and as such the sale price of the investment is reflected in the fair value on our schedule of investments as of september  in our consolidated financial statements 
because there is a delay between when we close a loan and when the loan can be evaluated by s p  new loans are not valued immediately by s p  rather  the board of directors makes its own determination about the value of these loans in accordance with our valuation policy 
because s p does not provide values for mortgage loans or equity securities  our board of directors also determines the fair value of these investments using our valuation policy without the input of s p 
credit information we monitor a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance 
we require our portfolio companies to provide annual audited and either monthly or quarterly unaudited financial statements 
using these statements  we calculate and evaluate the credit statistics 
for purposes of analyzing the financial performance of our portfolio companies  we may make certain adjustments to their cash flow statements to reflect the pro forma results of a company consistent with a change of control transaction  to reflect anticipated cost savings resulting from a merger or restructuring  costs related to new product development  compensation to previous owners  and other acquisition or restructuring related items 
for those investments for which s p prepares valuation recommendations  we provide this credit information to s p for its use in preparing its recommendations 
for those investments for which s p does not prepare valuation recommendations  management uses this credit information in connection with its preparation of valuation recommendations 
loan grading and risk rating as part of our valuation procedures we risk rate all of our loans 
our risk rating system uses a scale of to this system is used to estimate the probability of default on our debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default 
these types of systems are referred to as risk rating systems and are used by banks and rating agencies 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold 
for those investments for which s p prepares valuation recommendations  we compile this information and provide it to s p for its consideration in determining its valuation recommendations 
for those investments for which s p does not prepare valuation recommendations  management uses this information to develop valuation recommendations 
we seek to have our risk rating system mirror the risk rating systems of major risk rating organizations such as those provided by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsro as defined in rule a under the act 
while we seek to mirror the nrsro systems  we cannot provide any assurance that our risk rating system provides the same risk rating as a nrsro 
the following chart is an estimate of the relationship of our risk rating system to the designations used by two nrsros as they risk rate debt securities of major companies 
because we have established our system to rate debt securities of companies that are unrated by any nrsro  there can be no assurance that the correlation to the nrsro set out below is accurate 
it is our understanding that most debt securities of middle market companies do not exceed the grade of bbb on a nrsro scale  so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of aaa  aa or a 
therefore  our scale begins with the designation bbb as the best risk rating 
company s system first nrsro second nrsro gladstone capital s description a baa bbb probability of default pd during the next ten years is and the expected loss el is or less baa bbb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa cc pd is and the el is to n a d pd is or there is a payment default and the el is greater than a the default rates set here are for a ten year term debt  if the company s debt security is less than ten years then the probability of default is adjusted to a lower percentage for the shorter period which may move the security higher on the company s risk rating scale 
the above scale gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default 
at september   the average debt security was risk rated for all debt securities and the weighted average risk rating was for all debt securities 
the following table lists the risk ratings for all of the debt securities by quarter during the fiscal year ended september  rating december  march  june  september  average weighted average highest lowest the above scale gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default 
our policy is to stop accruing interest on an investment if we determine that interest is no longer collectible 
at september   no payments were past due on any of our debt securities 
at september   ari holdings  inc was past due on its payments and was placed on non accrual 
we do not risk rate our equity securities 
valuation methods for debt securities  we first determine if the debt security is publicly traded ie  if it is listed on an exchange or securities market 
if it is publicly traded  then we determine the value based on the closing price for the security on the exchange or securities market on which it is listed on the valuation date 
if the security is not publicly traded  but a limited market for the security exists  such as for a participation in a syndicated loan  then we value it at the indicative bid price offered by the syndication agent on the valuation date 
at september   none of the debt securities in our portfolio were publicly traded and there was a limited market for debt securities in our portfolio 
at september   we determined that none of the debt securities in our portfolio were publicly traded and that there was a limited market for five debt securities in our portfolio 
for debt securities that are not publicly traded  for which there is no market  or for which there is a market but have not been rated by a nrsro  we begin with the risk rating designation of the security described above 
using the risk rating designation above  we seek to determine the value of the security as if we intended to sell the security in a current sale 
to determine the current sale price of the security  we consider some or all of the following factors financial standing of the issuer of the security  comparison of the business and financial plan of the issuer with actual results  the cost of the security  the size of the security held as it relates to the liquidity of the market for such securities  contractual restrictions on the disposition of the security  pending public offering of the issuer of the security  pending reorganization activity affecting the issuer such as mergers or debt restructuring  reported prices of similar securities of the issuer or comparable issuers  ability of the issuer to obtain needed financing  changes in the economy affecting the issuer  recent purchases or sale of a security of the issuer  pricing by other buyers or sellers of similar securities  financial statements of the borrower  reports from portfolio company senior management and ownership  the type of security  cost at date of purchase  size of holding  discount from market value of unrestricted securities of the same class at the time of purchase  special reports prepared by analysts  information as to any transactions or offers with respect to the security  existence of merger proposals or tender offers affecting the securities  the collateral  the issuer s ability to make payments  the current and forecasted earnings of the issuer  sales to third parties of similar securities  statistical ratios compared to lending standards  statistical ratios compared to other similar securities  and other pertinent factors 
for those debt securities for which s p prepares valuation recommendations  we provide the foregoing information to s p for its use in preparing its recommendations 
for convertible debt  equity  success fees or other equity like securities  we first determine if there is any market for the security 
if there is a market  then we determine the value based on the market prices for the security  even if that market is not robust 
at september  and september   there was no market for any of the equity securities we owned 
if there is no market for the equity securities  then we use the same information we would use for a debt security valuation described above  except risk rating  as well as standard valuation techniques used by major valuation firms to value the equity securities of private companies 
these valuation techniques consist of discounted cash flow of the expected sale price in the future  valuation of the securities based on recent sales in comparable transactions  and a review of similar companies that are publicly traded and the market multiple of their equity securities 
at september  and september   we had  invested  at cost  in equity securities compared to our debt portfolio with a cost basis of  and  respectively 
at september   we had total unrealized depreciation of  which was mainly composed of unrealized depreciation in our senior subordinated term debt investment in finn corporation excluding the warrants of  our senior subordinated term debt investment in xspedius communications of  and our senior term debt in ari holdings  inc of  which was subsequently sold at the september  reflected fair value  partially offset by unrealized appreciation  most notably on  the value of our warrants of finn corporation  which had an unrealized appreciation of  and our senior term debt investment in woven electronics corporation  which had unrealized appreciation of  this aforementioned unrealized appreciation plus unrealized appreciation of  on certain other investments  primarily in our originated loan investments and certain syndicate participations  most notably infor global solutions  which had unrealized appreciation of  which resulted in overall net unrealized depreciation of at september   america s water heater rentals senior loan had an appreciation of  in its value as a result of the value applied to the success fee 
also  the value of our warrants of finn corporation had an appreciation of  at september  this aforementioned appreciation plus appreciation of  on certain other investments  for overall appreciation of  partially offsets total depreciation of  which was mainly composed of depreciation in our senior subordinated term debt investment in finn corporation excluding the warrants of  our senior subordinated term debt investment in marcal paper mills  inc of  our senior term debt investment in coyne international enterprises of  and our senior term debt investment in inca metal products corporation of  tax status federal income taxes we intend to continue to qualify for treatment as a ric under subtitle a  chapter of subchapter m of the code 
as a ric  we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders 
to qualify as a ric  we are required to distribute to stockholders at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code 
we have a policy to pay out as a dividend up to of that amount 
revenue recognition interest income recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
we will stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
conditional interest or a success fee is recorded when earned upon full repayment of a loan investment 
payment in kind interest we also have some loans in our portfolio which contain a payment in kind pik provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain our status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
fee income the act requires that a business development company make available managerial assistance to its portfolio companies by providing significant guidance and counsel concerning the management  operations  or business objective and policies of the respective portfolio company 
prior to october   we provided managerial assistance to our portfolio companies in connection with our investments through our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone capital advisers  inc effective october   we began providing these and other services through our external adviser  gladstone management 
currently  neither we nor gladstone management receive fees in connection with managerial assistance 
however  effective october  our adviser  gladstone management  receives the fees for the other services it provides  and those fees for other services are credited to the investment advisory fees due to gladstone management 
these other fees are generally paid to gladstone management in part at the time a prospective portfolio company signs a non binding term sheet with us  with the remainder paid at the closing of the investment 
these fees are generally non recurring  are recognized as revenue when earned and are paid directly to gladstone management by the borrower or potential borrower  effective october  and for all future periods 
the services gladstone management provides vary by investment  but generally include a wide variety of services to the portfolio companies such as investment banking services  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing structuring financing from multiple lenders and investors  reviewing existing credit facilities  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital  turnaround management  merger and acquisition services and recruiting new management personnel 
any services of this nature subsequent to the closing would generally generate a separate fee at the time of completion 
from time to time  we are invited to participate as a co lender in a transaction 
in the event that we do not provide significant services in connection with our investment  loan fees paid directly to gladstone management in such situations are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan 
results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and september  operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended september  was million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase is primarily a result of a rise in interest income from an increase of approximately million of new investments from the prior year and the collection of approximately million of exit fees upon the full repayment of a portfolio company investment 
interest income from our investments in debt securities of private companies was approximately million  including  of pik interest  for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   including  of pik interest 
this increase was primarily the result of approximately million of new investments for the fiscal year ended september  and the collection of million of exit fees upon the full repayment of a portfolio company investment 
the decrease in pik income for the fiscal year ended september  was the result of scheduled principal repayments for one loan containing a pik provision and an early repayment for another loan containing a pik provision 
the weighted average yield on our portfolio for the fiscal year ended september  was without giving effect to pik interest and after giving effect to pik interest 
the weighted average yield on our portfolio for the fiscal year ended september  was without giving effect to pik interest and after giving effect to pik interest 
the yields were computed based on the cost value of the investment portfolios 
interest income from invested cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  as compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  this decrease was primarily caused by a decrease in cash balances as a result of million of new investments and generally maintaining less cash on hand and using borrowed funds to fund new investments 
no fee income was recorded for the fiscal year ended september   as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  this decrease was the result of the externalization of our management  effective october   through the engagement of our affiliate  gladstone management  to serve as our external adviser 
gladstone management receives all fees in connection with our investments and prospective investments  which fees are offset against the advisory fee payable to gladstone management 
fee income for the fiscal year ended september  consisted primarily of investment banking and annual review fees received in connection with investments we closed during the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended september   the fee income was mainly attributable to the closing of the gammill  inc  woven electronics corp  benetech  inc mistras holdings corp 
million investment  a and g  inc and allied extruders  inc 
investments  in the approximate aggregate amount of million

operating expenses operating expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase was mainly a result of an increase in interest expense  stockholder related costs and professional fees 
additionally  operating expenses for the fiscal year ended september  reflected a significant reduction in direct operating expenses  as a result of the externalization of our management effective october   offset by an increase in loan servicing fees and management fee incurred as a result of this externalization 
loan servicing fees of approximately million were incurred for the fiscal year ended september  these fees were incurred in connection with a loan servicing agreement between gladstone business loan llc business loan and gladstone management  which became effective july  these fees were directly credited against the amount of the management fee due to gladstone management 
during the fiscal year ended september   loan servicing fees of approximately  were incurred from the period july   the date that gladstone management began to service our loan portfolio  since prior to that the loan portfolio was serviced under a similar agreement with gladstone capital advisers inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and the fees business loan paid to gladstone capital advisers  inc were eliminated upon consolidation of our financial results 
effective october   we entered into an advisory agreement with gladstone management whereby gladstone management serves as our external adviser 
as compensation for the services of gladstone management  we pay gladstone management an annual advisory fee of of total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly computed increments of  and an annual administrative fee of of total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly computed increments of  for a total fee of of total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors

any such fees are credited directly against the management fee payable to gladstone management 
the management fee is also directly reduced by the amount of the monthly loan servicing fees we pay to gladstone management

we anticipate borrowing funds and issuing additional equity securities to obtain additional capital 
to this end  we have filed with the sec a registration statement that would permit us to issue  through one or more transactions  up to an aggregate of million in securities  consisting of common stock  preferred stock and or debt securities 
on september   we closed on our public offering pursuant to this registration statement of  shares at price of  less underwriters discount of five percent for net proceeds of approximately million  excluding offering costs

revolving credit facility through our wholly owned subsidiary gladstone business loan llc business loan  the company has obtained a million revolving credit facility 
on may   the company executed a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which it agreed to sell certain loans to business loan in consideration of a membership interest therein 
simultaneously  business loan executed a credit agreement with cibc world markets inc cibc  as administrative agent  and others  pursuant to which business loan pledged the loans purchased from the company to secure future advances by certain institutional lenders 
on september   cibc assigned its interest in the credit facility to deutsche bank ag  which matured on may  and was renewed for one year  due to mature on may  for a fee of  as renewed  the db facility 
interest rates charged on the advances under the facility are based on london interbank offered rate libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate  depending on market conditions  and adjusts periodically 
as of september   the outstanding principal balance under this credit facility was approximately million at an interest rate of  as compared to the outstanding principal balance under this credit facility of approximately million at an interest rate of at september  available borrowings are subject to various constraints imposed by deutsche bank ag  based on the aggregate loan balance pledged by business loan  which varies as loans or added and repaid  regardless of whether such repayments are early prepayment or are made as contractually required 
at september   the remaining borrowing capacity available under the db facility was approximately million 
we are in the process of negotiating a renewal of this db facility  however there can be no guarantee that we will be able to renew the db facility on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
in the event that we are not able to renew or refinance the db facility this could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and ability to fund new investments 
in october  our board of directors approved a resolution to seek to increase this credit facility to million 
the facility contains covenants that require business loan to maintain its status as a separate entity  prohibit certain significant corporate transactions such as mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  and restrict material changes to the company s credit and collection policies 
the facility also restricts some of the terms and provisions including interest rates  terms to maturity and payments schedules and limits the borrower and industry concentrations of loans that are eligible to secure advances 
as of september   business loan was in compliance with all of the facility covenants 
we currently intend to securitize all of the loans held by business loan and if we are able to do so  we will use the proceeds from the securitization to pay down any amounts then outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the administrative agent also requires that any interest or principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with the bank of new york as custodian 
deutsche bank ag is also the trustee of the account and once a month remits the collected funds to the company 
for the fiscal year ended september   the amount due from custodian increased by approximately million as compared to september  gladstone management  our affiliated external adviser  services the loans pledged under the db facility 
as a condition to this servicing arrangement  we executed a performance guaranty pursuant to which we guaranteed that gladstone management would comply fully with all of its obligations under the facility 
the performance guaranty requires us to maintain a minimum net worth of million and to maintain asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness of at least  in accordance with section of the act 
as of september   we were in compliance with our covenants under the performance guaranty 
in june  we entered into a million line of credit agreement with branch banking and trust company bb t agreement which matured on june  and which was modified to extend the maturity date to december  interest on outstanding borrowings is based upon the one month libor plus per annum 
the unused portion of the line of credit is subject to a fee of per annum 
the bb t agreement requires the company to meet and maintain certain covenants and ratios with respect to leverage and liquidity 
as of september   there were no borrowings outstanding under the bb t line of credit 
as of september   there was million outstanding under the bb t line of credit at an interest rate of 
at september   we were in compliance with all covenants under the bb t agreement 
the following table shows our significant contractual obligations for the repayment of debt and payment of other contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total the long term debt obligations represent borrowings under our db facility line of credit that were outstanding at september  this line of credit is scheduled to mature on may  in the event that we are not able to extend or renew the db facility  we would have to repay the borrowings outstanding under this line of credit which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial statements 
the purchase obligations reflected in the above table represent commitments outstanding as of september  to fund two loan investments which were subsequently closed in october and november pursuant to the investment advisory and administrative agreement with gladstone management  we are obligated to make certain payments to gladstone management on a quarterly basis 
payments under the investment advisory and administrative agreement consist of an annual advisory fee of of our total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly increments of  and an annual administrative fee of of our total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly increments of 
as the payments under the investment advisory and administrative agreement will vary based on changes in our total assets during any given payment period  we cannot accurately predict the amount of payments under the advisory agreement 
we are also responsible under gladstone business loan to pay gladstone management a loan servicing fee at an annual rate of of the monthly aggregate outstanding loan balance of the loans pledged under the db facility 
for the fiscal year ended september   the amount of fees incurred by us which were payable to gladstone management were  of which  was outstanding as of september  since the investment advisory and administrative agreement is based on total assets outstanding at each quarter end and the loan servicing fee is based on the monthly aggregate outstanding loan balance  it is not feasible at this time to determine the amount of future payments under these agreements 
as we expect to continue to make more investments in future fiscal years  we expect that the amount of our total assets may increase  and thus  the contractual obligations attributable to advisory fee payments under the advisory agreement are likely to increase and likewise  as the loan portfolio increases or decreases as a result of new loans  or principal repayments  the amount of the loan servicing fee will adjust accordingly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
we expect that ultimately approximately of the loans in our portfolio will be made at fixed rates  with approximately made at variable rates 
currently our portfolio has approximately of the total of the loan portfolio cost basis at fixed rates  approximately of the total loan portfolio cost basis at variable rates with a floor  approximately of the total loan portfolio cost basis at a variable rate with a floor and ceiling  and the remaining of the total loan portfolio cost basis at variable rates 
in addition  we have two variable rate borrowing facilities 
we have a million revolving credit facility with deutsche bank ag which matures in may we also have a million line of credit agreement with branch banking and trust company which matures in december in february  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in order to fulfill an obligation under our deutsche bank ag line of credit to enter into certain hedging transactions in connection with our borrowings under the line of credit 
we purchased this interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million for a one time  up front payment of  the interest rate cap agreement entitles us to receive payments  if any  equal to the amount by which interest payments on million at the point which one month libor exceed the payments on million at 
the cap expires in february this interest rate cap agreement effectively caps our interest payments on our line of credit borrowing  up to the notional amount of the interest rate cap  at five percent 
this mitigates our exposure to increases in interest rates on our borrowings on our lines of credit  which are at variable rates 
at september   the cap agreement had a fair market value of  and a current notional amount of million 
at september   the one month libor rate was approximately 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net increase in net assets resulting from operations  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond the interest rate cap agreement are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  a hypothetical increase in the one month libor by would increase our net increase in net assets resulting from operations by approximately million or  over the next twelve months  compared to the net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the twelve months ended september  a hypothetical decrease in the one month libor by would decrease net increase in net assets resulting from operations by approximately million  or  over the next twelve months  compared to the net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the twelve months ended september  although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
in the event that we securitize a portion of our loan portfolio  we believe that we will likely be required to enter into further hedging arrangements in the future with respect to securitized loans 
while hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future  such as interest rate swap agreements  may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments
