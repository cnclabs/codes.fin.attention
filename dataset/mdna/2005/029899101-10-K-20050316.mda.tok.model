item legal proceedings water quality related litigation scw was a defendant in twenty two lawsuits involving claims pertaining to water quality 
nineteen of the lawsuits were coordinated in the los angeles superior court and involved water served by the company in the san gabriel valley and pomona valley areas of los angeles county 
on august   scw was ordered dismissed from all the nineteen cases in los angeles county 
the order was issued by the trial judge presiding over these matters  and follows a lengthy legal proceeding dating back to april  the court found scw did not violate established water quality standards and dismissed the cases after allowing reasonable time and opportunity to the plaintiffs to prove otherwise 
on september   several plaintiffs filed an appeal to the trial court s order to dismiss scw 
scw is unable to predict the outcome of this appeal 
these lawsuits filed in los angeles county superior court were based on allegations that scw and the other defendants had provided and continued to provide plaintiffs with contaminated water from its wells  several of which are located in an area of the san gabriel valley that had been designated a federal superfund site  that the maintenance of this contaminated well water had resulted in contamination of the soil  subsurface soil and surrounding air with solvents and other substances  and that plaintiffs had been injured and their property damaged as a result 
three of the lawsuits involved a customer service area located in sacramento county that had been filed in sacramento county superior court 
in july  one of the plaintiffs filed for dismissal and the court subsequently dismissed the case 
in october  the remaining two claims were also ordered dismissed by the court 
the claims have been permanently dismissed since the plaintiffs failed to file a notice of appeal within the allotted time of days 
these lawsuits filed in sacramento county superior court were based on the allegations that scw and other defendants had delivered water to plaintiffs that were contaminated with a number of chemicals  including 
table of contents trichloroethylene  perchloroethylene  carbon tetrachloride  perchlorate  freon  hexavalent chromium and other unnamed chemicals and that plaintiffs had been injured and their property damaged as a result 
scw is subject to self insured retention provisions in its applicable insurance policies and has either expensed the self insured amounts or has reserved against payment of these amounts as appropriate 
scw s various insurance carriers have  to date  provided reimbursement for costs incurred above the self insured amounts for defense against these lawsuits  subject to a reservation of rights 
other water quality litigation perchlorate and or volatile organic compounds voc have been detected in five wells servicing scw s san gabriel system 
scw filed suit  along with two other affected water purveyors and the san gabriel basin water quality authority wqa  in federal court against some of those responsible for the contamination 
some of the other potential defendants settled with scw  other water purveyors and the wqa the water entities on voc related issues prior to the filing of the lawsuit 
in response to the filing of the federal lawsuit  the potentially responsible party prp defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit or strike certain portions of the suit 
the judge issued a ruling on april  granting in part and denying in part the defendant s motions 
a key ruling of the court was that the water purveyors  including the registrant  by virtue of their ownership of wells contaminated with hazardous chemicals are themselves prps under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
registrant has  pursuant to permission of the court  amended its suit to claim certain affirmative defenses as an innocent party under cercla 
in this same suit  the prps have filed cross complaints against the registrant  the other two affected water purveyors  the wqa and the metropolitan water district  the main san gabriel basin watermaster and others on the theory that they arranged for and did transport contaminated water into the san gabriel valley groundwater basin for use by registrant and the other two affected water providers and for other related claims 
registrant is presently unable to predict the outcome of this ruling on its ability to fully recover from the prps the future costs associated with the treatment of these wells 
on august   the us environmental protection agency epa issued unilateral administrative orders uao against parties deemed responsible for polluting the groundwater in that portion of the san gabriel valley from which two of scw s impacted wells draw water 
scw was not named as a party to the uao 
the uao requires that these parties remediate the contamination 
the judge in the federal lawsuit has appointed a special master to oversee mandatory settlement discussions between the prps and the water entities 
epa is also conducting settlement discussions with several prps  including those which previously settled with the water entities on voc matters  regarding the uao 
the water entities and epa are working to coordinate their settlement discussions in order to arrive at a complete resolution of all issues affecting the federal lawsuits and the uao 
registrant is presently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of any of these settlement discussions 
santa maria groundwater basin adjudication in  the santa maria valley water conservation district plaintiff filed a lawsuit against multiple defendants  including scw  the city of santa maria  and several other public water purveyors 
the plaintiff s lawsuit seeks an adjudication of the santa maria groundwater basin 
after some procedural rulings by the superior court  the lawsuit is now a full basin adjudication involving all entities owning acres or more within the basin boundaries approximately  defendants 
the plaintiff s stated objective in the adjudication lawsuit is to have the superior court impose and oversee the implementation of a basin management plan that ensures the long term integrity and reliability of the basin water resources 
to protect its groundwater supply so that sufficient water production rights continue to be available to meet scw s customers needs in the santa maria customer service area  scw has been vigorously defending its water rights in the adjudication lawsuit 
as of december   scw has incurred costs in defending its rights in the basin  including legal and expert witness fees  which have been deferred in utility plant for rate recovery 
management believes that  when the adjudication lawsuit is finally resolved  scw will have secured its right to pump groundwater from the basin and to continue to rely on the basin as a source of supply for its customers needs 
management also believes that the recovery of these costs through rates is probable  however  management cannot give assurance that the cpuc will ultimately allow recovery of all or any of the costs that have accumulated with this lawsuit 

table of contents other litigation registrant is also subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business 
other than as disclosed above  no other legal proceedings are pending  which are believed to be material 
management believes that rate recovery  proper insurance coverage and reserves are in place to insure against property  general liability and workers compensation claims incurred in the ordinary course of business

in addition  there was a favorable decision issued by the cpuc on july  that resulted in a million net pretax increase in operating income 
scw received million in may of from the city of santa monica city pursuant to a settlement agreement in which scw sold its water rights in the charnock groundwater basin basin to the city and assigned to the city its rights against all potentially responsible parties who stored  transported and dispensed gasoline containing methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in underground storage tanks  pipelines or other related infrastructure in the basin 
the total proceeds of million from the sale and the assignment of rights were offset by an impairment loss of  associated with assets removed from rate base  pursuant to the decision 
scw recorded the impairment loss on assets removed from rate base in other operating expenses 

table of contents operating revenues for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  higher water revenues reflect an increase of in water consumption resulting from changes in weather conditions that contributed to an increase in revenues of approximately million 
differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas impact sales of water to customers  causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparable periods 
additionally  the cpuc in its march  decision authorized an annualized increase of approximately million in revenues for scw s region iii service area that was effective on march  and increased revenues by approximately million in in addition  in august  the cpuc approved rate increases for regions i and ii that became effective retroactive to january and february  respectively 
this also contributed to the increase in water revenues between the two periods of approximately million in for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects primarily an increase of in kilowatt hour consumption 
registrant relies upon rate approval by state regulatory agencies in california and arizona  in order to recover operating expenses and provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant 
without such adequate rate relief granted in a timely manner  revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted 
for the year ended december   other operating revenues increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to approximately  of additional revenues associated with the operation of the water and wastewater systems at fort bliss  located near el paso  texas that commenced on october  pursuant to the terms of a year contract with the us government 
in addition  there was a  increase in asus s contracted services 
operating expenses for the year ended december   of the company s supply mix was purchased water as compared to purchased water for the year ended december  purchased water costs increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to additional purchases of water to replace groundwater supply lost due to wells being removed from service 
the wells were removed from service as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems  particularly in scw s metropolitan and foothill districts 
together  the cost of purchased water in these districts increased by approximately million 
in addition  increases in the other districts totaled million due to increases in water consumption and supplier rates 
finally  approximately  was incurred beginning in june in connection with the trucking of water in scw s wrightwood customer service area due to a continued decline in water levels and production capacity in the existing wells 
with the completion and placing into service of a new well  scw stopped hauling water in august scw has hired an engineering consultant to assist in finding a long term answer to the water supply for the wrightwood community 
in the interim  the recent wet weather in southern california has been beneficial to groundwater levels in the wrightwood area 
changes in the water resource mix between water supplied from purchased sources and that supplied from registrant s own wells can increase decrease actual supply related costs relative to that approved for recovery through rates  thereby impacting earnings either negatively or positively 
registrant has the opportunity to change the supply related costs recovered through rates by application to the appropriate regulatory body 
registrant believes that its applications for recovery of supply related costs accurately reflect the water supply situation as it is known at the time 
however  it is impossible to adequately protect earnings from adverse changes in supply costs related to unforeseen contamination or other loss of water supply 
for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for pumping decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to additional wells being taken out of service due to water quality issues and for unscheduled maintenance which resulted in increased purchased water and less pumping  the effects of which were partially offset by higher consumption 

table of contents for the year ended december   cost of power purchased for resale to customers in scw s bear valley electric division increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the reversal in of a  gain generated from a one time sale of energy on the spot market in april the gain  which was previously recorded in april to the supply cost balancing account  was ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc in march to be refunded  plus interest  to mirant americas energy marketing  inc mirant marketing 
this refund increased the cost of power purchased for resale during the year ended december   with a corresponding decrease in the supply cost balancing account included in the statement of income 
there was no net impact on earnings 
the sale of excess energy on the spot market in resulted from a one month overlap of energy purchase agreements 
in addition  there was a  increase in natural gas cost for the new mw generator that went on line in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by  of decreased purchased power for resale resulting from certain refunds and credits 
unrealized gain and loss on purchased power contracts represents gains and losses recorded for scw s purchased power agreements with pinnacle west capital corporation pwcc  which qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the  pretax unrealized loss on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  is due to a decrease in the current forward market prices since december  unrealized gains and losses at bear valley electric will continue to impact earnings during the life of the contract with pwcc  which terminates in for the year ended december   registrant recorded a million gain on the sale of water rights reflecting a favorable cpuc decision on july  as discussed previously  the million represents settlement proceeds received in may from the city of santa monica relating to the sale and the assignment of rights regarding the charnock groundwater basin 
for the year ended december   groundwater production assessments decreased by as compared to the year ended december  due to i a reduction in pumped water production by approximately and  ii scw s receipt of  for leasing excess water rights during the year ended december  as compared to  received during the year ended december  these excess water rights are recorded as a reduction to groundwater production assessments 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in assessment rates levied against groundwater production  effective july and the decrease in pumped water costs was due primarily to wells in the metropolitan and foothill districts being down for maintenance and water quality reasons 
this resulted in increased purchased water and less pumping 
a decrease of million during the year ended december  in the provision for supply cost balancing accounts as compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects the recording of a probable refund of million to customers representing the net proceeds received from the potentially responsible parties prps with respect to the charnock basin contamination  pursuant to a proposed decision issued by the cpuc in december  which was finalized in july in addition  there was the  refund to mirant marketing  previously discussed in cost of power purchased for resale 
these decreases were offset by the recording of million net over collection in the water memorandum supply cost accounts as a regulatory liability during  with a corresponding charge booked to the provision for supply cost balancing account 
this followed scw s filing of advice letters for regions i and ii related to the memorandum supply cost accounts on april  as a result  in may  scw began recording the net over collection as a regulatory liability 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i an impairment loss totaling  recorded in june of related to the charnock groundwater basin assets being removed from rate base pursuant to the cpuc order on july   ii higher labor costs which increased by approximately  iii higher operating expenses of  at asus due to the commencement of operations of the water and wastewater system at fort bliss  iv the receipt of  in in connection with a settlement agreement with a prp for the contamination of one of scw s wells for previously incurred outside services in connection with this issue there was no similar reimbursements in  and v increases in various other operating expenses 

table of contents for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i approximately  increase in outside legal and consulting services incurred in connection with new business development  most specifically in the area of privatization of water and wastewater systems at military bases  ii approximately  increase in outside services related to sarbanes oxley compliance requirements  iii approximately million increase in pensions and benefits due to actuarial assumption changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and increases in various benefit costs  iv the reversal of  and million in water quality related reserves into income during the first quarter and fourth quarter of  respectively  and v approximately  increase in general rate case expenses 
registrant believes that prudent administrative expenses approved in advance by state regulators to be incurred in the operation and management of its regulated subsidiaries will be recovered through water and electric rates 
amounts included in each general rate case are estimated for future years 
overages from those estimates are not covered in rates 
for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting  among other things  the effects of recording approximately million in additions to utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january in addition  region ii s general rate case was approved in august by the cpuc  which increased the depreciation composite rates retroactive to february  to match the timing of revenue recovery 
this resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately  for the year ended december  registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to registrant s on going construction program at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory agency will be recovered through water and electric rates 
for the year ended december   maintenance expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due principally to an increase in required maintenance on scw s wells and water supply sources  an increase in main leaks and resultant emergency repairs  and acceleration of certain scheduled maintenance projects 
these maintenance increases are included in each general rate case and are covered in rates 
for the year ended december   taxes on operating income increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due  in part  to an increase in pretax operating income of 
in addition  the effective income tax rate etr applicable to the year ended december  reflects an increase of approximately five percentage points to as compared to a etr applicable to the year ended december  associated with this increase was a net positive increase in differences principally related to compensatory and deferred rate case expenses between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through items 
positive flow through differences increase tax expense in one year  with an offsetting decrease in tax expense occurring in another year 
for the year ended december   other taxes increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting additional property taxes resulting from higher assessed values  and increases in payroll taxes based on increased labor costs 
other income loss for the year ended december   other net income increased to  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  this is a result of a cpuc decision on march  that ordered scw to refund percent of the total amount of lease revenues received form the city of folsom since  plus interest  to customers 
pursuant to the order  for the year ended december  scw recorded a million charge against non operating income less million of taxes 
in addition  during there was a million reduction in scw s estimate of customer refunds associated with lease revenues from the city of folsom 
interest charges for the year ended december   interest expense decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to repayment of million of long term debt in october of and recovery of carrying costs of approximately  on the costs incurred in the water quality order instituting investigation matter authorized by the cpuc in march  partially offset by increases in short term borrowings

operating revenues for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased slightly by to million compared to million for the year ended december  higher water revenues reflect two rate increases for scw s region ii that were effective on january  and february   respectively 
these rate increases are expected to generate additional water revenues of approximately million annually 
the rate increases were offset by a decrease of in water consumption resulting from more precipitation and cooler temperatures in most of scw s service areas 
differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas impact sales of water to customers causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparative periods 

table of contents for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects rate increases in july authorized by the cpuc to cover purchased power costs under various power supply agreements which resulted in increased revenues of approximately million  and a slight increase in kilowatt hour consumption
