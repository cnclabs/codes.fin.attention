factors affecting comparability rcc acquisition our operating results for were impacted significantly by the november acquisition of rcc  an affiliated business that  until the date of acquisition  had acted as an external manager for our company and our subsidiaries 
as a result of the acquisition  we generate more taxable income and have assumed numerous expenses that had previously been covered by fees paid to rcc 
further  the issuance of a new class of subsidiary equity as part of the acquisition requires us to apportion certain earnings and identify them as due to the holders of that equity 
likewise  the acquisition affected the comparability of our results to those in through our acquisition of rcc  we now provide management services to real estate equity investment funds we sponsor many of which we now consolidate see accounting changes below and amac  a publicly traded real estate investment trust that is also an affiliated entity 
the funds we sponsor are the upper tier investment funds that provide lihtcs for investors 
our acquisition of rcc has enabled us to accomplish many of our goals 
first  we are now internally managed  which has eliminated any perceived conflicts of interest in the marketplace and broadens our access to capital 
internalizing management has also created a more effective cost structure for a company of our size 
second  the acquisition diversified our revenue streams  increasing our proportion of fee income  which is much less interest rate sensitive and much less capital intensive than our portfolio investing business 
accounting changes the adoption of several accounting pronouncements has affected our financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristic of both liabilities and equity sfas no 
caused us to reclassify certain liability and expense categories while not increasing the actual amounts to be recorded 
the adoption of fin r led to a significant increase in the amount of assets and liabilities we record due to consolidation of numerous investment partnerships see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this consolidation also results in the recognition of the operating results of partnerships in which we have no equity interest  the elimination of transactions between our businesses and those partnerships and the allocation of their results to their investor partners 
results of operations the following is a summary of our operations change change of of of vs vs in thousands revenues revenues revenues revenues    income before income taxes    net income    our consolidated results over the three year period illustrate the impact of our changing business from our structure  previously incorporating only recurring  non taxable revenues with a cost structure based on external management  to one with a large proportion of fee based transactional income and costs associated with internal management 
this transition involved o our acquisition of the mortgage banking business at the end of  adding taxable revenues and internal management costs to our consolidated cost structure  o the inception of the credit enhancement portion of the fund management segment in  adding more taxable business  and o our acquisition of rcc in late  adding the majority of our fund management revenues  and completely internalizing our management structure 
full integration of these businesses in our unified operating platform  while we continued to add to our portfolio investing business  resulted in being our first full year incorporating all businesses

during the same period  aggressive expansion of the portfolio investing and mortgage banking businesses has generated substantial revenue growth 
offsetting these gains in is the elimination of revenues earned by our subsidiaries in transactions with vies we have consolidated beginning april  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the revenues eliminated totaled million in our fund management and million in our portfolio investing businesses 
on a comparable basis  including rcc revenues for all of and  and adjusting for the impact of consolidated vies  our total revenues increased approximately in and in the capri loan interest relates to a loan we provided to capri capital limited partnership capri in july see note to the consolidated financial statements and subsequent event below 
service fee income represents income for services rcc provides to affiliates  which became a part of our operations with the acquisition of rcc in november the increase in other income is primarily due to exit fees received within the mortgage banking business

significant borrowings during and included those related to o acquisitions and fundings of revenue bonds totaling approximately million in and million in  o our acquisition of rcc in  for which we borrowed approximately million to fund the cash portion of the total cost  o short term investments to acquire equity interests inherent in the fund sponsorship portion of our fund management business since the rcc acquisition in the fourth quarter of  and o a loan to capri in the third quarter of as the first step in our full acquisition of its mortgage banking business and partial ownership of its fund advisory business 
in addition to higher borrowings  interest expense reflects an increase in the average borrowing rate to as compared to in and in the increase in the average borrowing rate resulted from gradual increases in the overall interest environment during the year  following sharp declines in prior years 
interest expense in all years presented include amounts paid pursuant to a swap agreement with a notional amount of million as part of our risk management strategy 
additionally  we have entered into six swap transactions with an aggregate notional amount of million  all of which provide protection beginning in these swaps have a weighted average term of four years 
the amount reported as interest expense distributions to preferred shareholders of subsidiary represents dividends on our preferred shares subject to mandatory repurchase  which we reported as an allocation of income outside of operating earnings until the adoption of new accounting rules in july see further discussion in other items below 
salaries and benefits in and include amortization of share grants issued as part of the rcc acquisition transaction 
the amortization of these grants  amounting to million in and million in  will decrease in to million due to a majority of the remaining shares vesting within the year 
the underlying increase in salary costs is directly attributable to the internalization of management in the fourth quarter of and subsequent hiring as our businesses have expanded 
prior to the rcc acquisition  all salary costs recognized were generated by the mortgage banking business 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly due to our acquisition of rcc and the associated recognition of expenses associated with management of the company and origination of tax credit equity funds 
these expenses include approximately million in organization and offering o o costs in and approximately million in we did not record the expenses of consolidated vies prior to april  the interest and other expenses do not represent any cash or non cash charges to be currently absorbed by us as they are absorbed entirely by the investor partners of the vies

similarly  the variance in gain on sale of revenue bonds relates to the level of repayments in the portfolio investing segment 
see results by segment below 
equity in earnings of investments is principally comprised of dividends from our investment in arcap investors  llc 
in  this amount also includes losses from tax advantaged investment vehicles similar to those we sponsor 
the total income allocated to preferred shareholders for and  including the portion classified as interest expense  increased as compared to due to additional preferred offerings consummated in june and april the income allocation to scus represents the portion of our consolidated earnings attributed to holders of the new class of equity issued at the time of the rcc acquisition in the fourth quarter of  as if those shares were all converted to common equity 
income taxes a large majority of our pre tax income is derived from our portfolio investing businesses  which are structured as partnership entities  as such  income from those investments is not subject to taxes 
conversely  our businesses that generate taxable income are corporations operating with financial losses due to their absorption of most company costs and expenses as well as tax deductible distributions on their subsidiary equity 
we provide for income taxes for these corporate subsidiaries in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax benefit disclosed relates to the financial losses of those businesses 
as the proportion of our pre tax income contributed by the businesses generating taxable income and losses changes  the resulting tax benefit or provision may appear incongruous with our consolidated income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was in  in and in the effective rate for our corporate subsidiaries that were subject to taxes was in  in and in the substantially higher rates for the corporate subsidiaries in and as compared to resulted from factors that pertain to our transition from an externally managed entity with little taxable income to one with significant taxable income streams  deferred tax adjustments attributable to the timing of revenue receipts and deductible costs 
many of these factors disproportionately affected the effective rate in and because of a comparatively low level of taxable income on which the ratio was calculated

we continued to expand our revenue bond portfolio in and  although the rate of investment slowed due to challenging market conditions in whereby some potential investments did not meet our underwriting standards 
while we saw deferments by texas developers that shifted a substantial level of acquisitions until just after the end of the year  in we expanded our presence in california  the nation s largest bond market  and originated investments in new markets in arizona  massachusetts  kentucky and new york 
s while the decline in interest rates has gradually lowered the average yield of our portfolio  from a profit perspective  the low interest rate environment has been favorable for us in and as compared to the bond market association bma rate  the short term tax exempt index  continues to be at historic lows  having averaged only in and in our weighted average cost of debt associated with these investments was approximately at december   and approximately at december   taking into effect our current hedging 
we continue to recognize healthy spreads between our cost of borrowing and the interest rates on our revenue bonds 
the interest rates on our tax exempt first mortgage bonds for had a weighted average permanent coupon rate of and our entire tax exempt first mortgage bond portfolio had a weighted average coupon rate of at december  other income in this segment is predominantly interest income on investments other than revenue bonds and intercompany royalty fees eliminated in consolidation 
the increase in over the prior years is due largely to capri loan interest see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fund management the table below shows selected information regarding our fund management activities in thousands equity raised   equity invested by investment funds   fund sponsorship fees   credit enhancement fees    other revenues   total    prior to intercompany eliminations 
our fund management activities generate origination and acquisition fees associated with sponsoring tax credit equity investment funds and for assisting the funds in acquiring assets  which we recognize when the equity is invested by the investment fund 
we also receive asset management fees for the services we perform for the funds once they are operating  which we recognize over the service periods 
the increase in fund sponsorship fees represents our full year of owning rcc in  while includes only the period following the november acquisition 
on a pro forma basis  comparing the period to the full period  as if we had owned rcc as of january  the pro forma period  fund sponsorship revenues increased approximately 
rcc had a record year in  with originations exceeding billion  representing an increase of over the pro forma period 
the increase in business reflects a strong appetite among corporate investors for the type of funds we sponsor  as well as the growth of our product offerings  including the introduction of funds specifically designed for investors seeking state tax credits 
we earn partnership management and o o fees based upon the level of equity we raise for tax credit equity funds 
fees earned for partnership management and o o services increased approximately to million over the pro forma period 
this increase exceeded the rise in equity raised due to higher average allowance rates realized as a result of the higher proportion of proprietary single investor and guaranteed funds in the total mix of fund equity raised in as compared to during  the million of equity invested by investment funds represented an increase of over the pro forma period 
we earn property acquisition fees and acquisition allowance fees based upon the level of fund equity invested 
fees earned for property acquisition and equity origination services associated with tax credit equity fund sponsorship increased to approximately million in  representing an approximate increase compared to the pro forma period results 
while these fees are earned based on investment activity  the increase exceeded the increase in investments due to a higher rate of fees realized as a result of the fund composition  as noted above 
also during  rcc acted as advisor for million of investment originations by chartermac entities and others  compared to million of such originations for the pro forma period 
we recognize acquisition fees in this segment for such services  which declined approximately compared pro forma period due to the lower level of investment activity overall 
additionally  the average acquisition fees recognized were lower because of a higher proportion of investment originations for entities outside of chartermac in as compared to due to the lower acquisition fee rate rcc receives for those acquisitions 
partnership and asset management fees increased to million in  representing an increase of approximately over the pro forma period  attributable to the higher level of assets under management 
the increase in credit enhancement fees relates to acceleration of the credit enhancement business 
in  we completed four transactions to guarantee tax benefits to investors  and continued to earn fees from three transactions completed in and these fees are recognized over an average of years  accordingly we expect to recognize increased revenues going forward as we expand this business 
the increase in other revenues reflects the impact of the rcc acquisition  whereby we recorded revenues for miscellaneous service that rcc provides to funds it manages 
on a comparable basis  these revenues increased approximately in over the pro forma period 
mortgage banking the table below shows selected information regarding our mortgage banking activities for the year ended december  in thousands originations    total loans serviced    mortgage servicing rights    mortgage origination fees    mortgage servicing fees    other revenues    originations in increased over the level  marking an all time high volume for cmc 
the increased volume in was driven by a determined focus on expanding the freddie mac platform  including approximately million of affordable housing transactions and significant levels of portfolio originations 
in addition  we diversified our funding with a higher proportion of conduit lending and other funding avenues outside the traditional fannie mae and freddie mac funding sources 
also  the expansion of product offerings  including early rate lock products  and the growth of our origination team helped to push this business to the record levels 
the decline in originations in of resulted from heightened competition and a resultant decline in market share 
such competition caused a larger decline in origination fees as average fees were reduced in response to the market conditions 
the increase in origination fees was lower than the increase in originations because certain of the portfolio originations in were opportunistically priced at lower than standard fee rates 
originations for the three years ended december are broken down as follows of of of total total total fannie mae    freddie mac    fha   assumptions    conduit bank    other   total    despite the high volume of originations in  our servicing portfolio declined slightly during the year due to an unusually high volume of loans paid off during the year and a high percentage of originations for loans without associated servicing 
while loan originations declined in compared to  nearly three quarters of the loans closed in were new loans rather than portfolio refinancings  which added valuable new servicing to the portfolio 
more than of the originations were additive to the portfolio 
the growth in the portfolio in also reflects a sub servicing agreement with creditre which added million of serviced loans to our business 
despite the decline in the year end servicing portfolio level  the servicing fees increase in was due to a higher average portfolio during when compared to the higher average resulted from the sub servicing agreement noted above  which began in april  while the loans were included for all of additionally  more than half of the loan payoffs during occurred in the second half of the year 
the fee increase in resulted from the growth in the portfolio  although the lower percentage increase in fees than in the portfolio balance was due to the mid year addition of the sub serviced portfolio discussed above 
with the addition of capri capital funding ccf in see subsequent events  below  we expect significant growth in revenues in this segment  with the addition of a servicing portfolio of approximately billion and access to numerous new origination regions upon acquiring licenses owned by ccf 
vies the results of vies reflected in our financial statements are those of entities we are considered to control according to the definitions of fin r  but in which we have no equity interest 
our fund management segment earns fees from the entities  however  and our portfolio investing business earns interest on several revenue bonds for which vies are the obligors 
the vies are primarily tax credit equity investment funds we sponsor and manage 
the results we reported in reflect nine months of operations for the vies we consolidated upon our initial adoption of fin r effective march   as well as any new funds closed after that date for the full periods they were in operation 
as third party investors hold all the equity partnership interests in these entities  we allocate all results of operations to those partners 
as a result  these vies have no impact on our net income 
inflation inflation did not have a material effect on our results for the periods presented 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our ongoing business including investments primarily with cash provided by operations  securitization of investments and revolving or warehouse credit facilities 
our primary sources of capital to meet long term liquidity needs including acquisitions are debt and various types of equity offerings  including equity of our subsidiaries 
we believe that our financing capacity and cash flow from current operations are adequate to meet our current and projected liquidity requirements 
nonetheless  as business needs warrant  we may issue other types of debt or equity in the future 
debt and securitizations we have entered into the following bridge loans and revolving warehouse facilities o million  used for mortgage banking needs  which is renewable annually  o million  used to fund investments in revenue bonds on a short term basis  which matures march   with a built in accordion feature allowing up to a million increase and a one year extension at our option  o million  used to acquire equity interests in property ownership entities prior to the inclusion of these equity interests into investments funds  which matures on october   with a one year extension at our option  o million  used to provide the interim loan to capri  which matures in july  and o million  established in connection with the cmc acquisition  which expires december  we also use floating rate securitization programs to leverage our portfolio of revenue bonds to generate capital for the acquisition of additional revenue bonds 
in each of our securitization programs  we contribute revenue bonds into trusts  which are generally credit enhanced by investment grade rated third party entities and then floating rate certificates are sold out of the trust 
we retain a residual interest in each of the trusts 
we use two primary securitization programs mbia securitizations and the p floats rites program 
o under our mbia securitizations  pools of bonds are contributed into trusts  which are credit enhanced by mbia  a large financial insurer  and then low floater certificates are sold 
the low floater certificates have an interest rate that is reset weekly floating rate or an interest rate that is reset periodically based on a dutch auction process auction rate securitizations 
mbia has agreed to provide us with up to million in credit enhancement through using the mbia credit enhancement we can complete up to million of floating rate securitizations and million of auction rate securitization 
at december   we had million of floating rate securitization and million of auction rate securitizations outstanding 
o in the p floats rites program  merrill lynch deposits individual revenue bonds into a special purpose trust and provides a credit enhancement guarantee enabling the trust to sell a weekly reset floating rate security 
we are required to post additional bonds with merrill lynch as collateral for the credit enhancement provided 
at december   we had approximately million of outstanding revenue bonds and approximately million of a certificates of various trusts under the p floats program 
during  we completed a new fixed rate securitization  whereby we sold million of two year certificates with a fixed rate of collateralized by million bonds and requiring no credit enhancement 
our continued ability to raise capital through the use of securitization programs is dependent on o the availability of bonds to be used in securitizations or as excess collateral  o the depth of the market of buyers for tax exempt floating rate investments  and o our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with credit enhancers and liquidity providers 
we continue to actively manage our balance sheet and our relationships to mitigate the impact of the factors listed above and to continue to diversify our sources of capital 
our debt financing facilities are more fully described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
while the mortgage banking warehouse facility  the fund management warehouse facility  the equity issuer revolving line and the line of credit associated with the capri loan all mature in  we expect to renew  replace or refinance all of them 
additionally  the fixed rate securitization program matures in and we intend to remarket it through the p floats rites program 
as of december   we had approximately million available to borrow under these debt and securitization facilities without exceeding limits imposed by debt covenants and our trust agreement 
equity other than our common shares  we have several classes of equity outstanding  with varying claims upon our income and cash flows o convertible community reinvestment act preferred shares convertible cra shares  o preferred shares of equity issuer some of which are subject to mandatory repurchase  and o special common units scus of our subsidiary  chartermac capital company llc ccc 
the convertible cra shares are economically equivalent to our common shares  receiving the same dividend 
unlike the common shares  however  these shares are not publicly traded and do not have voting rights but entitle the holders to credit under the us government s community reinvestment act 
these shares are convertible into common shares at the holders option 
we first issued convertible cra shares during and the program has since become increasingly popular with a broad range of banks that invest in our shares to both make an investment in us and to make qualifying community reinvestment act investments 
at december   banks had invested in our convertible cra shares and we believe they remain a viable method to raise capital 
the preferred shares of equity issuer entitle their holders to a claim on the income and cash flows of a portion of our portfolio investing business 
they have no voting rights with respect to chartermac and are not convertible into chartermac common shares 
the scus entitle their holders to a claim on the income and cash flows of our subsidiaries through which we operate our fund sponsorship business 
the scus have no direct voting rights with respect to chartermac  but all of the holders also have special preferred voting shares of chartermac  which have voting rights equivalent to our common shares 
the scus are convertible into common shares and are entitled to tax adjusted dividends based on the common dividend rate 
in october  we filed a shelf registration with the sec providing for the issuance of up to million in common shares  preferred shares and debt securities 
the shelf registration was declared effective on march  we have no current plans to draw upon this shelf registration but may as opportunities or business requirements dictate 
further information about our equity instruments is included in note and to our consolidated financial statements

summary of cash flows vs 
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents during was lower than the increase in  primarily due to increased investing outflows  although those investing activities were funded from a higher proportion of operating cash flows as compared to financing cash flows than in operating cash flows were higher in the period by a margin of million 
this increase resulted from a higher level of earnings exclusive of non cash expenses  which increased substantially following our acquisition of rcc late in additionally  the timing of receipts and payments in operating asset and liability accounts contributed to this increase 
investing outflows increased by million in as compared to a lower level of revenue bond acquisition and funding activity was partially offset by our loan to capri 
in addition  in we received a much higher level of revenue bond repayments as compared to the current year 
the level of repayments in stemmed from the expiration of lockout periods for older revenue bonds  with no comparable occurrence in financing inflows in the period were lower than in by million 
the primary reason for the higher inflows in was the level of securitization borrowings to finance the investment level in that year 
a higher amount of proceeds from equity offerings in the current year were partially offset by the resulting increase in distributions to shareholders 
in addition  also included payments to scu holders  with none in as the scus were issued in november of that year 
vs 
the million net increase in cash and cash equivalents in as compared to resulted from increased operating and financing cash flows as well as decreased investing outflows 
operating cash flows increased by million in as compared to the level 
the increase was attributable in large part to the addition of business lines from the rcc acquisition and the resultant cash inflows that rcc generated at the end of the year 
these cash flows  which resulted in a significant increase in the level of deferred income balances  offset the incremental costs now included in operating cash flows upon the internalization of management associated with this acquisition  as well as higher deferred tax liabilities 
investing outflows in decreased by million as compared to despite the cash paid as part of the rcc acquisition  funds flow benefited from sharply lower restricted cash requirements as we replaced cash collateralizing our securitization programs with revenue bond investments 
additionally  a sharp reduction in mortgage loan receivables in benefited the cash flows in this category 
this reduction stemmed from a very high level of originations late in  which were not settled and sold until early late originations  on the other hand  were much lower than in  leading to the net decrease in the mortgage loans receivable asset 
financing inflows in were million higher than in this was primarily a result of restructuring and expanding our securitization capabilities and taking advantage of these facilities to monetize our revenue bond investment portfolio to expand our business  as well as borrowings to finance the rcc acquisition 
in comparison  during we relied more on equity capital to finance our growth 
liquidity requirements after december  during january  distributions of approximately million at various per share amounts were paid to holders of preferred shares 
during february  distributions of approximately million per share were paid to holders of common and convertible cra shares and million were paid to scu holders 
these distributions were declared in december in the first quarter of  we paid approximately million to purchase the portion of cmc that we did not own at december  and approximately million will be paid as part of the capri loan conversion and acquisition transactions see subsequent events below 
management is not aware of any trends or events  commitments or uncertainties  which have not otherwise been disclosed that will or are likely to impact liquidity in a material way see also contingent liabilities below 
subsequent events in the first quarter of  we converted the loan made to capri in july upon conversion  we held two participating loans  one of which allowed us to participate in the cash flows of  and in turn was convertible into a ownership interest in  ccf 
the other allows us to participate in the cash flows of  and is convertible into a ownership interest in  capri capital advisors cca  a pension fund advisory business 
in the first quarter of  we converted the ccf loan and acquired the business as an addition to our mortgage banking segment 
management currently expects to convert the cca loan into an equity ownership prior to the end of the loan term in august chartermac and capri anticipate that this strategic alliance will benefit us by o diversifying our revenue sources to include additional fee businesses that are less susceptible to changes in the interest rate environment  o expanding our business lines into pension fund advisory and providing cca access to our real estate platform and our balance sheet  o increasing our market share and generating economies of scale through the combined mortgage banking platforms of ccf and cmc  and o cultivating the complementary product offerings of ccf and cmc  thereby establishing a broader array of products for the clients of both firms 
also in the first quarter of  we purchased the of cmc that we had not previously owned  and amac repaid advances we had made to it in contractual obligations the following table provides our commitments as of december  to make future payments under our debt agreements and other contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years notes payable     notes payable of consolidated vies      operating lease obligations      unfunded loan commitments    floating rate securitization   fixed rate securitization   preferred shares of subsidiary subject to mandatory repurchase   total      the amounts included in each category reflect the current expiration  reset or renewal date of each facility or security certificate

off balance sheet arrangements the following table reflects our maximum exposure for guarantees we have entered into and the carrying amounts as of december  maximum carrying in thousands exposure amount payment guarantees  completion guarantees  operating deficit guarantees recapture guarantees  replacement reserve  mortgage pool credit enhancement  lihtc guarantees   mortgage banking loss sharing agreement   these guarantees generally relate to business requirements for developers to obtain construction financing 
as part of our role as co developer of certain properties  we issue these guarantees in order to secure properties as assets for the funds we manage 
to date  we have had minimal exposure to losses under these guarantees and anticipate no material liquidity requirements in satisfaction of any guarantee issued 
we see these guarantees as opportunities to expand our fund management business by offering broad capital solutions to customers 
to date  we have had minimal exposure to losses under these guarantees and anticipate no material liquidity requirements in satisfaction of any guarantee issued 
the carrying values disclosed above relate to the fees we earn for the guarantees  which we recognize as the fair value of the guarantee 
the loss sharing agreement with fannie mae is a normal part of the dus lender program and affords a higher level of fees than we earn for other comparable funding sources 
the carrying value disclosed above is our estimate of potential exposure under the guarantees  although any funding requirements for such exposure is based on the contractual requirements of the underlying loans we sell to fannie mae  which vary as to amount and duration  up to a maximum of years 
the maximum exposure amount is not indicative of our expected losses under the guarantees 
for details of these transactions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions sometimes involve future events which cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  our determination of estimates requires that we exercise our judgment 
while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different results may actually occur and any such differences could be material to our financial statements 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements o valuation of investments in revenue bonds  o valuation of mortgage servicing rights  o impairment of goodwill  and o accounting for income taxes 
valuation of investments in revenue bonds sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  provides guidance on determining the valuation of investments owned 
the initial classification of our investments in the available for sale category rather than as held to maturity is due to a provision in most of the revenue bonds under which we have a right to require redemption prior to maturity  although we can and may elect to hold them up to their maturity dates unless otherwise modified 
because of this classification  we must carry our investments at fair value 
since there is no ready market for these investments  we must exercise judgment in determining what constitutes fair value 
we estimate the fair value by calculating the present value of future payments under the bonds  with a discount rate based upon the average rate of new originations for the quarter leading up to the valuation date 
if the property underlying the bond has substandard performance  a factor is added to the discount rate to allow for the additional risk 
conversely  if the underlying property is performing much better than expected  the discount rate may be reduced to allow for the reduced risk 
in making these determinations  we evaluate  among other factors bonds secured by properties in construction phase o assets where there are issues outstanding regarding timely completion of the construction  even if there is no apparent risk of financial loss 
bonds secured by properties that are in lease up or stabilized phases o stabilization requirements ie  minimum occupancy level and debt service coverage for specified periods not yet met but all completion requirements ie  timely submission of documentation regarding certificates of occupancy  deal waivers  etc  as well as completing construction within the budgeted cost met 
established material variation from anticipated operating performance  ability to meet stabilization test within the allotted time period is in question or material deficiencies at the collateral level  or other weaknesses exist calling into question the viability of the project in the near to intermediate term  or o project viability is in question and defaults exist and notification of such has been delivered 
enhanced possibility of loss may exist or has been specified 
we use these criteria to assess all of our revenue bonds 
in our valuation review  any bonds meeting these criteria are monitored and assessed for risk of financial loss 
if no financial loss is expected  the fair value of a bond is considered to be the lower of outstanding face amount or the present value of future cash flows  with the discount rate adjusted to provide for the applicable risk factors 
if a financial loss is expected  the bond is considered impaired and written down to fair value as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  requires that servicing rights retained when mortgage loans are sold be recorded as assets at fair value and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
significant judgment is required in accounting for these assets  including o determining the fair value of the asset retained when the associated mortgage is sold and in subsequent reporting periods  including such factors as costs to service the loans  the estimated rate of prepayments  the estimated rate of default and an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of cash flows  and o estimating the appropriate proportion and period for amortizing the asset 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value 
we assess our mortgage servicing rights for impairment based on the fair value of the assets as compared to carrying values 
we estimate the fair value by obtaining market information from one of the primary mortgage servicing rights brokers 
to determine impairment  the mortgage servicing portfolio is stratified by the issuer of the underlying mortgage loans and we compare the estimated fair value of each stratum to its recorded book value 
when the recorded value of capitalized servicing assets exceeds fair value  we recognize temporary impairment through a valuation allowance  fair value in excess of the amount capitalized is not recognized 
in addition  we periodically evaluate our mortgage servicing rights for other than temporary impairment to determine whether the carrying value before the application of the valuation allowance is recoverable 
when we determine that a portion of the balance is not recoverable  the asset and the valuation allowance are reduced to reflect permanent impairment 
impairment of goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment regarding the fair value of each reporting unit which is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this  in turn  requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business and the life over which cash flows will occur 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
furthermore  these projected future tax consequences include our assumption as to the continuing tax free nature of a significant portion of our earnings 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as we already follow the fair value provisions set forth in sfas no 
 this statement is expected to have an immaterial impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in certain financial instruments  primarily revenue bonds and other bond related investments that are subject to various forms of market risk  including interest rate risk 
we seek to prudently and actively manage such risks to earn sufficient compensation to justify the undertaking of such risks and to maintain capital levels which are commensurate with the risks we undertake 
the assumptions related to the following discussion of market risk involve judgments involving future economic market conditions  future corporate decisions and other interrelating factors  many of which are beyond our control and all of which are difficult or impossible to predict with accuracy 
although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward looking information are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking information included herein will prove to be accurate 
due to the significant uncertainties inherent in forward looking information  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as our representation that our objectives and plans would be achieved 
interest rate risk the nature of our investments and the instruments used to raise capital for their acquisition expose us to income and expense volatility due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
our exposure to interest rate is twofold o the potential increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt  and o the impact of interest rate on the value of our assets 
impact on earnings our investments in revenue bonds generally bear interest at fixed rates  or pay interest according to the cash flows of the underlying properties  which do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under our floating rate securitization programs vary based on market interest rates based on the bma index and are re set weekly or every days 
in addition  we have floating rate debt related to our acquisition financing and our warehouse facilities  with rates based on libor 
other long term sources of capital  such as our preferred shares of equity issuer  carry a fixed dividend rate and as such  are not impacted by changes in market interest rates 
with the exception of million of debt hedged via an interest rate swap agreement and the million fixed rate securitization  the full amount of our liabilities labeled on our consolidated balance sheet as financing arrangements and notes payable are variable rate debts 
we estimate that an increase of in interest rates would decrease our annual net income by approximately million 
we manage this risk through the use of interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and forward bond origination commitments  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we manage our exposure by striving for diversification in our businesses to include those not susceptible to interest rate changes and by managing our leverage 
impact on valuation of assets a rising interest rate environment could reduce the demand for multifamily tax exempt and taxable financing  which could limit our ability to invest in revenue bonds or to structure transactions 
conversely  falling interest rates may prompt historical renters to become homebuyers  in turn potentially reducing the demand for multifamily housing 
changes in market interest rates would also impact the estimated fair value of our portfolio of revenue bonds 
we estimate the fair value for each revenue bond as the present value of its expected cash flows  using a discount rate for comparable tax exempt investments 
therefore  as market interest rates for tax exempt investments increase  the estimated fair value of our revenue bonds will generally decline  and a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase in their estimated fair values 
for example  we estimate  using the same methodology used to estimate the portfolio fair market value under sfas no 
 that a increase or decrease in market rates for tax exempt investments would change the estimated fair value of our portfolio of revenue bonds by approximately million 
changes in the estimated fair value of the revenue bonds do not impact our reported net income  earnings per share  distributions or cash flows  but are reported as components of other accumulated comprehensive income and affect reported shareholders equity  and may affect our borrowing capability to the extent that collateral requirements are sometimes based on our asset values
