item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains forward looking statements regarding our performance  strategy  plans  objectives  expectations  beliefs and intentions 
the actual outcome of the events described in these forward looking statements could differ materially 
this report  and especially this section and the section entitled risk factors contains a discussion of some of the factors and risks that could contribute to those differences 
general we are a leading specialty retailer of mid to high end audio and video consumer electronics products operating under the tweeter  sound advice  hifi buys  showcase home entertainment and hillcrest names 
we opened our first tweeter store in new england in over years  we have refined our retail concept to meet the needs of consumers seeking brand name products with advanced features  functionality and performance which we sell through our highly trained  relationship driven sales force 
we believe that our effective merchandising and superior customer service have enabled us to generate substantial customer loyalty 
between and we acquired companies within our industry  consisting of a total of stores  in states 
we funded these acquisitions through a combination of private equity investments  debt  an initial public offering  two follow on offerings and the issuance of common stock 
over the past several years we have expanded our corporate infrastructure  including the addition of senior executives in our merchandising  marketing and retail operations functions  to strengthen our management team now responsible for supporting a larger business 
in may we engaged retailmasters  llc retailmasters  a consulting company hired to aid in the development of tools and methods to drive improvements in several areas  including supply chain  sales development and store level operating disciplines 
our goal is to become best in class in these foundational areas 
during fiscal  together with retailmasters we accomplished supply chain initiatives that allowed us to improve our inventory management 
in we made a significant investment in new financial systems  acquiring and implementing a new general ledger and accounts payable system  which we expect will enhance our financial controls 
acquiring so many businesses over a nine year span  as described above  resulted in disparate business processes during and following the acquisition periods 
during the course of fiscal and continuing into fiscal  we worked on establishing one common set of standards wherever practical 
we made great strides toward achieving this goal during these two years but we ultimately concluded that certain stores were failing to fit our core operating strategy or meet our profit objectives 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we closed or committed to close eight stores that had a different business model than our core operating strategy and in the third quarter of we announced our intentions to close an additional stores due to their poor operating results 
by the end of fiscal we had closed all of those stores except one  which we closed on october  our expansion plans will be limited until we feel that we are returning to operating profit levels we have achieved in the past excluding our goodwill impairment charge in fiscal  fiscal marked the first operating loss at tweeter in more than ten years 
nevertheless  in january of we opened a new prototype store in las vegas that we believe could be important to our future growth plans 
designed in a home like setting  the store s showroom allows consumers to experience entertainment in notional living room  kitchen  bedroom  bathroom  sports bar  home theater  office and outdoor settings  featuring systems specially designed and configured for enjoying sports  movies and music at home 
initial results from this new store have been encouraging and during fiscal we intend to continue testing this concept by applying certain aspects of this store in ten locations in other parts of the country 
we intend to open three new stores utilizing the full prototype model  convert four existing stores to the full prototype model and convert just the operating procedures in three other existing stores  without investing any capital to physically remodel them 

table of contents toward the end of we reported a turnaround in our comparable store sales 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we generated a broad based comparable store sales increase of  with nine of our sales regions experiencing comparable store sales growth 
this performance allowed us to register a comparable store sales increase of for the full year 
as advanced televisions are becoming more affordable and hdtv content is becoming more available we feel that we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends 
accordingly  we increased our inventory for the christmas holiday shopping season earlier than usual to prepare for what we hope will be a strong season 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items in our consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal periods shown below years ended september  total revenue cost of sales gross profit selling expenses corporate  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges interest expense gain on sale of equity investments income from equity investments  net of tax net loss from continuing operations fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue 
our total revenue includes delivered merchandise  home installation labor  commissions on service contracts sold  completed repair service work  direct business to business sales  delivery charges and internet originated sales 
we use the term comparable store sales to compare year over year sales performance of our stores

in addition  comparable store sales include internet originated sales 
we exclude remodeled or relocated stores from our comparable store sales until they have been operating for full months from the date we completed the remodeling or the date the store re opened after relocation 
in we implemented a store closing program 
we removed those closing stores from the comparable store sales base in may after we determined that they would close 
stores that are part of discontinued operations are also excluded from the comparable store sales base 
our total revenue from continuing operations increased million  or  to million in the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily the result of revenues from new and acquired stores of million  of which million related to the now audio video acquisition that occurred on july  in addition  comparable store sales increased million  or 
the increase in revenue was partially offset by a million reduction in sales associated with direct business to business sales and a million reduction in sales related to closed stores 
within our video category  we experienced a significant increase compared to the prior year in sales from plasma tvs  lcd tvs and furniture  which largely offset a decline in sales from tv monitors  projection tvs  camcorders and dvd equipment

this increase was primarily related to higher contribution from home installation labor and parts  plasma and lcd tvs  cables  remote control devices and furniture 
we were also able to reduce the adverse impact of discount coupons on our gross profit 
these increases were partially offset by lower contribution from projection tvs  tv monitors  dvd equipment and audio speakers and receivers

our selling expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as a percentage of total revenue  selling expenses increased to for the year ended september  from in the prior year period 
the percentage increase was attributable to several factors 
payroll and fringe benefits expenses rose million  driven by increased sales and a larger support staff associated with our growing in home installation business 
advertising costs increased million due to an increase in the number of advertising initiatives 
insurance expense increased million due to an increase in our workers compensation self insurance expenses

amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was  for the years ended september  and non cash compensation charges 
we incurred non cash compensation charges of  and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the expense in fiscal is attributable to equity based executive compensation arrangements 
in fiscal  million is attributable to the value of warrants issued to retailmasters  llc and  represents other equity based compensation arrangements 
restructuring charges

our restructuring charges included million for lease termination fees and other related charges  million for professional fees related to lease termination negotiations and inventory liquidation  million for severance costs and a non cash charge of million related to the write down of leasehold improvements and lease adjustments 
interest income 
our interest income decreased to  for the year ended september  compared to  for the year ended september  during the year ended september   we received  of interest income from suppliers associated with pre payments we made to secure inventory purchases 
there was no such income received during the year ended september  
table of contents interest expense 
our interest expense was million for the year ended september  compared to interest expense of million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in amortization expense associated with loan financing costs 
gain on sale of equity investment 
we realized a gain on sale of equity investment of million for the year ended september  on may   we sold  shares  representing of our total investment  in tivoli audio  llc tivoli for million 
the transaction decreased our total ownership in tivoli from to after completion of the sale 
income tax expense benefit 
we are required to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at september   we have provided a full valuation allowance of approximately million related to net federal and state deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate benefit for the years ended september  and was and  respectively 
in we recorded tax expense of million  million of which related to the establishment of a full valuation allowance on net federal and state deferred tax assets established prior to and the balance of which related to further adjustments of our tax asset and liability accounts 
we provided a valuation allowance on the tax benefit related to the operating loss because of the uncertainty of realization of such benefit 
income from equity investment  net of tax 
our income from equity investment  net of tax increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   reflecting the increased profitability of tivoli 
discontinued operations 
in the third quarter of fiscal we closed or committed to close six stores classified as discontinued operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we closed or committed to close eight stores classified as discontinued operations 
the decision to exit these stores was primarily related to poor operating results 
prior year information has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 
revenue from the closed stores  included in pre tax loss from discontinued operations  amounted to million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the revenue in from discontinued operations was lower than in because eight of the stores classified as discontinued operations were closed by early whereas all were open for nearly all of fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue 
our total revenue from continuing operations increased million  or  to million in the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily the result of revenue from new and renovated stores of million  of which million related to acquisitions  as well as a million increase in insurance replacement and corporate sales 
this was offset by a decline in comparable store sales from continuing operations of million  or  and closed stores of million 
home installation labor revenue as a percentage of revenue increased during the year ended september  from to 
cost of sales and gross profit 
our cost of sales related to continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  our gross profit increased million  or  to million in the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  our gross profit percentages for the years ended september  and were and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit percentage is due primarily to the fact that emerging issues task force eitf was effective for the entire year in fiscal  in comparison to only the last nine months in fiscal the amount of reimbursement received after january  upon the adoption of eitf that was treated as a reduction of cost of goods sold but which would have been recorded as a reduction of advertising expenses prior to eitf amounted to million for the fiscal year ended september  for the year ended september  this amount was million 
in addition  fiscal produced a lower than normal gross margin due to a variety of factors  including i the fact that  in  we undertook a concerted effort to reduce open box and discontinued inventory  which required much higher levels of markdown than 
table of contents usual  ii a reduction in suppliers program funds  due in part  to the fact that the we continued to miss stretch goals throughout fiscal selling expenses 
our selling expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as a percentage of total revenue  selling expenses increased to for the year ended september  from in the prior year period 
the percentage increase was primarily attributable to the fact that eitf was effective for the entire year in fiscal in comparison to only the last nine months in fiscal the adoption of eitf requires that vendor allowances associated with the purchase of inventory  which were previously recorded as a reduction of selling expenses  be treated as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
in addition  our compensation and occupancy costs increased in fiscal corporate  general and administrative expenses 
our corporate  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended september  as a percentage of total revenue  corporate  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended september  from for the prior year period 
the increase was primarily due to increases in professional and consulting fees  compensation and miscellaneous expenses 
professional fees were up million due to payments to consultants and other professional fees 
compensation increased by million  due in part to the addition of a number of key senior executives and supply chain merchandising staff during fiscal also  expenses increased million due to hurricane damage as well as costs related to closing locations 
these were offset by an  reduction in bad debt expense and a  reduction in utilities  as well as other minor changes 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was  for the years ended september   and non cash compensation charges 
we incurred non cash compensation charges of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
in fiscal  million is attributable to the value of warrants issued to retailmasters  llc  a consulting company hired to aid in the development of tools and methods to drive supply chain improvements 
in addition  for the years ended september  and   and million  respectively  represents other equity based compensation arrangements 
interest income 
our interest income was  for the year ended september  compared to  for the year ended september  the increase is mainly due to interest income paid by suppliers on prepayments to secure inventory purchases 
in addition  there was  of interest income received for both overpayments on federal income taxes and interest accrued on construction escrow deposits for the year ended september  interest expense 
our interest expense was million for the year ended september  compared to interest expense of million for the year ended september  this fluctuation is due primarily to the increased average level of borrowings on our revolving credit agreement during the year ended september  income tax expense benefit 
the effective tax rate benefit for the years ended september  and was 
income from equity investment  net of tax 
our income from equity investment  net of tax increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   reflecting the increased profitability of tivoli 
discontinued operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we closed  sold or committed to close eight stores 
we completed the store closures by december  the incremental cost related to these store closings amounted to  we incurred  of additional incremental costs related to these store closings in fiscal prior year information has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 
revenue from the closed stores  including six additional stores closed in  amounted to million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources in each of the last four fiscal years we have experienced losses from continuing operations 
further  in  million cash was used in operating activities 
the losses have been funded principally by cash from bank borrowings  proceeds from the sale of a portion of our tivoli investment in only  the sale and leaseback of facilities and improved management of inventories and receivables 
in order to return to profitability and positive cash flows from operations  we have restructured our organization  closed under performing stores  improved our supply chain initiatives and invested in our information technology infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that these initiatives will result in a return to profitability and positive cash flow 
our cash needs are primarily to support our inventory requirements and capital expenditures  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores  remodeling or relocating older stores and to fund operating losses in recent years 
our net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended september  we incurred a net loss of million in the year  although million of our net loss was for non cash charges consisting of million for depreciation and amortization  million for the write off of our deferred income tax provision and million for an impairment charge related to our closing of stores during the year 
we believe that we have opportunities to improve our cash from operating activities in by improving our profitability  reducing our accounts receivable and increasing our inventory turnover 
our net cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  was million 
approximately million was used to purchase property and equipment  which was partially offset by million in proceeds from sale of equity investments 
capital expenditures were approximately million for real estate projects  most of which was spent to open five new stores  million for systems projects  including our new general ledger and accounts payable system and million was used on other store related capital projects  approximately half of which was spent on display fixtures 
capital expenditures for the next twelve months are projected to be million  including million to remodel and renovate existing stores  million for new stores  million for information technology  million for vehicles to support our expanding home installation business and distribution centers  and million for all other capital expenditure programs 
our net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  was million 
proceeds of long term debt were million and the increase in the short term portion of long term debt was million 
our senior secured revolving credit facility credit facility  as amended july   provides for up to million in revolving credit loans and million in term loans 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains various covenants and restrictions  including that i we cannot create  incur  assume or permit additional indebtedness  ii we cannot create  incur  assume or permit any lien on any property or asset  iii we cannot merge or consolidate with any other person or permit any other person to merge or consolidate with us  iv we cannot purchase  hold or acquire any investment in any other person except those specifically permitted  v we cannot sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of any asset except permitted exceptions  and vi we cannot declare or make any restricted payments  which includes any dividend or certain other distributions 
borrowings are restricted to applicable advance rates based principally on eligible receivables  inventory and real estate values  reduced by a million reserve  a portion of customer deposits and outstanding letters of credit 
at september   million was available for future borrowings 
the facility expires on april  the interest rate on our revolving credit loans ranges from to over libor or over the prime rate  depending on our commitment at various dates during the course of the agreement 
in addition  there is a commitment fee of for the unused portion of the line 
our term loans are in two tranches tranche a and tranche b 
the tranche a term loan is for million at an interest rate of either over the prime rate or over libor  whichever rate we choose 
the tranche b term loan is for 
table of contents million at an interest rate of over the prime rate or  whichever is greater 
neither term loan will require any scheduled principal payments until maturity 
our weighted average interest rates on all outstanding borrowings for the years ended september  and were approximately and  respectively 
the following table lists our contractual obligations at september  payments due by period within within within after total year years years years long term debt  including interest capital lease obligations operating leases real estate vehicles name in title sponsorships total interest was estimated through april   the maturity date of the debt  assuming borrowing levels and interest rates as of september  in addition  at september  we had outstanding purchase orders totaling  for the acquisition of inventory that was scheduled for delivery after september  we are also obligated to certain officers under employment and severance agreements in the event such officers were to be terminated without cause 
we believe that our existing cash  together with cash generated by operations and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
furthermore  due to the seasonality of our business  our working capital needs are significantly higher in the fiscal first and second quarters and there is the possibility that this could cause unforeseen capital constraints in the future 
within our credit facility  there is an option during our peak holiday season buying periods to have more availability on our credit line to meet these needs 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  we cannot predict accurately the effect of inflation on future operating results 
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of our total revenue and net income for the year during the first and second fiscal quarters  with a majority of net income for such quarters realized in the first fiscal quarter 
due to the importance of the holiday shopping season  any factors negatively impacting the holiday selling season could have an adverse effect on our revenue and our ability to generate a profit 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including the timing of new store openings and acquisitions and unexpected changes in volume related rebates or changes in cooperative advertising policies from manufacturers 
in addition  operating results may be negatively affected by increases in merchandise costs  price changes in response to competitive factors and unfavorable local  regional or national economic developments that result in reduced consumer spending 

table of contents critical accounting policies presented below is a discussion about our application of critical accounting policies that require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and where different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management has identified the following accounting estimates as critical for tweeter  and will discuss them separately below allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence provision  income tax accruals  self insurance reserves  and deferred cash discounts  volume rebates and coop advertising 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts reserve most of our accounts receivable are due from our suppliers and less than are due from retail customers 
our net accounts receivable balance at september  of million constitutes of our total assets and our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve of million is of gross accounts receivable 
we increased the reserve to million at september  from  at september  as we fell behind in our collection efforts due to the support required to implement our new financial system 
we categorize our accounts receivable by business type and estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve using four aging classifications current  days  days and over days 
for each business type  based on the amounts in each aging category  we apply a percentage to determine the amount of the reserve to be applied to each category 
if a further review of a business type shows that this methodology needs to be adjusted  the percentage of reserve is adjusted accordingly 
estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant management judgment 
it is possible that doubtful accounts write offs could increase significantly in the future 
we have historically estimated our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the aging categories  which could differ materially if the historical trend changed 
in addition  different reserve estimates that we reasonably could have used would have had a material impact on our reported accounts receivable balance and thus would have had a material impact on the presentation of the results of operations 
for those reasons  and in view of the fact that our accounts receivable balance is of our total assets at september   we believe that the accounting estimate related to doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate 
inventory obsolescence reserve inventory represents million  or of our total assets at september  our profitability and viability are highly dependent on the demand for our products 
an imbalance between purchasing levels and sales could cause rapid and material obsolescence  and loss of competitive price advantage and market share 
we believe that our product mix has provided sufficient diversification to mitigate this risk 
at the end of each reporting period  we reduce the value of our inventory by our estimate of what we believe to be obsolete  and we recognize an expense of the same amount  which is included in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations 
in our industry  merchandise models change periodically 
when we replace an item in our assortment we reclassify the old model into a discontinued category 
generally  we attempt to sell these discontinued models at standard retail prices 
in estimating our obsolescence reserve  we analyze the sales of discontinued merchandise by department and determine what profit or loss was recorded in the quarter 
if product of the discontinued department is sold for below cost during the quarter  then we apply that negative percentage to the value of the inventory on hand as of the balance sheet date 
in addition to this reserve we also identify the selling costs to be incurred in the sale of such discontinued inventory and add that to this obsolescence reserve 

table of contents we also evaluate the obsolescence of our service parts inventory based on the aging of this inventory 
we apply a percentage to each aging category in order to determine the reserve amount 
as a result of a combination of the factors described above  we have reduced our net inventory value to reflect our estimated amount of inventory obsolescence 
our inventory obsolescence reserve at september  is million  compared to million at september  the increase in our reserve reflects an earlier conversion to new items in our fall inventory assortment than in the prior year 
had we not done so  our discontinued inventory and our reserve for obsolete inventory would have been lower at september  than at september  it is also possible that obsolescence could rapidly become a significant issue in the future 
in addition  different reserve estimates that we reasonably could have used would have had a material impact on our reported net inventory and cost of sales  and thus would have had a material impact on the presentation of our results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate 
income taxes our estimate of the expense or benefit and the sufficiency of the income tax accrual are somewhat dependent on our assessment of certain tax filing exposures 
we provide for potential tax exposures arising from routine audits by taxing authorities 
it is reasonably possible to assume that actual amounts payable as a result of such audits could be materially different from amounts accrued in the consolidated balance sheet 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at march   we evaluated our recorded deferred tax assets and determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the deferred tax benefits related to those assets 
accordingly  we provided a full valuation allowance 
we based that determination  in part  on our trend of continuing losses and consideration of store closings 
we provided a valuation allowance of approximately million related to net federal and state deferred tax assets as of september  based on our valuation at that time 
in future periods we will re evaluate the likelihood of realizing benefits from the deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance as deemed necessary 
further  based on our recent history of operating losses  we did not provide any tax benefit on the losses 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for workers compensation  auto garage  general liability insurance and medical dental benefits and evaluate our liability estimate on a quarterly basis based on actuarial information and experience 
historical claims are reviewed as to when they are incurred versus when they are actually paid and an average claims lag is determined 
once the average historical lag is determined  it is applied to the current level of claims being processed 
management believes  and experience has confirmed  the underwriting cost reductions outweigh the financial risk incurred by self insurance of workers compensation  auto garage  general liability and medical dental benefits 
accounting standards require that a related loss contingency be recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
we determined that the total future liability related to claims that have already been incurred but have not been billed is million compared to our estimate last year of million 
most of this increase was due to a refinement in the estimation of the average historical lag described above 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to assessment of future liability for current insurance claims is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement that our management make assumptions about future costs of claims based on historical costs 
deferred cash discounts  volume rebates and coop advertising we receive cash discounts for timely payment of merchandise invoices and recognize these amounts in our statement of operations upon the sale of the inventory 
the amount of the deferral for discounts received 
table of contents but not yet recognized in income is million as of september   compared to million as of september  and is classified as a reduction in gross inventory in the consolidated balance sheet 
we also receive substantial funds from our suppliers for volume rebates and coop advertising 
these funds can be earned in two ways  the first is based on levels of inventory purchases and the second is based on performance of specific advertising activities 
amounts earned based on levels of inventory purchases are recognized in the statement of operations based on when the inventory from each supplier is sold 
amounts earned based on performance of specific advertising activities are recognized in the statement of operations as these activities are performed 
the amount of the deferral for amounts received related to levels of inventory purchases is million as of september   compared to million as of september  no amounts were deferred as of september  for specific advertising activities as we did not have any unfulfilled obligations in relation to cash received prior to the year end 
many of our agreements include stretch goals where the level of funds earned is dependent upon achieving certain purchase levels 
we recognize these program funds in the statement of operations and as a reduction of inventory costs when we determine that we are likely to achieve the goal 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to deferred cash discounts  volume rebates and coop advertising is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in inventory levels  the supplier mix of the inventory on hand  and the timing of performance of specific advertising activities in relation to when the cash for these activities is received 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which requires the recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements and measurement based on the grant date fair value of the award 
it also requires the cost to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award presumptively the vesting period 
statement r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
 and its related interpretations 
statement r is effective for periods beginning after june  we will adopt statement r on october  as required 
we have chosen the modified prospective application mpa method for implementing statement r 
under the mpa method  new awards will be valued and accounted for prospectively upon adoption 
outstanding prior awards that are unvested as of october  will be recognized as compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period 
prior periods will not be restated 
adoption of statement r will not affect our cash flow or financial position  but it will reduce our reported net income and earnings per share 
adopting statement r will result in our recording compensation cost for employee stock options and employee share purchase rights 
on september   our board of directors approved the full acceleration of the vesting of each otherwise unvested outstanding stock option granted under our and stock option and incentive plans and our long term incentive plan for those grants whose strike price was higher than the closing market value of a share of our common stock on that date 
as a result  options to purchase approximately  shares  including approximately  options held by our executive officers and directors became immediately exercisable  effective as of september  the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made primarily to minimize future compensation expense that we would otherwise recognize in our consolidated statements of operations upon the effectiveness of statement r 
as a result of the acceleration  stock option expense will be reduced by approximately million in   in and  in in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when 
table of contents incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated 
the adoption of fin in the first quarter of fiscal is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments and in our financial position is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates  principally related to our borrowings 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
at september   we had million of variable rate borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loans 
a hypothetical change in interest rates for this variable rate debt  based on the september  balances outstanding  would have an annual impact on our interest expense of approximately
