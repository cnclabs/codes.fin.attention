item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the company s consolidated financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and results of operations 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources parent company liquidity leucadia national corporation the parent is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries  cash and cash equivalents and other non controlling investments in debt and equity securities 
the parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value 
accordingly  while the parent does not have any material arrangement  commitment or understanding with respect thereto except as disclosed in this report  further acquisitions  divestitures  investments and changes in capital structure are possible 
its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources  liquid investments  bank borrowings  public and private capital market transactions  repayment of subsidiary advances  funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments  management and other fees  and borrowings and dividends from its regulated and non regulated subsidiaries 
as of december   the parent s readily available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  excluding amounts held by its regulated subsidiary and non regulated subsidiaries that are parties to agreements which restrict the payment of dividends  totaled  this amount is comprised of cash and short term bonds and notes of the united states government and its agencies of   the equity investment in wmig of  which can be sold privately or otherwise in compliance with the securities laws and have the benefit of a registration rights agreement  and other publicly traded debt and equity securities aggregating  
the investment income realized from these investments is used to meet the parent company s short term recurring cash requirements  which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses 
the parent s only long term cash requirement is to make principal payments on its long term debt  outstanding as of december   of which  is due before   is due in   is due in and  is due in historically  the parent has used its available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments  but the timing of any future investments and the cost can not be predicted 
should the company require additional liquidity for an investment or any other purpose  the parent also has an unsecured bank credit facility of  that matures in and bears interest based on the eurocurrency rate or the prime rate 
no amounts are currently outstanding under the bank credit facility 
in addition  based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers  the company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities 
during  moody s investors services and standard poor s each downgraded the parent s debt obligations  and in early  the parent was also downgraded by fitch ratings 
the parent s senior debt obligations are rated two levels below investment grade by moody s investors services and standard poor s  and one level below investment grade by fitch ratings 
ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time 
in april  the parent sold  principal amount of its senior notes due in a private placement transaction at of the principal amount 
the net cash proceeds from the sale of the notes are being used for general corporate purposes 
the parent completed a registered exchange offer pursuant to which each holder of the privately placed senior notes exchanged those notes for publicly registered notes 
also in april  the parent sold  principal amount of its convertible senior subordinated notes due in a private placement transaction 
the notes are convertible into the parent s common shares at per share at any time before their maturity  subject to certain restrictions contained in the notes  at a conversion rate of shares per each  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment an aggregate of  shares 
the net cash proceeds from the sale of the notes are being used for general corporate purposes 
the parent has a currently effective shelf registration statement in respect of the notes and the common shares issuable upon conversion of the notes 
in january  the company exercised an option to sell two of its older corporate aircraft for total proceeds of  the option was received in connection with the purchase of two new corporate aircraft during the company completed the sales in july  and reported a pre tax gain of in  the company invested  in intl  a limited liability company that is invested in a master fund which primarily invests in emerging markets debt and equity securities 
intl and the master fund are managed and controlled by an investment manager who has full discretion over investment and operating decisions 
under gaap  intl is considered a variable interest entity and the company is the primary beneficiary  as a result  the company accounts for its investment in intl as a consolidated subsidiary 
intl plans to sell additional membership interests in the future  which if accomplished could result in the company no longer accounting for intl as a consolidated subsidiary 
the creditors of intl have recourse only to the assets of intl and do not have recourse to any other assets of the company 
the company can generally withdraw its capital account interest upon days notice  subject to the manager s ability to liquidate security positions in an orderly manner 
at december   all of intl s assets were classified as investments and its liabilities were not material 
wiltel became a member of the company s consolidated federal income tax return as of november  wiltel joined the company s tax return with significant nols  substantially all of which are only available to reduce the federal taxable income of wiltel and its subsidiaries  and has substantial other tax attributes and generates substantial deductions primarily depreciation deductions  some of which are also available to offset the federal taxable income of the company and its other subsidiaries 
although the amount of these deductions that can be used to offset the federal taxable income of other members of the company s consolidated tax group is dependent upon a number of factors  including the future taxable income of wiltel and its subsidiaries  the company does not expect it will have material federal income tax liabilities for the foreseeable future 
for more information about wiltel s nols and tax attributes  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the amount and availability of the company s nols and other tax attributes are subject to certain qualifications  limitations and uncertainties 
in order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the nols  the company s certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares 
the restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of a december   b the repeal of section of the internal revenue code or any comparable successor provision or c the beginning of a taxable year of the company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward 
as of march   the company is authorized to repurchase  common shares 
such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market  through block trades or otherwise 
depending on market conditions and other factors  such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice 
except in connection with employees using common shares to pay the exercise price of employee stock options  the company has not repurchased any common shares during the three year period ended december  at december   no amounts were available to the parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiary without regulatory approval 
cash and investments aggregating  are held by non regulated subsidiaries that are parties to agreements which restrict the payment of dividends 
for more information concerning the long term debt of the company and its subsidiaries  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated liquidity in  net cash was provided by operating activities  principally as a result of distributions from associated companies  the pre funding by sbc of certain of wiltel s capital expenditures  the refund of excess federal income tax payments and an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments 
in  net cash was used for operating activities  principally due to corporate overhead expenses  reduced investment income  an increase in the investment in the trading portfolio and a  contribution to the company s defined benefit pension plan 
in  net cash was provided by operating activities  principally as a result of a reduction to the company s investment in the trading portfolio 
at december   wiltel had aggregate cash and investments of  available for use in its operating  investing and financing activities 
substantially all of wiltel s assets have been pledged to secure its outstanding long term debt  principally to secure its obligations under its credit agreement  outstanding as of december  and its mortgage debt  outstanding at december  
in conjunction with a pricing agreement for certain voice services  in january  sbc paid wiltel  for pre funding of certain capital expenditures 
the amount is reflected as a liability on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
during  wiltel expended all of these funds for the equipment specified in the pricing agreement 
the agreement required that wiltel return the funds to sbc if  prior to january   wiltel and sbc entered into an agreement for voice transport pricing through december  since such an agreement was not entered into  during the first quarter of wiltel will recognize the full amount as other income 
in september  wiltel refinanced its existing  credit agreement debt by entering into an amended credit agreement consisting of a  first lien term loan facility  a  second lien term loan facility and a  revolving credit facility which it can no longer draw upon  as discussed below 
wiltel also used  of its cash and investments to repay in full one of the two mortgage notes that was secured by its headquarters building  including accrued interest  reduce the amount outstanding under its credit agreement  reduce the amount outstanding under the other note that is secured by its headquarters building  and pay expenses 
the amended credit agreement has not been guaranteed by the company and is not secured by any of the company s assets other than the assets of wiltel 
the first lien term loan facility requires quarterly principal payments of approximately  commencing december  through june   and quarterly principal payments of  thereafter until final maturity on june  the second lien term loan facility matures on december  however  if wiltel does not refinance its obligations under its outstanding mortgage debt prior to october   then the first lien term loan facility will mature on october   and if such mortgage debt is not refinanced by january   then the second lien term loan facility will mature on january  loans under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based upon either the prime rate or libor  at wiltel s option  plus a specified margin for each loan 
wiltel s obligations under its amended credit agreement are secured by substantially all of its assets other than those assets securing its headquarters building  for which the amended credit agreement lenders have a second priority lien  and its aircraft capital leases 
pursuant to the terms of wiltel s amended credit agreement  sbc s announcement to migrate its ip based and long distance services to the at t network is considered an event which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect as defined in the facility  and as a result wiltel can no longer access its  revolving credit facility 
wiltel does not anticipate needing the  revolving credit facility to meet its present requirements 
the announcement does not have any impact on the  of term loans under wiltel s credit agreement 
however  the credit agreement provides for an event of default if there is any amendment  supplement  modification or termination of any wiltel contract or agreement that has had or could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on wiltel as defined in the credit agreement 
as mentioned above  wiltel is currently engaged in negotiations with sbc with respect to a transition pricing agreement and other matters which  if successfully concluded  may or may not be deemed an event of default under the wiltel credit agreement 
wiltel intends to enter into discussions with its lenders before entering into any new definitive agreement with sbc 
wiltel s mortgage debt which is non recourse to the company  has an interest rate of and requires annual principal payments escalating from approximately  in to approximately  in  a final payment of approximately  is due at maturity in april the wiltel amended credit agreement contains covenants which require wiltel to meet certain operating targets  which it currently meets  and restrictions which limit wiltel s ability to incur additional indebtedness  spend funds on capital expenditures and make certain investments 
the agreement also prohibits wiltel from paying dividends to the company 
the company currently expects that wiltel will be able to meet the operating targets required by its credit agreement through  however  compliance with the operating targets thereafter is uncertain because of sbc s announced intention to migrate its traffic to at t s network 
while wiltel has no material contractual commitments for capital expenditures  it may spend significant amounts each year  principally for network expansion  maintenance and product upgrades 
in addition  wiltel may also incur additional capital expenditures upon the acquisition of new customers or when providing new products to existing customers 
wiltel uses its available cash resources and operating profits to fund its capital expenditure needs 
during  wiltel spent approximately  for capital expenditures  including amounts that were pre funded by sbc and that will be retained by wiltel 
wiltel is a party to various legal actions and claims  and has reserved  for the satisfaction of all litigation 
certain of these actions relate to the rights of way licensed to wiltel in connection with the installation of its fiber optic cable and seek damages from wiltel for failure to obtain all necessary landowner consents 
additional right of way claims may be asserted against wiltel 
the company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of all claims  legal actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect upon wiltel s results of operations  although unfavorable outcomes could significantly impact wiltel s liquidity 
during  wiltel settled litigation for a cash payment of  the  excess of the reserved amount over the amount paid was recognized as other income 
as mentioned above  in february the company s manufacturing division acquired the assets of nsw for approximately  thereby increasing its mix of products and customer base 
the funds for the acquisition were provided from the company s readily available cash resources 
the company s consolidated banking and lending operations had outstanding loans net of unearned finance charges of  and  at december  and  respectively 
these loans were primarily funded by deposits generated by the company s deposit taking facilities and by brokers  which totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
the cash flows generated from the collections on and sales of its loan portfolios have been used to retire these deposits as they matured 
during  the company sold its subprime automobile and collateralized consumer loan portfolios for aggregate cash proceeds of  and sold certain loan portfolios that had been substantially written off for aggregate cash proceeds of  the banking and lending segment is no longer making loans 
operating activities at the banking and lending segment are currently concentrated on maximizing returns on its investment portfolio  collecting and servicing its remaining loan portfolios and discharging deposit liabilities as they come due 
in  aib submitted an application to the state of utah to convert aib s current national charter to a utah state commercial bank charter 
however  in january the state of utah notified aib that it was suspending the application to convert aib s charter until such time as aib has the operational structure in place that is necessary to begin loan originations 
aib does not intend to make these changes 
since aib s application to convert the charter was not approved  and since the occ is requiring aib to begin the regulatory process to surrender its national charter  aib will file a plan with the occ that will ultimately result in the surrender of its national bank charter 
no assurance can be given that the occ will approve aib s plan of voluntary liquidation or that it will not take other adverse regulatory action 
the company s debt instruments require maintenance of minimum tangible net worth  limit distributions to shareholders and limit indebtedness and funded debt as such terms are defined in the agreements 
in addition  the debt instruments contain limitations on investments  liens  contingent obligations and certain other matters 
the company is in compliance with all of these restrictions  and the company has the ability to incur additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions 
certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the company also contain restrictions which require the maintenance of financial covenants  impose restrictions on the ability to pay dividends to the company and or provide collateral to the lender 
for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as shown below  at december   the company s contractual cash obligations totaled  payments due by period in thousands less than contractual cash obligations total year years years after years customer banking deposits    long term debt      estimated interest expense on long term debt      estimated payments related to derivative financial instruments      planned funding of pension and post retirement obligations    operating leases  net of sublease income      asset purchase obligations  operations and maintenance obligations      other long term contractual obligations      total contractual cash obligations      the estimated interest expense on long term debt includes estimated interest related to variable rate debt which the company determined using rates in effect at december  estimated payments related to a currency swap agreement are based on the currency rate in effect at december  material contractual obligations that are not included in the table above are the company s deferred revenue obligations  and the consolidated pension liability 
deferred revenue obligations do not require the expenditure of material incremental cash  however  they do require wiltel to maintain its network for the benefit of itself and the other contracting party 
except for expected funding of  in  the pension liability is excluded from the table because the timing of cash payments  if any  cannot be predicted 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating  pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the company sold cds holding corporation cds to homefed in  the company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the san elijo hills project 
these bonds  which are for the benefit of the city of san marcos  california and other government agencies  are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project 
cds is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds 
should the city or others draw on the bonds for any reason  cds and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the company for the amount drawn 
at december   the amount of outstanding bonds was   of which expires in   in and the remainder in subsidiaries of the company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating  at december   principally to secure various obligations 
all of these letters of credit expire during the company s remaining guarantee at december  is a  indemnification given to a lender to a certain real estate property 
the amount borrowed under this real estate financing is reflected as long term debt in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
the following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the company s financial statements  and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect  at a specific point in time  events whose ultimate outcome won t be known until a later date 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
historically  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment would increase income in such period 
similarly  if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred taxes in the future  an adjustment would be charged to income in such period 
the company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the company s assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions 
subsequent to the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of wiltel  wiltel became a member of the company s consolidated tax return 
as discussed above  wiltel has significant tax attributes  some of which are available to offset the future taxable income of other members of the company s consolidated federal income tax return 
the company established a valuation allowance that fully reserved for all of wiltel s net deferred tax assets  reduced by an amount equal to the company s current and deferred federal income tax liabilities as of the date of acquisition see allocation of the purchase price in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
except as discussed in results of operations below  before the company can recognize a net deferred tax asset  it will need to demonstrate that on a pro forma combined basis with wiltel it will have had positive cumulative pre tax income over a period of years 
at that time  any decrease to the valuation allowance will be based significantly upon the company s assumptions and projections of its future income  which are inherently uncertain 
during each of the last three years  the company has adjusted its reserve for contingent tax liabilities and reduced income tax expense upon the conclusion of audits by various taxing jurisdictions or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations for the examination of the company s tax returns 
the adjustments have been material  reflecting the inherent difficulty of accurately estimating and accruing for the ultimate resolution of tax contingencies 
the company expects that adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes and contingent tax liabilities could be made in the future and  if such adjustments are made  they could be material 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether a long lived asset or asset group is recoverable is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset as compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying amount of the asset is considered to be not recoverable 
the amount of the impairment recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value for the asset or asset group and recording a provision for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
as of december   the carrying amount of the company s investment in the mineral rights and mining properties of mk resources was approximately  the recoverability of this asset is entirely dependent upon the success of mk resource s mining project at the las cruces copper deposit in the pyrite belt of spain 
mining will be subject to obtaining required permits  obtaining both debt and equity financing for the project  engineering and construction 
in addition  the actual price of copper  the operating cost of the mine and the capital cost in us dollars to build the project and bring the mine into production will affect the recoverability of this asset 
the las cruces project has been granted government subsidies of million euros  however  the grants require mk resources to make certain capital expenditures by march   a deadline that it will not be able to meet principally because of delays in obtaining permits 
las cruces has filed a request to further extend the deadline  but has been informed that the government will not act on the extension request prior to the current expiration 
to date  the company has been the sole source of funding for the las cruces project 
the amount of equity capital and third party financing that can be obtained for the project and its related cost will be significantly affected by the assessment of potential investors and lenders of the current and expected future market price of copper  as well as current market conditions for this type of investment 
during  mk resources was unsuccessful in raising equity capital for the project  due to unfavorable market conditions at the time 
mk resources continues to explore financing possibilities 
based on the current status of the project  mk resource s estimate of future cash flows and its assessment of financing possibilities  the company believes the carrying amount of its investment is recoverable 
however  if the company is unable to obtain the permits required to begin construction of the mine and commence mining activities  is unable to obtain financing for the project or the capital cost of the project changes significantly  it is likely that this investment will be impaired 
at december   the carrying amount of the company s investment in its manufacturing facility located in belgium was approximately  the belgium facility  which became operational in the third quarter of  has not yet achieved the level of revenues and profitability originally expected by the company  primarily due to the segment s loss of a major multi national customer and insufficient demand from other customers 
during  a new general manager was hired at the facility to develop and implement marketing and sales initiatives directed at generating revenue growth 
operating results at the facility improved during as sales grew significantly compared to and the business achieved positive cash flow 
however  new customer acquisitions must continue in order for the facility to reach profitability 
based on the current business plan  which includes estimates of revenue growth  the company believes that its investment in the belgium facility is recoverable 
however  if the estimated revenue growth is not achieved  the carrying amount of the facility is likely to be impaired 
as discussed above  on january   sbc announced that it would buy at t corp  and announced its intention to migrate the services provided by network to the at t network 
since sbc is wiltel s and network s largest customer  accounting for of network s revenues  the company concluded that the sbc announcement is an event which requires the company to assess the carrying value of wiltel s long lived assets for impairment  principally property and equipment 
since the event which gave rise to the impairment review occurred on january   and is not reflective of a condition that existed as of december   the assessment of impairment will be performed as part of the preparation of the company s financial statements for the first quarter of  and does not effect the carrying amount of the company s assets as of december  the carrying value of wiltel s property and equipment is approximately  at december  the company will have to make numerous assumptions and estimates about the future to prepare its impairment analysis 
the process of estimating future cash flows is subjective and inherently inaccurate because precise information about the future is not available  and in this case is exacerbated by the volatility that the telecommunications industry has experienced over the past few years 
the economics of wiltel s future relationship with sbc  including its term  is also uncertain  which will be one of the most significant variables in the analysis 
wiltel is currently engaged in negotiations with sbc concerning this and other pricing matters 
wiltel will also have to make assumptions concerning its ability to retain existing customers  attract new customers  reduce expenses and participate in potential consolidation opportunities as part of the analysis 
the company is not currently able to determine whether the carrying amounts of wiltel s long lived assets are impaired 
acquisition of wiltel in connection with accounting for the acquisition of wiltel  significant judgments and estimates were made to determine the fair values of certain liabilities  including liabilities for net unfavorable long term commitments and deferred revenue  many of which required the company to make assumptions about the future 
to determine the fair value of deferred revenue  the company had to assess transactions having limited activity in the current telecommunications market environment 
the company considered market indicators related to pricing  pricing for comparable transactions  as well as the legal obligation of wiltel to provide future services 
the company also assumed wiltel would continue to perform its contractual obligations through the term of its contracts 
revenue is recognized on these contracts as services are performed  typically on a straight line basis over the remaining length of the contract 
in the future  if wiltel settles these obligations or they are otherwise terminated prior to completion of the performance obligation  the company would likely recognize a gain equal to the carrying amount of the obligation 
at december   the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for deferred revenue was  the company evaluated the fair value of long term commitments that were either above or below the current market rates for similar transactions  and the fair value of telecommunications capacity commitments that are not required based on wiltel s current operating plans 
these commitments primarily consist of real estate leases and international capacity contracts 
in order to determine the fair values of these agreements  the company made significant assumptions concerning future market prices  future capacity utilization  the ability to enter into subleasing arrangements and that the commitments will not be terminated prior to their expiration dates 
the accrued liability is amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the commitments 
results of operations in the future would be impacted by any subsequent adjustment to this liability  which could result from negotiating a termination or reduction of its contractual obligation with contract counter parties or sublease activity that is different from the company s original assumptions 
at december   the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for unfavorable long term commitments was  telecommunications revenue recognition capacity  transmission  video services and other telecommunications services revenues are recognized monthly as the services are provided or revenues are earned 
if at the time services are rendered  collection is not reasonably assured either due to credit risk  the potential for billing disputes or other reasons  revenue is not recognized until such contingencies are resolved 
wiltel estimates the amount of services which should not be recognized as revenue at the time the service is rendered based on its collection experience for each type of service 
certain of wiltel s customers represent such a high credit risk due to their difficult financial position that revenue is not recognized until cash is received 
in addition  wiltel knows from past experience that a certain percentage of its billings will be disputed and uses that experience to estimate the amount of expected disputes and defers recognition of revenue at the time the service is provided 
revenues that have not been recognized at the time service is provided are subsequently recognized as revenue when the amounts are collected 
accruals for access costs wiltel s access costs primarily include variable charges paid to vendors to originate and or terminate switched voice traffic  which are based on actual usage at negotiated or regulated contract rates  and fixed charges for leased lines for dedicated facilities 
at the end of each reporting period  wiltel s estimated accrual for incurred but not yet billed costs is based on internal usage reports 
the accrual is subsequently reconciled to actual invoices as they are received  which is a process that can take several months to complete 
this process includes an invoice validation procedure that normally identifies errors and inaccuracies in rate and or volume components of the invoices resulting in numerous invoice disputes 
it is wiltel s policy to adjust the accrual for the probable amount it believes will ultimately be paid on disputed invoices  a determination which requires significant estimation and judgment 
due to the number of different negotiated and regulated rates  constantly changing traffic patterns  uncertainty in the ultimate resolution of disputes  the period of time required to complete the reconciliation and delays in invoicing by access vendors  changes in these estimates should be expected 
contingencies the company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet includes litigation reserves of  all of which relate to wiltel litigation 
estimating the ultimate outcome of litigation matters is inherently uncertain  in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the company to control 
the company does not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations or liquidity 
however  if the amounts ultimately paid at the resolution of a litigation matter are significantly different than the company s recorded reserve amount  the difference could be material to the company s consolidated results of operations and  with respect to wiltel  settlement amounts are likely to be material to its liquidity 
results of operations telecommunications the following table reconciles wiltel s segment profit from operations to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december  and for the period from november  when wiltel became a consolidated subsidiary through december  prior to november   the company accounted for its share of wiltel s results under the equity method of accounting 
audited financial statements of wiltel for the period from january  to november  are filed as financial statement schedules to this report 
for wiltel s segments  segment profit from operations is the primary performance measure of segment operating results and profitability 
wiltel defines segment profit from operations as income before income taxes  interest expense  investment income  depreciation and amortization expense and other non operating income and expense 
for the year november  ended december  through december  network vyvx total wiltel network vyvx total wiltel in thousands operating revenues       segment profit from operations       depreciation and amortization expense       interest expense  net of investment income      other non operating income  net      pre tax income loss       excludes intersegment revenues from amounts billed by network to vyvx of  and  respectively  for and for the period 
if items in these categories can not be directly attributed to a particular wiltel segment  they are allocated to each segment based upon a formula that considers each segment s revenues  property and equipment and headcount 
network s revenues include services provided to sbc of  and  for the and periods  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of network s operating revenues 
network s revenues from sbc have continued to grow throughout and  principally related to voice products  for which sbc and wiltel have agreed to use a fixed price through april  the growth in voice revenue resulted from  in part  sbc s continued growth in long distance services in various states  including california  michigan  indiana  ohio  illinois and wisconsin 
revenues attributable to other rbocs were approximately and of network s operating revenues for the and periods  respectively 
revenues and gross margins for non sbc related business continue to reflect the excess telecommunications capacity in the marketplace  which has resulted in lower prices for wiltel and others in the industry  and created a very competitive environment for acquiring new business 
in  wiltel s network segment began to sell into the enterprise business market  although revenues have not been material to date 
as discussed above  sbc s announcement to migrate its business from network to the at t network is expected to have a significant impact on wiltel s future revenues and profitability 
sbc indicated that it expects to close its acquisition of at t in the first half of wiltel expects it will take anywhere from two to three years from now for sbc to migrate all of its traffic off of wiltel s network  and anticipates that it will continue to provide some level of service to sbc into wiltel expects it will evaluate and implement cost reduction strategies  investigate sales of assets and minimize capital expenditure outlays to help offset the loss of sbc s business 
however  given the current economic condition of the telecommunications industry as a whole  where telecommunications capacity far exceeds actual demand and the marketplace is characterized by fierce price competition  and the limited growth of non sbc business over the past few years  wiltel does not believe it will be able to fully replace the revenues and profits generated by the sbc agreements in the near future  if ever 
network s cost of sales has increased in line with revenue growth throughout and  and is comprised of variable charges paid to access vendors to originate and or terminate switched voice traffic  and fixed charges for leased facilities and local off net costs 
the price network pays for these services has been declining  generally in line with declines experienced by network in its pricing of its own services to customers 
network s gross margin percentage has been adversely affected by a larger mix of voice transport business  principally resulting from sbc s growth  which has a lower gross margin as compared to some of network s other products and services 
in addition  network cost of sales in includes a charge of  for international voice access costs  for which no revenue was recognized 
wiltel entered into a commitment for these access costs in order to provide services for a specific customer  however  the customer defaulted under its contract  and wiltel accrued the remaining amount of the commitment  but does not expect to be able to recover from its customer 
network s salaries were  and  for the and periods  respectively  and selling  general and other expenses were  and  for the and periods  respectively 
selling  general and other expenses in include a reduction of  to the provision for doubtful accounts  principally due to the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable which had been in dispute 
the provision for doubtful accounts also includes a charge of  to fully reserve for another customer s accounts receivable which is not expected to be collected 
selling  general and other expenses in include  for estimated repair costs for wiltel s headquarters building 
the need for repair work arose after the building was damaged in a severe storm 
while insurance recovery is deemed probable for some repairs to the building  the accrual relates to repairs for which insurance recovery is not assured  as they are necessitated by underlying design flaws in the building 
wiltel will seek to obtain reimbursement from the responsible parties  however  no recovery has been accrued 
network s salaries expense and selling  general and other expenses for reflect lower headcount  higher costs of performance based compensation  greater personnel retention costs and greater vendor contract maintenance costs for the network 
vyvx operating revenues were  and  for the and periods  respectively 
revenues in were slightly lower due in part to fewer hockey game broadcasts due to the national hockey league labor dispute and customers switching to lower cost vyvx products 
although the lower priced products result in less revenue  the costs to provide these products and related selling  general and other expenses is also lower  which results in increased segment profits

since its acquisition in september  symphony has been focused on profitably growing its business and  because of the nature of its business  attracting and hiring skilled professionals to provide its services 
the ability of symphony to continue to grow its business depends heavily upon its ability to attract  develop and retain qualified therapists 
there is a current shortage of qualified therapists industry wide  and symphony has open positions to provide service to new customers  provide additional service offerings for existing customers and through normal employee turnover 
the tight labor market causes symphony and others in its industry to hire  at times  independent contractors to perform required services  which may increase costs and reduce margins  and can also result in lost revenue opportunities 
during  symphony performed an evaluation of its customer base  in order to identify those customers and markets where symphony can deliver the highest level of service and that should be the focus of customer retention efforts  as well as identifying those customers that should be terminated 
in addition  symphony has restructured its corporate management and field operations organization  resulting in a more efficient organization with reduced costs 
symphony is also seeking to grow its profitable businesses  which includes expanding its service offerings to existing customers 
symphony may look for strategic acquisitions to increase its customer base and pool of professional service providers  however  no assurance can be given that it will be successful in those efforts 
legislative caps on part b medicare therapy  which negatively impacted symphony s revenues in  have been removed for and  and the fee schedule for such services has also been increased by 
as a result  symphony s average quarterly revenues for these therapy services increased by approximately as compared to the fourth quarter of  comparing only those locations that were operating during all periods 
symphony also added new customers during  however  certain low margin and non profitable accounts were cancelled  resulting in a slight decrease in total locations serviced 
during  one customer accounted for approximately of symphony s revenues 
symphony s margins for also reflect higher hourly wages and benefits paid to attract and retain its therapists  and increased costs to hire independent contractors as a result of hiring needs for both full time and part time professionals

the moratorium on legislative caps for part b medicare therapy is scheduled to expire on december  while there is some congressional support for an extension of the moratorium  there is also concern regarding the cost of an extension 
symphony is unable to predict what the ultimate outcome will be  however  any re introduction of the legislative caps or other methodology that reduces fees for part b medicare therapy could significantly reduce symphony s revenues 
manufacturing pre tax income for the manufacturing segment was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
manufacturing revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues increased by in and by in  while they declined by in as compared to the prior year 
manufacturing revenues in increased in substantially all of the division s markets 
the company believes that these increases result from a variety of factors including an improved economy  new product development and the acquisition in the first quarter of of customer receivables and inventory of a competitor that was exiting certain markets 
although raw material costs increased significantly in  the division increased selling prices in most markets  that along with increased sales and production volumes enabled it to maintain its gross profit margins 
the primary raw material in the division s products is a polypropylene resin  which is a byproduct of the oil refining process  whose price tends to increase and decrease with the price of oil 
there is relatively little direct labor or other raw material costs in the division s products 
in addition to managing resin purchases  the division also has initiatives to reduce and or reuse scrap thereby increasing raw material utilization 
as a result  the division s gross profit and gross profit margins increased in as compared to pre tax results for also reflect greater salaries expense  due to higher bonuses attributable to the division s improved performance 
during  the division will seek to gain additional cost efficiencies resulting from its acquisition of nsw  principally in administration and overhead expense and raw material purchasing

the increase in manufacturing revenues in primarily resulted from increases in the construction and consumer products markets of  although revenues in the carpet padding and agricultural markets declined 
however  gross profit declined  as the increase in the price of resin more than offset the revenue increase

in addition  the impairment charge that is discussed below reduced pre tax results in for the year ended december   the division recorded an impairment charge of approximately  to write down the book value of certain production lines that the division did not expect would be utilized over the next several years 
these lines were initially purchased to provide additional capacity to produce a specific product for a specific customer  however  the customer discontinued the product in and the company determined that the cost of these lines were no longer recoverable from other business 
banking and lending as stated previously  the current activities of the banking and lending segment are concentrated on collecting and servicing its remaining loan portfolio  maximizing returns on its investment portfolio and discharging deposit liabilities as they come due 
as a result  revenues and expenses for this segment included in the company s consolidated statements of operations are reflective of the continuing decrease in the size of the loan portfolio 
in addition  as described earlier in this report  during  the company sold its subprime automobile and collateralized consumer loan portfolios representing approximately of its total outstanding loans net of unearned finance charges and certain loan portfolios that had been substantially written off for aggregate pre tax gains of  which is reflected in investment and other income 
pre tax income for the banking and lending segment was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
finance revenues  which reflect both the level and mix of consumer instalment loans  decreased in each of the last two years as compared to the prior period  as average loans outstanding were   and  during  and  respectively 
although finance revenues decreased in as compared to  pre tax results increased due to gains from the loan portfolios sales  a decline in the provision for loan losses of  reductions in interest expense of  principally resulting from reduced customer banking deposits  less interest paid on interest rate swaps and lower salaries expense and operating costs resulting from the segment s restructuring efforts 
all of these changes reflect the ongoing reduction in the amount of loan assets under management  including as a result of the loan portfolios sales 
although finance revenues decreased in as compared to for the reasons described above  pre tax results increased primarily due to a  reduction in interest expense  due to reduced customer banking deposits and lower interest rates thereon  a decline in the provision for loan losses of  less interest paid on interest rate swaps and lower salaries expense and operating costs resulting from the segment s restructuring efforts 
the reduction in the provision for bad debts resulted from the decrease in the size of the consumer loan portfolios 
however  the company increased its allowance during the third quarter of by  as a result of an increase in delinquency  which shortly followed the outsourcing of loan collection activities 
pre tax results for the banking and lending segment include income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulting from mark to market changes on its interest rate swaps 
the company used interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its customer banking deposits  all of the segment s interest rate swaps matured in although the company believes that these derivative financial instruments served as economic hedges  they did not meet certain effectiveness criteria under sfas and  therefore  were not accounted for as hedges 
domestic real estate pre tax income for the domestic real estate segment was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pre tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment s operating properties  the current status of the company s real estate development projects and non recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold 
as a result  the results of operations for this segment in the aggregate for any particular year are not predictable and do not follow any consistent pattern 
revenues and pre tax results for this segment increased in as compared to  primarily due to the sale of lots at the company s lot development project in south walton county  florida for aggregate sales proceeds of approximately  for which the company recognized pre tax profits of  net of minority interest 
the company will be required under the sale agreements to make significant improvements to the property  including infrastructure and certain amenities  which it expects to complete in the company estimates it will recognize additional pre tax profit of  related to this project

available corporate cash is generally invested on a short term basis until such time as investment opportunities require an expenditure of funds 
investment and other income for included  of income related to a refund of foreign taxes not based on income 
investment and other income declined in as compared to  principally as a result of a non recurring gain of  recognized in from the sale of the company s thoroughbred racetrack business 
corporate investment income also declined as a result of lower interest rates in and foreign exchange gains recorded in during  income related to accounting for the market values of corporate s derivative financial instruments increased by  and the company also recorded  of income related to a refund of foreign taxes not based on income 
in addition  revenues from the company s gas operations increased in principally due to increased production and prices 
net securities gains losses for corporate and other operations aggregated   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  substantially all of the company s net securities gains reflect realized gains from the sale of publicly traded debt and equity securities that had been classified as corporate available for sale securities 
net securities gains losses for  and include provisions of   and  respectively  to write down the company s investments in certain available for sale securities and an investment in a non public security in and an equity investment in a non public fund in the write down of the securities resulted from a decline in market value determined to be other than temporary 
the company s decision to sell securities and realize security gains or losses is generally based on its evaluation of an individual security s value at the time and the prospect for changes in its value in the future 
the decision can also be influenced by the status of the company s tax attributes but in recent years has not been influenced by liquidity needs 
therefore  the timing of realized security gains or losses is not predictable and does not follow any pattern from year to year 
the increase in interest expense during as compared to primarily reflects interest expense relating to the  aggregate principal amount of the senior notes issued during and  the issuance of  principal amount of its convertible senior subordinated notes in and dividends accrued on its trust issued preferred securities  which commencing july  are classified as interest expense shown as minority interest in prior periods as a result of the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
the increase in interest expense during as compared to principally results from the issuance of  aggregate principal amount of the senior notes that were issued in and dividends accrued on its trust issued preferred securities 
the increase in selling  general and other expenses of  in as compared to primarily reflects greater professional and other fees of  which largely relate to due diligence expenses for potential investments  greater professional fees for existing investments and fees relating to the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of  and  of expenses related to the proposed public offering of mk resources equity that did not go forward due to unfavorable market conditions 
in addition  the increase reflects greater employee benefit expenses  higher insurance costs and greater amortization of debt issuance costs related to the senior notes and convertible notes 
selling  general and other expenses also include additions to cost of goods sold of the winery operations of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the winery operations  which account for inventory under the lifo method of accounting  recorded adjustments to cost of goods sold based upon the results of its annual harvest 
the additional expenses recorded in each of the last three years were due primarily to a lower yield than had been previously estimated 
the income tax provision reflects the reversal of tax reserves aggregating   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  as a result of the favorable resolution of various state and federal income tax contingencies 
in addition  in the tax provision reflects a benefit to record a federal income tax carryback refund of  in  the company established a valuation allowance that fully reserved for all of wiltel s net deferred tax assets  reduced by an amount equal to the company s current and deferred federal income tax liabilities as of the date of acquisition 
the company needs the valuation allowance because  on a pro forma combined basis  the company is not able to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize the deferred tax asset 
subsequent to the acquisition of wiltel  any benefit realized from wiltel s deferred tax asset reduces the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset  however  that reduction is first applied to reduce the carrying amount of the acquired non current intangible assets of wiltel rather than reduce the income tax provision of any component of total comprehensive income 
as a result  the various components of comprehensive income include an aggregate federal income tax provision of  in and  in for the period subsequent to the acquisition of wiltel  even though no federal income tax for those periods was due 
during  the effect of recording this tax provision and the resulting reduction to the valuation allowance was to reduce the carrying amount of the acquired non current intangible assets to zero 
income tax expense for also includes the company s actual income tax expense for the period prior to the acquisition of wiltel 
now that the non current intangible assets have been reduced to zero  the company does not expect it will reflect a net federal income tax expense or benefit for total comprehensive income in the aggregate until such time as the company is able to reduce its valuation allowance and recognize a net deferred tax asset 
each component of other comprehensive income may reflect either a federal income tax provision or benefit in future periods  depending upon the relative amounts of each component  however  in the aggregate for all components the company does not expect to report any net federal income tax expense or benefit for the foreseeable future
