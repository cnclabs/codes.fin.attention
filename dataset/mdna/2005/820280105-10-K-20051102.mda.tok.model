item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
the following analysis contains forward looking statements about our future revenues  operating results and expectations 
see forward looking statements and associated risks for a discussion of the risks  assumptions and uncertainties affecting these statements as well as risk factors 
critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments and estimates  or involve uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
engineering  procurement and construction contract and environmental and infrastructure revenue recognition and profit and loss estimates including claims a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
the contracts may be performed as stand alone engineering  procurement or construction contracts or as combined contracts ie one contract that covers engineering  procurement and construction or a combination thereof 
we use accounting principles set forth in american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and other applicable accounting standards to account for our contracts 
we recognize revenues for these contracts on the percentage of completion method  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
performance incentives are included in our estimates of revenues using the percentage of completion method when their realization is reasonably assured 
cancellation fees are recognized when received 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which the losses are identified 
the cumulative effect of changes to estimated contract profit and loss  including those arising from contract penalty provisions such as liquidated damages  final contract settlements  warranty claims and reviews of our costs performed by customers  are recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  we report such a change by recognizing a charge against current earnings  which might be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
the costs attributable to change orders and claims being negotiated or disputed with customers  vendors or subcontractors or subject to litigation are included in our estimates of revenues when it is probable they will result in additional contract revenues and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
profit from such change orders and claims is recorded in the period 
table of contents such amounts are settled or approved 
backcharges and claims against and from our vendors  subcontractors and others are included in our cost estimates as a reduction or increase in total estimated costs when recovery or payment of the amounts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible there will be future and currently unforeseeable significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and gross profit for contracts currently in process  particularly in the later stages of the contracts 
these adjustments are common in the construction industry and inherent in the nature of our contracts 
these adjustments could  depending on the magnitude of the adjustments and or the number of contracts being completed  materially  positively or negatively  affect our operating results in an annual or quarterly reporting period 
these adjustments are  in our opinion  most likely to occur as a result of  or be affected by  the following factors in the application of the percentage of completion accounting method discussed above for our contracts 
revenues and gross profit from cost reimbursable  long term contracts can be significantly affected by contract incentives penalties that may not be known or finalized until the later stages of the contracts 
substantially all of our revenues from cost reimbursable contracts are based on costs incurred plus mark up and or fees where applicable 
applying our revenue recognition practices to these types of contracts usually results in revenues being recognized as work is performed and costs are incurred and generally results in a reasonably consistent gross profit during most of the contract term 
our cost reimbursable contracts are sometimes structured as target price contracts 
target price contracts contain an incentive penalty arrangement which results in our fee being adjusted  within certain limits  for cost under runs overruns to an established target price  representing our estimated cost and fee for the project 
in addition  certain target price contracts require that we share in cost overruns in excess of our fee which would result in a loss on the contract should such a level of cost overruns occur 
cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of all of our costs  but generally limit our fee to a fixed percentage of costs or to a certain specified amount and often specify costs that are not reimbursable 
usually  target price contracts are priced with higher fees than cost reimbursable contracts because of the uncertainties relating to an adjustable fee arrangement or for the sharing of potential cost overruns in excess of the fee 
additionally  both the target cost and cost reimbursable contracts frequently have other incentive and penalty provisions for such matters as schedule  testing and performance results 
generally  the penalty provisions for our cost reimbursable contracts are capped to limit our monetary exposure 
although we believe it is unlikely that we could incur losses or lose all of our gross profit on our cost reimbursable contracts  it is possible for penalties to reduce or eliminate previously recorded profits 
the incentive penalty provisions are usually finalized as contract change orders either subsequent to negotiation with  or verification by  our customers 
therefore  while cost reimbursable contracts generally limit our risks on the related projects  we can and do incur losses on these contracts 
in most situations  the amount and impact of incentives penalties are not  or cannot be  finalized until the completion stages of the contract  at which time we will record the adjustment amounts on a cumulative  catch up basis 
we have a number of fixed price contracts  for which the accuracy of gross profit is dependent on the accuracy of cost estimates and other factors 
the accuracy of the gross profit we report for fixed price contracts is dependent upon the judgments we make with respect to our contract performance  our cost estimates  and our ability to recover additional contract costs through change orders  claims or backcharges to the customer  subcontractors and vendors 
many of these contracts also have incentive penalty provisions 
increases in cost estimates  unless recoverable from claims or change orders  will result in a reduction in profit equivalent to the cost increase 
disputes with other parties involved in the contract can and often do occur  which we refer to as claims 
these disputes are generally the result of one party incurring costs or damages caused by another party during execution of the project 
we may incur additional costs or be damaged and we may cause additional costs or damage other parties 
the other parties include our customer on the contract  subcontractors and vendors we have contracted with to execute portions of the project and others 
we may claim damages against others and others may claim damages against us 
collectively  we refer to disputes related to collection of these damages as claims 
claims include amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from our customers for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
these claims against customers are included in our revenue estimates as additional contract revenues to the extent that contract costs have been incurred when the recovery of such amounts is probable 
backcharges and claims against and from our vendors  subcontractors and others are included in our cost estimates as a reduction or increase in total estimated costs when recovery or payment of the amounts is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents revenues and gross profit on contracts can be significantly affected by change orders and claims that may not be ultimately negotiated until the later stages of a contract or subsequent to the date a contract is completed 
when estimating the amount of total gross profit or loss on a contract  we include claims related to our customers as adjustments to revenues and claims related to vendors  subcontractors and others as adjustments to cost of revenues when the collection is deemed probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
including claims in this calculation ultimately increases the gross profit or reduces the loss that would otherwise be recorded without consideration of the claims 
our claims against others are recorded to the extent of costs incurred and include no profit until such time as they are finalized and approved 
in most cases  the claims included in determining contract gross profit are less than the actual claim that will be or has been presented 
claims are included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on the balance sheet see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant claims 
other revenue recognition and profit and loss estimates revenue is recognized from consulting services as the work is performed 
consulting services work is primarily performed on a cost reimbursable basis 
revenues related to royalty use of our performance enhancements derived from our chemical technologies are recorded in the period earned based on the performance criteria defined in the related contracts 
for running royalty agreements  we recognize revenues based on customer production volumes at the contract specified unit rates 
sales of paid up license agreements are coupled with the sale of engineering services for the integration of the technology into the customers processes 
for paid up license agreements  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method  measured primarily by the percentage of costs incurred to date on engineering services to total estimated engineering costs 
under such agreements  revenue available for recognition on a percent complete basis is limited to the agreement value less a liability provision for contractually specified process performance guarantees 
the liability provision is recorded in gross profit when  and if  the related performance testing is successfully completed 
we recognize revenues for pipe fittings  manufacturing operations and other services at the time of shipment or as services are performed 
for unit priced pipe fabrication contracts  we recognize revenues upon completion of individual spools of production 
a spool consists of piping materials and associated shop labor to form a prefabricated unit according to contract specifications 
spools are generally shipped to job site locations when complete 
during the fabrication process  all direct and indirect costs related to the fabrication process are capitalized as work in progress 
for fixed price fabrication contracts  we recognize revenues based on the percentage of completion method  measured primarily by the cost of materials for which production is complete to the total estimated material costs of the contract 
for most housing privatization projects we provide operations management  development  and construction services through owned entities the privatization subsidiaries 
these services are provided to the companies that hold the equity ownership in the housing and related assets the privatization entities 
typically  the privatization subsidiary and the related military branch each own a portion of the privatization entity during the term of contract  which generally is years 
the privatization subsidiary recognizes revenues from operations management and related incentive fees as earned 
the privatization subsidiary recognizes revenues on development and construction service fees on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
we defer our economic ownership percentage of development and construction service fees and recognize those fees over the useful lives of the related capitalized improvements 
we recognize earnings for our economic ownership percentage of the net earnings of the privatization entity 
because the privatization subsidiaries are unconsolidated subsidiaries  we record their results in earnings from unconsolidated entities see note of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses that could result from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
we record to expense additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s assessment of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  and the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the specific customer reduces the recognized receivable to the net amount we believe will be ultimately collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  further additions to the 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts  which would reduce our earnings  may be required 
these increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts could be significant  depending upon the size of certain of our epc contracts and the potential for us to perform a substantial amount of unreimbursed work on significant projects prior to customers notifying us of their intent not to pay the amounts due 
past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amounts due see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets liabilities are established for the difference between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and other tax credits 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we also consider the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment of such realization 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
as of august   we had gross deferred tax assets of million  net of valuation allowance including million related to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
as of august   we had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million see note of our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions fair value accounting and goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of their identifiable net assets 
our goodwill balance as of august  was approximately million  most of which related to the stone webster acquisition in fiscal and the it group acquisition in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we completed our annual impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined that goodwill at march  was not impaired 
we test goodwill for impairment at each of our reporting unit levels 
in evaluating whether an impairment of goodwill exists  we calculate the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units based on estimated projected discounted cash flows as of the date we perform the impairment tests implied fair value 
we then compare the resulting estimated implied fair values  by reporting unit  to the respective book values  including goodwill 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value which is a reasonable estimate of the value of goodwill for the purpose of measuring an impairment loss of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss on the goodwill at that time 
in evaluating whether there was an impairment of goodwill  we also take into consideration changes in our business and changes in our projected discounted cash flows  in addition to our stock price and market value of interest bearing obligations 
we do not believe any events have occurred since our annual impairment test that would cause an impairment of goodwill 
however  our businesses are cyclical and subject to competitive pressures 
therefore  it is possible that the goodwill values of our businesses could be adversely impacted in the future by these or other factors and that a significant impairment adjustment  which would reduce earnings and affect various debt covenants  could be required in such circumstances 
our next required annual impairment test will be conducted in the third quarter of fiscal unless indicators of impairment occur prior to that time 
our estimates of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities we acquire in acquisitions are determined by reference to various internal and external data and judgments  including the use of third party experts 
these estimates can and do differ from the basis or value generally representing the acquired entity s actual or amortized cost previously recorded by the acquired entity for its assets and liabilities 
accordingly  our post acquisition financial statements are materially impacted by and dependent on the accuracy of management s fair value estimates and adjustments 
our experience has been that the most significant of these estimates are the values assigned to construction contracts  production backlog  customer relationships  licenses and technology 
these estimates can also have a positive or negative material effect on future reported operating results 
further  our future operating results may also be positively or negatively materially impacted if the final values for the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in our acquisitions are materially different from the fair value estimates which we recorded for the acquisition 
long lived assets we periodically assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our long lived assets including intangible assets  including licenses  patents  technology and related processes  based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and 
table of contents their contribution to our overall operations 
should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the other intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss 
litigation  commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims  lawsuits  environmental matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based on professional knowledge and experience of our management and legal counsel 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts 
in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used  such as the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on investments  or future salary costs  our future pension benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
as of august   we had a minimum pension liability recorded of million 
this liability will likely require us to increase our future cash contributions to the plans 
general effective september   we segregated our business activities into four operating segments e c  maintenance  e i  and f m 
the primary change from our previously reported segments is the division of our former engineering  construction maintenance ecm segment into the newly created e c segment and maintenance segment 
environmental infrastructure the e i segment provides services which include the identification of contaminants in soil  air and water and the subsequent design and execution of remedial solutions 
this segment also provides project and facilities management and other related services to non environmental construction  watershed restoration and outsourcing privatization markets 
on june   we sold roche ltd  consulting group  which offered services of studies and consultation  engineering construction and project management in eastern canada 
the results of operations for this business are classified as discontinued operations in the statements of operations for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal energy chemicals the e c segment provides a range of project related services  including design  engineering  construction  procurement  technology and consulting services  primarily to the energy and chemical industries 
maintenance the maintenance segment performs routine and outage turnaround maintenance services  including restorative  repair  renovation  modification  predictive and preventative maintenance services  to customers in their facilities worldwide primarily in the energy  including nuclear  and chemical industries 
fabrication  manufacturing and distribution the f m segment provides integrated piping systems and services for new construction  site expansion and retrofit projects for industrial plants 
on august   we sold our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses 
these businesses designed  engineered and fabricated pipe hangers  mechanical scrubbers  and specialty stainless  alloy and carbon steel pipe fittings 
the results of operations for the hanger engineering and pipe support businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the statements of operations for the years ended august  and 
table of contents our business a substantial portion of our revenues and profit  particularly for our e c and e i segments  is derived from engineering  procurement and construction epc projects 
some of these projects may span several years from start to finish 
we recognize revenues and profit for many of these contracts on the percentage of completion method which requires estimates of the total revenues and total costs at completion as well as the progress towards completion 
adjustments to such results can and do occur when identified 
when these adjustments are identified near or at the end of a project  the full impact of the change in estimate would be recognized as a change in the profit on the contract in that period 
this can result in a material impact on our results for a single reporting period 
therefore  our discussion of results for each of our segments often includes discussion of significant changes in major projects and their impact on our results 
comments regarding future operations historically  we have used acquisitions to pursue market opportunities and to augment or increase existing capabilities and plan to continue to do so 
however  all comments concerning our expectations for future revenues and operating results are based on our forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions 
results of operations effective september   we segregated our business activities into four operating segments new operating segments e c  maintenance  e i  and f m 
the primary change from our previously reported segments is the division of our former engineering  construction maintenance ecm segment into the newly created e c segment and maintenance segment 
we have also redefined our power generation industry to be energy and our process industry to be chemicals 
in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and relation information  we have restated fiscal results based on the new operating segments 
however  due to the impracticality of restating all of the fiscal results because of the way the business was managed during fiscal  we have only restated the revenues for fiscal based on the new operating segments 
thus  the comments and tables that follow compare revenues  gross profit loss  gross profit loss percentages and backlog by operating segment for years ended august   and based on the following comparisons fiscal versus fiscal based on new operating segments and on former ecm operating segment excluding revenues fiscal versus fiscal  based on new operating segments except e c maintenance  which revenues only is presented and on former ecm operating segment excluding revenues we have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period s presentation

backlog awards are evaluated by management  on a project by project basis  and are reported for each period shown based upon the binding nature of the underlying contract  commitment or letter of intent  and other factors  including the economic  financial and regulatory viability of the project and the likelihood of the contract being cancelled 
fiscal compared to fiscal executive summary increased activity in the energy and chemical markets  consistent demand for clean air and fuels and transmission and distribution services  garrison support services  and disaster relief and construction services in the southeast region of the united states in the first quarter of fiscal contributed to our overall revenue growth for fiscal gross profit for fiscal significantly increased compared to fiscal  which included a charge of million related to the neg projects 
excluding the neg charge  gross profit for fiscal increased by million as the result of increased construction activity in our energy and chemical projects  increased maintenance services for our energy and chemical customers  and increased profits on our manufacturing and distribution products 
however  our e i segment experienced a decrease in gross profit in fiscal due to a decline in the volume of its commercial services and of its federal project and environmental remediation services 

table of contents for fiscal  general and administrative expense were of revenues as compared to for fiscal  however there was a charge of million in fiscal related to the accelerated depreciation of certain software assets  which when factored in resulted in  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues for fiscal were relatively consistent with fiscal in addition  other income and expenses for fiscal included a loss on the retirement of debt of million and a decrease in interest expense of approximately million for fiscal resulting from the repurchase of our senior notes during the third quarter of fiscal see note of our consolidated financial statements 
our effective tax rate for fiscal also reflects a million increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance see note of our consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal and  we sold two of our non core businesses 
roche ltd  consulting group  which was part of our e i segment  was sold on june  our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses  which were included in our f m segment  were sold on august  both are presented in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
since august   our backlog has increased approximately million or 
a significant portion of the increase is due to the growth of our fossil fuel epc projects for multiple customers and chemical projects such as an ethylene plant and clean fuel projects in our e c segment 
new contracts for natural gas separation and a compression plant in our f m segment accounted for a percentage of the increase  however  there were offsetting decreases due to steady execution of existing contracts without increases in scopes of current work  a minimal amount of new contract awards in our e i segment and progress on existing contracts in our maintenance segment 
we expect revenues from our energy markets to increase and revenues from our chemicals market to increase substantially 
these end markets will drive increased revenues in our e c  maintenance and f m segments which will increase gross profit overall 
we also expect increases in revenues in our e i segment driven by hurricane recovery and restoration work and expect increases in gross profit due to the higher revenues 
finally  we expect significant improvements in net income in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher revenues and gross profit  reduced interest costs from the reduction in our outstanding debt  offset by slightly higher general and administrative costs and the inclusion of expenses related to the expensing of unvested stock options to employees  which is required to commence in fiscal segment analysis new operating segments presentation e i segment revenues the decrease of million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in commercial services due to a significant project completed in  which was not replaced in and a significant project provided significantly more volume in as compared to  fewer federal government based opportunities leading to a more competitive market for these opportunities  and our national commercial customers trending toward requesting bids on opportunities as opposed to issuing new awards under master service agreements  a decrease in federal environmental remediation and property management services due to federal budget restrictions impacting environmental opportunities  less work being awarded under existing contracts and or delays in funding under existing contracts  and a decrease in our project services supporting the us government customers in iraq due to delays in government funding combined with a competitive bid environment arising from changes in contracting vehicles to more fixed price opportunities 
these decreases in revenues were partially offset by increased garrison support and logistic support services for the u 
s 
army and revenues earned providing disaster relief and construction services to federal customers in hurricane damaged areas 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for fiscal was million or as compared to million or for fiscal 
table of contents the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage is due primarily to a decrease in commercial services  resulting from lower volume of work and recognition of contract losses on certain commercial construction projects of approximately million in fiscal  arising from project execution issues in the current fiscal year  a decrease in project services supporting the us government customers in iraq  and a decrease in federal environmental remediation services due to less work being awarded under existing contracts and delays in funding  which were offset by increased gross profit and gross profit percentage due to negotiation of restructuring costs proposed  finalization of sale lease back costs and their associated treatment  and other indirect rate negotiations  resulting in the application of revised government indirect rates to contract direct costs discussed further below  offset by increased gross profit and gross profit percentage due to a reduction in estimated costs to complete a major fixed price contract as a result of cessation of certain operations at the request of the customer which decreased our estimated project expenses as compared to the prior year for this project discussed further below  and offset by increased gross profit and gross profit percentage due to providing disaster relief and construction services to federal customers in hurricane damaged areas 
the revised government indirect rates discussed above increased fiscal gross profit by million 
this compares to a million increase in gross profit in fiscal resulting from other matters impacting indirect rates 
of the amounts recognized in fiscal and fiscal  million and million  respectively  were reductions of accruals recorded in the acquisition of the it group in fiscal by quarter  the net impact to fiscal of changes in the accruals was a net increase in gross profit of million in the fourth quarter and million in the third quarter million and million  respectively  of which resulted from reductions of accruals recorded in the acquisition of the it group in fiscal 
our e i segment recorded gross profit on a single major environmental remediation fixed price contract of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the gross profit percentage recorded on this major project was significantly higher than the gross profit percentage reflected on other major e i contracts in these periods 
this project was completed in fiscal gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal and fiscal reflect a decrease in cost of revenues of million and million  respectively  for amortization of contract adjustments related to contracts acquired in the it group acquisition  and a million decrease in cost of revenues for fiscal for the reduction of accrued contract losses related to contracts acquired in the it group acquisition 
backlog backlog for the e i segment was billion as of august  compared to billion as of august  the decrease in the e i segment backlog since august  is primarily due to steady execution of existing contracts without commensurate increases in scope of work or new contract awards 
the decrease existed in both mature and expiring contracts where new activity declined in favor of more recently executed contract vehicles 
we experienced fewer proposal opportunities in the e i federal and commercial sectors and a trend toward a more selective bid proposal process in the international and commercial sectors and a trend toward highly selective bidding on lower profit multiple award construction contracts 
also  delays in funding for new government projects and a trend toward longer term development phases where contract opportunities do arise  combined with being in a more competitive industry environment are factors driving the reduction in new contract awards 
finally  the opportunities associated with fiscal awards for services to us government customers in iraq have been considerably lower than anticipated throughout fiscal as of august   the current contract backlog reflects expectations for fewer international requests for proposals  expectations for fewer contract opportunities with terms we would pursue and the removal of backlog associated with roche limited  consulting group  which was sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal subsequent to august   in the aftermath of hurricane katrina  e i has received awards under contracts with fema and the us army  and has expanded capacity on the army corps of engineers disaster relief blue roof contract  to provide a full range of services supporting hurricane clean up and recovery efforts 
there is no significant revenue in our backlog estimates for the contracting activity that occurred as a result of hurricane katrina 
we anticipate fiscal revenues to be substantially higher than in fiscal as a result of the contracts and other surfacing market opportunities emanating from participation in hurricane katrina clean up and recovery efforts  coupled with continuing new and ongoing environmental and infrastructure project activities domestically as well as internationally 
these additional revenues are expected to result in higher gross profit  however  the e i gross profit percentage is expected to remain constant  but could be different from our expectations due to governing contract terms  changes in the mix of work and the competitive environment in this industry sector 

table of contents e c segment revenues the increase of million or in segment revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal is due to several factors including increased activity on major energy projects  clean fuels projects and projects related to clean air act regulations  the inclusion of a full year of results of shaw eds operations  which was acquired in january  the fiscal charge on the covert and harquahala projects  which lowered revenues and gross profit  which was partially offset by the scheduled completion of the ethylene plant in china and the sale of pti in december gross profit and gross profit percentages the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal compared to fiscal is due to increased project activity and profitability on major energy projects 
the first quarter of the fiscal period reflects the loss recorded on the covert and harquahala epc energy projects 
increases in gross profit were partially offset by the scheduled completion of the ethylene plant in china in spring  the sale of pti in december and an impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the pike equipment that had been received in settlement of claims during fiscal see note and note of our consolidated financial statements 
our gross profit for was positively impacted by million reduction of accruals recorded in the acquisition of stone webster due to favorable progress on a dispute with our customer on a major epc project that was substantially completed prior to fiscal the positive impact of this event was offset by negative adjustments in of approximately million to amounts expected to be recovered on our claims on major projects 
as major projects are completed and their project costs finalized  the e c segment s profits have been  and we expect will continue to be  positively or negatively impacted by contract completion negotiations with customers  subcontractors and vendors on such projects as well as the outcome of litigation and settlement discussions 
gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal and fiscal reflect an increase decrease in cost of revenues of million and million  respectively  for amortization of contract adjustments related to contracts acquired in the fiscal stone webster acquisition  and million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively for the recognition of accrued losses related to contracts acquired in the stone webster acquisition 
backlog e c segment s backlog has increased million from august  due to growth in both our fossil fuel epc and our chemical backlog 
the fossil fuel backlog increased substantially due to awards relating to flue gas desulphurization fgd for multiple customers  and a megawatt coal unit designed to use circulating fluidized bed technology 
chemical backlog increased primarily as a result of a letter of intent for an ethylene plant in saudi arabia  and clean fuel projects in north america 
this was offset by the result of scheduled progress on major gas fired energy epc projects in new york and utah and completion of two chemical projects including the ethylene plant in china 
throughout fiscal we experienced strong proposal activity in both the energy and chemical sectors 
the strong proposal activity is consistent with the strong demand for fgd and coal energy capacity in the energy sector and ethylene capacity in the chemicals sector 
a considerable amount of the energy sector growth is expected to be in north america while the ethylene growth will be almost exclusively outside of north america 
we believe we are well positioned both in terms of experience and customer base to capitalize on the growth areas of the current market and anticipate that our backlog will continue to remain at historically high levels in fiscal year we also anticipate that costs associated with damage sustained by hurricanes katrina and rita on one of our epc projects in south louisiana will be recoverable from our customer under the provisions of the contract and that these costs will not have a material effect on our financial statements for fiscal 
table of contents we expect revenues to continue to increase in our energy business  primarily in fgd and coal epc services  and our transmission line and plant services business 
revenues generated from gas fired power plant epc projects are expected to decline due to the scheduled completion of our major epc projects in that business 
our chemical business is expected to increase significantly due to ethylene and clean fuels projects 
in association with these excepted revenue increases  we anticipate that gross profit percentage will slightly decline de to the shifting mix of project activity 
maintenance segment revenues the increase of million or during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to increase in activity and additional scope associated with the tva nuclear restart project  increase in maintenance services for several clients in the energy and chemical industries  and the award of a new nuclear decommissioning project  offset by decreasing activity at our uk subsidiary 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for fiscal was million or compared to million or for fiscal the increase in gross profit was due primarily to increase in maintenance services discussed above  and a decrease in losses in our uk operations resulting from efforts to make those operations smaller  more productive and efficient 
the increase in gross profit during fiscal was partially offset by our agreement to perform additional tasks related to the tva nuclear restart project that were previously not included in our scope of work 
these additional tasks increased the contract value for the project by approximately and added gross profit to our original project estimate 
due to the increase in the scope of the work on the project  our calculated percentage of completion at november  decreased as compared to the percentage of completion calculated as of august   which resulted in the temporary reversal of performance incentive revenues and gross profit in the first quarter of our fiscal that were previously recognized 
on the tva nuclear restart project  we record material performance incentives based primarily on schedule and cost savings on the project that will be ultimately determined and paid at the completion of the project which we anticipate will occur in fiscal we record the estimated amount of performance incentives that we expect to be paid in revenue and unbilled receivables on the percentage of completion method of accounting based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total project costs at completion of the project 
due to the increase in the scope of work on the project  the incentive revenues are being recognized over larger estimated total project costs at completion  which is lowering the gross profit percentage on the project as compared with the prior year 
however  the performance incentive revenues and gross profit amount reversed will be recognized as costs are incurred over the remaining contract term 
additionally  in conjunction with the increase in our scope of work  we reduced our estimate of the total performance incentives expected to be earned on the project resulting in a reversal of revenues and gross profit previously recognized 
although these reversals were offset by progress in percentage of completion achieved during the period  we recognized a net reduction in revenues and gross profit on the project of million related to the performance incentive in the first quarter of fiscal backlog backlog decreased million since august  the decrease in backlog is due to progress on existing contracts primarily offset by the additional scope of work on the tva nuclear restart project as discussed above and other project awards in the nuclear energy and chemical industries 
we believe our cross selling of maintenance services provide us with maintenance opportunities with existing customers 
additionally  we are targeting new customers in the nuclear energy industry  as well as the renewal of several current contracts in the chemical industry 

table of contents we anticipate revenues for the first quarter of fiscal to be higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal due to higher volumes of activity in the fall months when energy needs are lower than any other time during the year 
we also anticipate the gross profit percentage for the first quarter of fiscal will be higher than the same period in fiscal due to the reversal of revenues on the tva restart project discussed above 
we expect revenues and gross profit percentage to be higher in fiscal than in fiscal we also anticipate costs associated with the damage sustained by hurricane katrina on our equipment in one of our southwest louisiana fabrication facilities will be covered by insurance and that the overall loss  if any  will not be material the results of fiscal f m segment revenues the increase of million or during fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increase in fabrication revenues for the chemical industry  including chemical  petrochemical  and refinery  increase in demand for our manufactured products as a result of world wide shortages of such products  and increase in price of steel  which we are able to pass along to our customers 
segment revenues exclude intersegment revenues of million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for fiscal was million or compared to million or for fiscal the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage was due to increased gross profit being realized on the segment s manufacturing and distribution products in late fiscal and during fiscal  and intersegment revenues as they are eliminated from the f m segment consolidation while the related gross profit recognized remains with the f m segment 
the increase in gross profit percentage for fiscal includes related to these intersegment gross profit 
backlog backlog increased from million as of august  to million as of august  the increase in backlog reflects approximately million in new contracts for an oil and gas customer for natural gas separation and a compression plant in qatar 
the increase in backlog was partially offset by work performed under existing contracts during the twelve months ended august  increasing demand in the chemical industries coupled with a firming energy industry should lead to an approximately to increase in revenues in fiscal gross profit are expected to remain at or near current rates  as capacity presently exists to absorb the increased activity 
general and administrative expenses  interest income  interest expense and other income expense general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal compared with approximately million in fiscal our general and administrative expenses for fiscal included amortization expense of million related to the acceleration of amortization of certain software assets in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of a successful implementation of software systems see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the million increase during fiscal  excluding the million of amortization in fiscal  is due to an increase in the accrual of employee bonuses  an increase in costs supporting our sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives and an increase in the legal and consulting fees associated with the securities and exchange commission informal inquiry  class action litigation and contract disputes and stock based compensation expense 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses for fiscal will be slightly higher than fiscal due in part to the expensing of unvested stock options  which is required to commence in fiscal 
table of contents for fiscal  general and administrative expenses were of revenues as compared to for fiscal without the additional amortization in fiscal of million  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal interest expense was approximately million for fiscal  compared to approximately million for fiscal the decrease from the prior year reflects the decrease in our debt since fiscal  which resulted from the repurchase of our senior notes during the third quarter of fiscal see note of our consolidated financial statements 
interest income for fiscal increased to approximately million as compared to million for fiscal  primarily as a result of interest earned on a larger restricted and escrowed cash account compared to fiscal other income and expense for fiscal included a loss of million on the retirement of debt compared to million in fiscal unconsolidated entities  discontinued operations  change in exchange rates  other comprehensive income and income taxes during fiscal  we recognized earnings of million as compared to earnings of million for fiscal from operations of unconsolidated entities  including joint ventures  which are accounted for using the equity method 
the increased earnings in fiscal reflect the increased activity in several of our unconsolidated entities related to military family housing privatization  maintenance services and environmental services 
other comprehensive income loss changed from fiscal to fiscal as the result of a significant change in the minimum pension liability and the gain on our foreign currency transactions 
the increase in minimum pension liability was primarily due to an adjustment in the mortality rate of the participants of our pension plans and a decrease in discount rate assumptions during fiscal  while the change in our foreign currency transactions was caused by a fluctuating valuation of the us dollar as primarily compared to the euro and great britain s pound 
the losses from discontinued operations of million  net of taxes for fiscal  as compared to a loss of million  net of taxes for fiscal  reflect discontinued operations  contract termination costs  and other costs associated with the sale of roche limited  consulting group roche and the sale of our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses during fiscal and fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we also had a gain of million  net of tax  on the sale of roche in fiscal and a million impairment charge  net of tax  during fiscal in connection with the classification of our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses as assets held for sale 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million income tax expense to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to our uk pension liability 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this expense has no impact on cash tax paid or our ability to deduct the related expenses to reduce future cash tax payable in the uk 
currently  uk tax laws do not provide an expiration date for net operating loss carryforwards  therefore these deductions can be carried forward indefinitely and used to offset future taxable income that we generate in the uk 
although the deferred tax assets related to these pension liabilities were recorded to shareholder s equity through other comprehensive income the accounting rules require that valuation allowances against those deferred tax assets be recognized as a charge through income tax expense 
excluding the million valuation allowance discussed above  our effective tax rate for was 
the increase over is due to the mix of foreign including foreign export revenues versus domestic work  and our assessment of our potential inability to utilize certain net operating losses in the foreseeable future that are being generated by some of our foreign subsidiaries 
we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately  although the rate may vary depending primarily on the profitability of subsidiaries in certain foreign jurisdictions

table of contents ecm segment gross profit and gross profit percentages gross profit for fiscal was million or compared to million or 
the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage was due to increased profitability on energy projects  settlement of a dispute with our customer on a major epc project  which resulted in the release of accruals  increase in maintenance services  and a decrease in losses in our uk operations resulting from efforts to make those operations more productive and efficient 
the increase in gross profit during fiscal was partially offset by our agreement to perform additional tasks related to the tva nuclear restart project that were previously not included in our scope of work as discussed above and an impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the equipment that had been received in settlement of claims during fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements 
backlog ecm segment s backlog has increased billion or from august  primarily due to growth in both our fossil fuel epc and our chemical backlog 
the fossil fuel backlog increased substantially due to awards relating to flue gas desulphurization fgd for multiple customers  and a megawatt coal unit designed to use circulating fluidized bed technology 
chemical backlog increased primarily as a result of a letter of intent for an ethylene plant in saudi arabia and clean fuel projects in north america 
this was offset by the result of scheduled progress on major gas fired energy epc projects in new york and utah and completion of two chemical projects  including the ethylene plant in china 
we also experienced an increase in our backlog due to the increase in the scope of work associated with the tva nuclear restart project and other project awards in the nuclear energy and chemical industries  offset by progress on existing maintenance service contracts 
fiscal compared to fiscal executive summary reduction in the number of domestic new construction energy projects caused revenues to decrease from fiscal to fiscal however  this decrease was slightly offset by higher revenues from the transmission and distribution sector through our eds acquisition in december  and e i service contracts supporting us government projects in iraq 
we also experienced increasing activity in our former ecm and e i segments as reflected in the increase in the backlog amounts as of august  compared to august  gross profit for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal primarily as the result of charges related to the covert and harquahala projects and a decrease in the overall activity of the construction of new domestic energy plants 
for fiscal  general and administrative expenses were of revenues as compared to for fiscal  however there was a charge of million in fiscal related to the accelerated depreciation of certain software assets  which when factored  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal were relatively consistent with fiscal during fiscal  we sold our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses  part of our f m segment for million in cash 
in connection with this asset disposal  we recognized a million  net of tax  impairment charge for fiscal the results of these businesses have been restated as discontinued operations

gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for fiscal was million or as compared to million or for fiscal the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage is due primarily to a reduction in the estimated cost to complete a major fixed price contract impacting gross profit in  a favorable contract settlement on a completed project in  favorable completion activities on a major time and materials project and revisions to cost estimates based on revised scope activities yielded additional gross profit in  a reduction in a warranty liability in  and an increase for a one time reduction in an employee benefits accrual relating to a change in an employee benefits policy in gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal and fiscal reflect an increase decrease in cost of revenues of million and million  respectively  for amortization of contract asset liability adjustments related to contracts acquired in the it group acquisition  and million and million for fiscal and  respectively  for the recognition of accrued losses related to contracts acquired in the it group acquisition 
backlog backlog for the e i segment was billion as of august  compared to billion as of august  the increase is primarily attributable to a continuous backlog derived from our domestic commercial customers  increased awards for services to us government customers in iraq  and the award of a world wide contract with related backlog 
these increases were offset by scheduled work and completed projects during fiscal e c segment revenues the decrease in revenues of million or in segment revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the following factors the completion and winding down of several domestic new construction energy plants that commenced prior to fiscal  specifically the completion of gas fired energy generation projects during fiscal and early fiscal  and

our profits for fiscal were positively impacted by gross profit recognition on certain projects that were substantially complete prior to fiscal due to favorable resolution of remaining estimated costs and exposures on such projects 
the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal as compared to fiscal was partially offset by an increase in gross profit due to the increase in activity as we ramp up progress on two combined cycle energy plants in queens  new york and mona  utah  an increase in profit related to sales of our proprietary technology from our badger joint venture which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  an increase in activity on the tva nuclear restart project beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  and the positive impact on gross profit from the acquisition of eds which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal gross profit and gross profit percentage reflect an increase decrease in cost of revenues for amortization of contract liability adjustments related to contracts acquired in the fiscal stone webster acquisition

our fossil fuel epc backlog included the uncompleted portions of a fixed priced epc contract and a target priced epc contract to build gas fired combined cycle energy plants 
additionally  backlog increased due to a new customer contract for cleaner air emissions on four energy plants as well as the expansion of epc services to an existing customer related to cleaner air emissions 
backlog also increased for the expansion of nuclear and chemical maintenance services to both new and existing customers 
f m segment revenues the decrease in revenues of million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to reduced domestic demand  primarily from energy customers  without material offsetting increases in other industry sectors

the million of accelerated depreciation included million of amortization that would have been recorded on these assets in fiscal had we not accelerated the amortization resulting in a net increase of general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal interest expense was approximately million for fiscal  compared to approximately million for fiscal the increase over prior year was primarily due to the issuance on march  of approximately million  senior notes  partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to lyons repurchases with a total amortized value of approximately million in late fiscal and throughout fiscal our interest costs also included the amortization of loan fees associated with the senior notes  the lyons and the credit facility  as well as unused line of credit and letter of credit fees  and therefore  our interest expense was higher than would be expected based on our borrowing levels and the stated interest rates 

table of contents interest income for fiscal decreased to approximately million as compared to million for fiscal  as a result of lower levels of invested funds due to use of working capital  acquisitions and cash paid for the repurchase of a portion of the lyons 
the lyons repurchases in fiscal resulted in a loss of approximately million which included expenses and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
we recognized a gain of million on lyon repurchases in fiscal we also recorded foreign currency transaction losses of million in fiscal  as compared to a gain of million in fiscal these foreign currency transaction losses were primarily due to us dollar denominated cash accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency strengthened compared to the us dollar in fiscal and fiscal although these foreign currency transaction gains losses were reflected in the statements of operations  substantially all of these gains losses did not directly impact our cash position on a consolidated basis 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal our tax rate was significantly impacted by the mix of foreign including foreign export revenues versus domestic work and deferred tax valuation allowances

sfas 
sfas no 
addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the provisions in sfas are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   which is effective with our first quarter of fiscal adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
regarding the staff s interpretation of sfas no 
r 
this interpretation provides the staff s views regarding interactions between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
the interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of sfas no 
r and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided 
we will follow the guidance prescribed in sab no 
in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we have also decided that we will use the modified prospective method for our adoption of sfas r  and anticipate that the related compensation expense that will be recognized during fiscal will range from million to million 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principles 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
under previous guidance  changes in accounting principle were recognized as a cumulative affect in the net income of the period of the change 
sfas requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle  limited to the direct effects of the change  to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
additionally  this statement requires that a change in depreciation  amortization or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle and that correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the provisions in sfas are effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december   which is effective with our first quarter of our fiscal we intend to adopt the disclosure requirements upon the effective date of the pronouncement 
we do not believe that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in june  the eitf reached consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements eitf eitf provides guidance on determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or acquired subsequent to lease inception 
the guidance in eitf will be applied prospectively and is effective for periods beginning after june  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
effects of inflation we expect to continue to focus our operations on cost reimbursable and negotiated fixed price contracts 
to the extent that a significant portion of our revenues are earned under cost reimbursable type contracts  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations should be reduced 
however  if we expand our business into markets and geographical areas where fixed price work is more prevalent  inflation may begin to have a larger impact on our results of operations 
to the extent permitted by competition  we expect to continue to emphasize contracts that are either cost reimbursable or negotiated fixed price 
for contracts where we accept with fixed price terms  we monitor closely the actual costs on the project as they compare to the budget estimates 
on these projects  we also attempt to secure fixed price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors 
however  due to the competitive nature of our industry  combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel  equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts  there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future 
risk factors investing in our common stock will provide an investor with an equity ownership interest

the performance of our shares will reflect the performance of our business relative to  among other things  general economic and industry conditions  market conditions and competition 
the value of the investment may increase or decrease and could result in a loss 
an investor should carefully consider the following factors as well as other information contained in this form k  including the discussion of our critical accounting polices  before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
this form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risk factors described below and the other factors described elsewhere in this form k 
demand for our products and services are cyclical and vulnerable to downturns in the industries to which we market our products and services 
the demand for our products and services depends on conditions in the environmental and infrastructure industry and the energy industry  which accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our backlog as of august   and  to a lesser extent  on conditions in the petrochemical  chemical and refining industries 
these industries historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the domestic and international economies 
our results of operations have varied and may continue to vary depending on the demand for future projects from these industries 
the dollar amount of our backlog  as stated at any given time  is not necessarily indicative of our future earnings 
as of august   our backlog was approximately billion 
there can be no assurance that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
further  project terminations  suspensions or adjustments in scope may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog 
our backlog consists of projects for which we have signed contracts or commitments from customers 
commitments may be in the form of written contracts for specific projects  letters of intent  purchase orders  or indications of the amounts of time and materials we need to make available for customers anticipated projects 
backlog includes expected revenue based on engineering and design specifications that may not be final and could be revised over time 
backlog includes revenues for maintenance contracts that may not specify actual dollar amounts of maintenance work to be performed 
for these contracts  backlog is based on an estimate of work to be performed based on our knowledge of customers historic maintenance requirements 
the amount of future actual awards may be more or less than our estimates 
we also include in backlog commitments from certain individual customers that have committed to more than one significant epc project and other customers who have committed to multi year orders for environmental  piping or maintenance services 
there can be 
table of contents no assurance that the customers will complete all of these projects or that the projects will be performed in the currently anticipated time frame 
backlog at august   included a major ethylene facility epc project in saudi arabia for which we had a letter of intent at august  it also included a major fossil power facility epc project in louisiana for which we had a letter of intent at august   and executed an epc contract in september reductions in backlog due to cancellation by a customer or for other reasons adversely affect  potentially to a material extent  the revenues we actually receive from contracts included in backlog 
many of the contracts in backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event customers cancel projects 
these cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out of pocket costs  revenues for work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed  but typically we have no contractual right upon cancellation to the total revenues reflected in our backlog 
projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time 
if we were to experience significant cancellations or delays of projects in our backlog  our financial condition could be significantly adversely affected 
backlog estimates are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to the amounts included in backlog 
our backlog does not include any projects funded or unfunded that we expect will be performed more than five years after the date of our financial statements 
the amount of future actual projects may be more or less than our estimates 
our projects may encounter difficulties that may result in additional costs to us  reductions in revenues  claims  disputes or the payment of actual and or liquidated damages 
our projects generally involve complex design and engineering  significant procurement of equipment and supplies  and extensive construction management 
we may encounter difficulties in the design or engineering  equipment and supply delivery  schedule changes  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule 
in addition  we generally rely on third party equipment manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to assist us with the completion of our contracts 
in some cases  the equipment we purchase for a project or that is provided to us by the customer does not perform as expected  and these performance failures may result in delays in completion of the project or additional costs to us or the customer to complete the project and  in some cases  may require us to obtain alternate equipment at additional cost 
any delay by subcontractors to complete their portion of the project  or any failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily complete its portion of the project  and other factors beyond our control may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs  or both 
these delays and additional costs may be substantial  and we may be required to compensate the project customer for these delays 
while we may recover these additional costs from the responsible vendor  subcontractor or other third party  we may not be able to recover all of these costs in all circumstances 
many of our engineering procurement and construction epc projects involve design  engineering  procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods  often in excess of two years 
for example  we recorded a million pre tax loss  net of tax for the first quarter of fiscal relating to two epc projects for gas fired combined cycle energy plants in michigan and arizona 
the charges were the result of project completion delays 
in addition  certain contracts may require that our customers provide us with design or engineering information or with equipment or materials to be used on the project 
in some cases  the customer may provide us with deficient design or engineering information or equipment or may provide the information or equipment to us later than required by the project schedule 
the customer may also determine  after commencement of the project  to change various elements of the project 
our epc project contracts generally require the customer to compensate us for additional work or expenses incurred due to customer requested change orders or failure of the customer to provide us with specified design or engineering information or equipment 
under these circumstances  we generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us 
we are subject to the risk that we are unable to obtain  through negotiation  arbitration  litigation or otherwise  adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to customer requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely provide required items 
a failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require us to record an adjustment to amounts of revenues and gross profit that were recognized in prior periods 
any such adjustments  if substantial  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as is more fully discussed in critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the 
table of contents notes to our consolidated financial statements  a substantial portion of our revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion  or poc  method of accounting 
this accounting method is standard for engineering  procurement and construction  or epc  contracts 
the poc accounting practices that we use result in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
contract losses are recognized in full when determined  and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability 
further  a substantial portion of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from the contracts  and adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded when known or finalized  which is generally during the latter stages of the contract 
in addition  we record claims when we believe recovery or payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
actual collection or payment of claims could differ from estimated amounts 
although a significant portion of our contracts are cost reimbursable and our financial loss exposure on cost reimbursable contracts is generally limited  it is possible that the loss provisions or adjustments to the contract profit and loss resulting from future changes in our estimates or contract penalty provisions could be significant and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings or result in losses 
in certain circumstances it is possible that such adjustments could be material to our operating results 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements 
to prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make estimates and assumptions  as of the date of the financial statements  which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by our management include contract costs and profits and application of percentage of completion accounting and revenue recognition of contract claims  recoverability of inventory and application of lower of cost or market accounting  provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors  vendors and others  provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances  recoverability of goodwill  recoverability of other intangibles and related estimated lives  valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations  valuation of defined benefit pension plans  and accruals for estimated liabilities  including litigation and insurance reserves 
our actual results could differ from those estimates 
non compliance with covenants in our credit facility  without waiver or amendment from the lenders of the credit facility  could adversely affect our ability to borrow under the credit facility 
our credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and a defined minimum net worth 
in addition  the defined terms used in calculating the financial covenants  in accordance with the credit facility  often require us to follow generally accepted accounting principles which requires the use of judgments and estimates  and may change from time to time based on new accounting pronouncements 
we may not be able to satisfy these ratios  especially if our operating results fall below management s expectations as a result of  but not limited to  the impact of other risk factors that may have a negative impact on our future earnings 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our credit facility 
a future breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facility  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amendments 
in the event of any default not otherwise amended  the lenders there under will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us and could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable  or require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings and cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit at that time 
if we are unable to repay borrowings with respect to our credit facility when due  the lenders there under could proceed against their collateral  which consists of substantially all of our assets  including property  equipment and real estate 
if the indebtedness under our credit facility was to be accelerated  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
as of august   we had million outstanding borrowings under the credit facility with outstanding letters of credit inclusive of both 
table of contents domestic financial and domestic performance of approximately million and indebtedness under our senior notes of million 
in addition  although our senior notes contain no cross default provisions  we have entered into indemnity agreements with our sureties that do contain cross default provisions 
accordingly  in the event of a default under our credit facility  we would need to obtain a waiver or amendment to these provisions 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in obtaining any such amendment or waiver 
restrictive covenants in our credit facility and the indenture relating to the senior notes may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our credit facility contains certain restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations or issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make distributions to our shareholders  repurchase or redeem our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  create liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us  make capital expenditures  enter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates  sell and pledge assets  and acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
our credit facility requires us to achieve certain financial ratios  including a leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a defined minimum net worth 
we may not be able to satisfy these ratios  especially if our operating results fall below management s expectations 
in addition  in order to remain in compliance with the covenants in our credit facility  we may be limited in our flexibility to take actions resulting in non cash charges  including as a result of our settling claims 
these covenants may impair our ability to engage in favorable business activities and our ability to finance future operations or capital needs 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facility 
see risk factor  non compliance with covenants in our credit facility  without waiver or amendment from the lenders of the credit facility  could adversely affect our ability to borrow under the credit facility 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to fulfill our obligations under our senior notes and our credit facility 
as of august   we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately million  approximately million of which was secured indebtedness  including obligations under capital leases 
in addition  as of august   letters of credit  domestic and foreign  issued for our account in an aggregate amount of million were outstanding and we had borrowings of million under our new credit facility 
our indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following it will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  reducing the availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  it will limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements and other purposes  it will limit our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business  it may place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  it may make us more vulnerable to a further downturn in the economy of our business  and it may restrict us from making additional acquisitions or exploiting other business opportunities 
to the extent that new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt levels  the substantial leverage risks described above would increase 

table of contents we are currently the subject of an informal inquiry by the sec 
on june   we were notified by the staff of the securities and exchange commission  or sec  that the staff is conducting an informal inquiry relating to our financial statements 
the sec has not advised us as to either the reason for the inquiry or its precise scope 
however  the requests for information we have received to date appear to primarily relate to the purchase method of accounting for various acquisitions 
we have been cooperating with the sec  including providing documents and responding to requests for voluntary production  as well as conducting a detailed review of our accounting for our acquisitions 
this review may have consequences independent of the inquiry  including restatement of our financial results for past periods 
in addition  if the sec takes further action  it may escalate the informal inquiry into a formal investigation  which may result in an enforcement action or other legal proceedings against us and potentially members of our management 
responding to such actions or proceedings have been and could continue to be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management team  including senior officers 
if any such action or proceeding is resolved unfavorably to us or any of them  we or they could be subject to injunctions  fines  increased review and scrutiny by regulatory authorities and other penalties or sanctions  including criminal sanctions  that could materially and adversely affect our business operations  financial performance  liquidity and future prospects and materially adversely affect the trading market and price of our stock 
any unfavorable actions could also result in private civil actions  loss of key personnel or other adverse consequences 
we have been named in various purported class action shareholder lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits 
we  our directors and certain of our current and former officers have been named as defendants in various purported class action shareholder lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits 
a discussion of these lawsuits appears in note of our consolidated financial statements 
although it is not possible at this early stage to predict the likely outcome of these actions  an adverse result in any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are and will continue to be involved in litigation 
we have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects and other matters 
these are typically actions that arise in the normal course of business  including employment related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occurs in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites 
our contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the performance of equipment  design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by our subsidiaries 
to date  we have been able to obtain liability insurance for the operation of our business 
however  if we sustain damages that materially exceed our insurance coverage or that are not insured  there could be a material adverse effect on our liquidity  which could impair our operations 
see note and note of our consolidated financial statements 
downgrades by rating agencies may require us to modify existing bonding facilities or obtain new bonding facilities 
in the event our debt ratings are lowered by moody s investors service or standards and poor s in the future  those downgrades might make it harder for us to obtain surety bonding for new projects in the future  and we may be required to increase or provide cash collateral to obtain these surety bonds  which would reduce our available cash or availability under our credit facility 
we anticipate any such new or modified bonding facilities would not be on terms as attractive as those we have currently and that we would also be subject to increased costs of capital and interest rates 
the nature of our contracts could adversely affect us 
approximately of our backlog as of august   was from cost reimbursable contracts  the remaining was from fixed price contracts 
revenues and gross profit from cost reimbursable  long term contracts can be significantly affected by contract incentives penalties that may not be known or finalized until the later stages of the contracts 
a significant number of our domestic piping contracts and substantially all of our international piping contracts are fixed price 
in addition  a number of the contracts we assumed in the stone webster and it group acquisitions were fixed price contracts  and we will continue to enter into these types of contracts in the future 
under fixed price contracts  we agree to perform the contract for a fixed price and  as a result  benefit from costs savings and earnings from approved change orders  but we are generally unable to recover any cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under maximum price contracts  we share with the customer any savings up to a negotiated or target ceiling 
when costs exceed the negotiated ceiling price  we may be required to reduce our fee or to absorb some or all of the cost overruns 
contract prices are established based in part on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations 
our profit for these projects could decrease or we could experience losses if we are unable to secure fixed pricing commitments from our suppliers at the time the contracts are entered into or if we experience cost increases for material or labor during the performance of the contracts 

table of contents we enter into contractual agreements with customers for some of our engineering  procurement and construction services to be performed based on agreed upon reimbursable costs and labor rates 
some of these contracts provide for the customer s review of the accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced 
these reviews could result in reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the customer 
many of our contracts require us to satisfy specified design  engineering  procurement or construction milestones in order to receive payment for the work completed or equipment or supplies procured prior to achievement of the applicable milestone 
as a result  under these types of arrangements  we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment 
if the customer determines not to proceed with the completion of the project or if the customer defaults on its payment obligations  we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended to purchase equipment or supplies 
in addition  many of our customers for large epc projects are project specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the epc project 
it may be difficult for us to collect amounts owed to us by these customers against the customer s more credit worthy parent company 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us for these matters  we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project which could result in a material loss 
we are subject to the risks associated with being a government contractor 
we are a major provider of services to governmental agencies and therefore are exposed to risks associated with government contracting  including reductions in government spending  cancelled or delayed appropriations specific to our projects  heightened competition and modified or terminated contracts 
for example  most of our government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process 
some government contracts are awarded to multiple competitors  who increase overall competition and pricing pressure and may require us to make sustained post award efforts to realize revenues under these government contracts 
legislatures typically appropriate funds for a given program on a year by year basis  even though contract performance may take more than one year and are not always guaranteed 
as a result  at the beginning of a project  the related contract may be only partially funded  and additional funding is normally committed only as appropriations are made in each subsequent year 
these appropriations  and the timing of payment of appropriated amounts  may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing political priorities  curtailments in the use of government contracting firms  budget constraints  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures 
if legislative appropriations are not made in subsequent years of a multiple year contract  we will not realize all of our potential revenues and profits from that contract 
a reduction in spending by federal government agencies could also limit our ability to obtain additional contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  government customers typically can terminate or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience  and some of these government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually 
if a government customer terminates a contract or fails to renew or extend a contract  our backlog may be reduced or we may incur a loss  either of which could impair our financial condition and operating results 
for the year ended august   of backlog was generated from us governmental agencies 
a termination due to our unsatisfactory performance could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in cases where we are a subcontractor  the prime contract under which we are a subcontractor could be terminated  regardless of the quality of our services as a subcontractor or our relationship with the relevant government agency 
our government customers can also reduce the value of existing contracts  issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our services and associated materials 
as a result of our government contracting business  we have been  are and will be in the future  the subject of audits and or cost reviews by the defense contract audit agency  which we refer to as dcaa  or by other contracting and oversight agencies 
this is especially true of the highly publicized emergency response services for hurricane disaster relief and reconstruction in the gulf coast which we have provided and will continue to provide during fiscal additionally  we have been and may in the future be the subject of investigations by governmental agencies such as the office of inspector general of the department of defense 
during the course of an audit  the dcaa may disallow costs if it determines that we improperly accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with cost accounting standards or regulatory and contractual requirements 
under the type of cost reimbursable government contracts that we typically perform  only those costs that are reasonable  allocable and allowable are recoverable under the federal acquisition regulation and cost accounting standards 
such cost disallowances may result in adjustments to previously reported revenues 

table of contents in addition  our failure to comply with the terms of one or more of our government contracts  other government agreements  or government regulations and statutes could result in our being suspended or barred from future government contract projects for a significant period of time and possible civil or criminal fines and penalties of applicable regulations and statutes and the risk of public scrutiny of our performance at high profile sites 
this could materially adversely affect our business 
our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts could adversely affect us 
in certain circumstances  we guarantee facility completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels 
failure to meet any such schedule or performance requirements could result in additional costs  and the amount of such additional costs could exceed projected profits 
these additional costs include liquidated damages paid under contractual penalty provisions  which can be substantial and can accrue on a daily basis 
in addition  our actual costs could exceed our projections 
performance problems for existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and our client base 
for examples of the kinds of claims which may result from liquidated damages provisions and cost overruns see note of our consolidated financial statements 
our dependence on subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could adversely affect us 
we rely on third party equipment manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to complete our projects 
to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed price work  we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a subcontractor or a manufacturer is unable to deliver its services  equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason  including the deterioration of its financial condition  we may be required to purchase the services  equipment or materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services  equipment or materials were needed 
possible cost escalation associated with our fixed price contracts could negatively affect our profitability 
we estimate total contract costs in pricing our fixed price contracts incorporating assumptions to address inflation and fluctuations in market price for materials 
however  we can not predict these variable components with certainty as they relate to our pricing of fixed price contracts 
as a result  we may incur total costs that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs 
these increased costs could contribute to a lower than expected return or losses on our projects that are not governed by escalation clauses 
our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts 
a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly derived from large scale domestic and international projects 
it is generally very difficult to predict whether and when we will receive such awards as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors  such as market conditions  financing arrangements  governmental approvals and environmental matters 
because a significant portion of our revenues is generated from large projects  our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards 
in addition  many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and  as a result  we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project 
in certain circumstances  customers may require us to provide credit enhancements  including bonds or letters of credit 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance and surety bonds to customers 
these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond  we cannot pursue that project 
we have a bonding facility but  as is typically the case  the issuance of bonds under that facility is at the surety s sole discretion 
moreover  due to events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally  bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost 
there can be no assurance that bonds will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms 
our inability to obtain adequate bonding and  as a result  to bid on new work could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects 
the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs 
in some cases  we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than called for under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we could incur costs that 
table of contents could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  our significant customers vary between years  and the loss of any one or more of our key customers could have a material adverse impact on us 
in addition  timing of the revenues  earnings and cash flows from our projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  including unavoidable delays from weather conditions  unavailability of material and equipment from vendors  changes in the scope of services requested by clients or labor disruptions 
our environmental and infrastructure operations may subject us to potential contractual and operational costs and liabilities 
many of our e i segment customers attempt to shift financial and operating risks to the contractor  particularly on projects involving large scale cleanups and or projects where there may be a risk that the contamination could be more extensive or difficult to resolve than previously anticipated 
in this competitive market  customers increasingly try to pressure contractors to accept greater risks of performance  liability for damage or injury to third parties or property and liability for fines and penalties 
prior to our acquisition of the it group  the it group was involved in claims and litigation involving disputes over such issues 
therefore  it is possible that we could also become involved in similar claims and litigation in the future as a result of our acquisition of the assets of it group and our participation in separate environmental and infrastructure contracts 
environmental management contractors also potentially face liabilities to third parties for property damage or personal injury stemming from exposure to or a release of toxic  hazardous or radioactive substances resulting from a project performed for customers 
these liabilities could arise long after completion of a project 
although the risks we face in our anthrax and other biological agent work are similar to those faced in our toxic chemical emergency response business  the risks posed by attempting to detect and remediate these biological agents may include risks to our employees  subcontractors and those who may be affected should detection and remediation prove less effective than anticipated 
because anthrax and similar contamination is so recent  there may be unknown risks involved  and in certain circumstances there may be no body of knowledge or standard protocols for dealing with these risks 
the risks we face with respect to biological agents may also include the potential ineffectiveness of developing technologies to detect and remediate the contamination  claims for infringement of these technologies  difficulties in working with the smaller  specialized firms that may own these technologies and have detection and remediation capabilities  our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and subcontractors in light of these risks  the high profile nature of the work and the potential unavailability of insurance and indemnification 
over the past several years  the epa and other federal agencies have significantly constricted the circumstances under which they will indemnify their contractors against liabilities incurred in connection with the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended  or cercla  and similar projects 
we are exposed to certain risks associated with our integrated environmental solutions businesses 
certain subsidiaries within our e i division are engaged in two similar programs that may involve assumption of a client s environmental remediation obligations and potential claim obligations 
one program involves our subsidiary  the landbank group  inc  or landbank  which was acquired in the it group acquisition 
under this program  landbank purchases and then remediates and or takes other steps to improve environmentally impaired properties 
the second program is operated by our subsidiary shaw environmental liability solutions  llc  which plans to contractually assume responsibility for environmental matters at a particular site or sites and provide indemnifications for defined cleanup costs and post closing third party claims in return for compensation by the client 
these subsidiaries may operate and or purchase and redevelop environmentally impaired property 
as the owner or operator of such properties  we may be required to clean up all contamination at these sites even if we did not place the contamination there 
we attempt to reduce our exposure to unplanned risks through the performance of environmental due diligence  the use of liability protection provisions of federal laws like the brownfields revitalization act and similar state laws and the purchase of environmental and cost cap insurance coverage or other risk management products 
however  we cannot assure you that our risk management strategies and these products and laws will adequately protect us in all circumstances or that no material adverse impact will occur 
our ability to be profitable in this type of business also depends on our ability to accurately estimate cleanup costs 
while we engage in comprehensive engineering and cost analyses  if we were to materially underestimate the required cost of cleanup at a particular project  such underestimation could significantly adversely affect us 
further  the continued growth of this type of business is dependent upon the availability of environmental and cost cap insurance or other risk management products 
we cannot be assured or provide assurance that such products will continue to be available to us in the future or  if it is available  at an economically feasible cost 
moreover  environmental laws and regulations governing the cleanup of contaminated sites are constantly changing 
we cannot predict the effect of future changes to these laws and regulations on our landbank and environmental liability solutions businesses 
in addition  prior to the it group acquisition  we had not previously conducted this type of business and we have had no material 
table of contents transactions in this business 
additionally  when we purchase real estate in this business  we are subject to many of the same risks as real estate developers  including the timely receipt of building and zoning permits  construction delays  the ability of markets to absorb new development projects  market fluctuations and the ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing on satisfactory terms  among others 
the limitation or the modification of the price anderson act s indemnification authority could adversely affect our business 
the price anderson act  or paa  comprehensively regulates the manufacture  use and storage of radioactive materials  while promoting the nuclear energy industry by offering broad indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and doe contractors 
because we provide services for the doe relating to its nuclear weapons facilities and the nuclear energy industry in the ongoing maintenance and modification  as well as decontamination and decommissioning  of its nuclear energy plants  we are entitled to the indemnification protections under the paa 
although the paa s indemnification provisions are broad  it does not apply to all liabilities that we might incur while performing services as a radioactive materials cleanup contractor for the doe and the nuclear energy industry 
the paa s ability to indemnify us with respect to any new facilities has reauthorized and extended through if the paa s indemnification authority is not applicable  our business could be adversely affected by either a refusal of operations of new facilities to retain us or our inability to obtain commercially adequate insurance and indemnification 
environmental factors and changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities and affect the demand for our services 
in addition to the environmental risks described above relating to the businesses acquired from it group and our environmental remediation business  our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning emissions into the air  discharges into waterways  generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  and health and safety 
our projects often involve highly regulated materials  including hazardous and nuclear materials and wastes 
environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for regulated materials and require us to obtain a permit and comply with various other requirements 
the improper characterization  handling  or disposal of regulated materials or any other failure to comply with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations or associated environmental permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to perform 
in addition  under cercla and comparable state laws  we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated materials 
cercla and these comparable state laws typically impose joint and several  strict liability without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release  and liability for the entire cost of clean up can be imposed upon any responsible party 
the principal federal environmental  health and safety legislation affecting our operations and the operations of our clients include the national environmental policy act  the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  the clean air act  the occupational safety and health act  the toxic substances control act  the federal water pollution control act  cercla  and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act  as each has been amended from time to time 
our foreign operations are also subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to environmental protection 
we could also incur environmental liability at sites where we have been hired by potentially responsible parties  or prps  to remediate contamination of the site 
such prps have sought to expand the reach of cercla  rcra and similar state statutes to make the remediation contractor responsible for cleanup costs 
these companies claim that environmental contractors are owners or operators of hazardous waste facilities or that the contractors arranged for treatment  transportation or disposal of hazardous substances 
if we are held responsible under cercla or rcra for damages caused while performing services or otherwise  we may be forced to incur such cleanup costs by ourselves  notwithstanding the potential availability of contribution or indemnification from other parties 
the environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject are constantly changing  and it is impossible to predict the effect of any future changes to these laws and regulations on us 
we do not yet know the full extent  if any  of environmental liabilities associated with many of our recently acquired properties undergoing or scheduled to undergo site restoration  as well as any liabilities associated with the assets we acquired from stone webster and it group 
we cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations and that such noncompliance would not significantly adversely affect us 

table of contents the level of enforcement of these laws and regulations also affects the demand for many of our services 
the perception that enforcement of current environmental laws and regulations has been reduced has decreased the demand for some services 
future changes to environmental  health and safety laws and regulations or to enforcement of those laws and regulations could result in increased or decreased demand for some of our services 
the ultimate impact of the proposed changes will depend upon a number of factors  including the overall strength of the economy and clients views on the cost effectiveness of remedies available under the changed laws and regulations 
if proposed or enacted changes materially reduce demand for our environmental services  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
development and construction risks and other risks associated with our military family housing privatization contracts could impact our profitability and a loss of our investment 
development and construction activities conducted through various joint ventures with one strategic partner expose us to risks including we may be unable to obtain  or may be subject to delays in obtaining necessary permitting  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs  we may incur construction costs related to new construction or renovations that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs 
these increased costs could contribute to a lower than expected return and we may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs annually  we may be unable to complete construction of a property on schedule and meet financial goals for development  and we may incur construction costs that are higher or have project delays if we are not successful in forming strategic alliances with key material suppliers and vendors 
other risks directly associated with our dependence on the us military include we may be unable to obtain the necessary levels of occupancy and rents  which could result in lower than expected returns and in some cases losses 
rents are determined by congress annually through appropriations for basic allowance for housing bah for all of the branches of the us military 
we cannot assure you that the appropriations each year will occur on a timely basis  or that the amount of bah appropriations will be sufficient to keep up with escalations in the cost of living expenses 
congress may change the law and the dod can revise its procedures at any time 
we cannot assure you that such changes will not be made and  if changes are made  such changes may have a material adverse effect on the level of our income generated by our privatization projects  we cannot assure you that the military bases where we have military family housing projects will remain active or that their functions and or staffing levels will not be materially reduced such that we will be unable to lease military family housing units to members of the us military 
the dod has  from time to time  closed military bases and realigned and or reduced the functions and staffing levels at certain bases under the base realignment and closure brac initiative 
these military family housing projects are supported by military residents based on current military needs and geographic deployment of the residents  and we may not be able to close on our five remaining military family housing privatization projects as we have only been selected to receive the right to enter into exclusive negotiations and the award is subject to final approval from the us military branch and congress 
until final approval is obtained  which generally can last between six months to one year  we will incur costs associated with the development plan and design that may be significant 
we cannot assure you that we will receive final approval and failure to recover these development costs may result in losses 
ultimately  these risks could have an adverse effect on our profitability and expose us to possible losses as well as the loss of our investment in these military family housing privatizations 
during fiscal  we contributed million to these housing privatizations 
our working capital requirements may increase as a result of our work associated with the military family housing privatization market 
during fiscal  there were no new contract awards to privatize military family housing with our joint venture partner  cei  under the dod s military family housing privatization initiative 
during fiscal  three of the five contracts awarded in fiscal were closed  one could close later in fiscal  depending on pending resolution of brac determination  and one closed in fiscal one previously awarded contract was cancelled  and then re bid during fiscal 
table of contents these privatization contracts require initial capital contributions in the early stages of the project and ultimately permanent financing from a third party lender 
as of august   we were not scheduled to make any significant equity contributions during fiscal in addition  because occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed property may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  we may be unable to meet our profitability goals for that property 
if our partners fail to perform their contractual obligations on a project  we could be exposed to loss of reputation and additional financial performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or losses 
we often enter into various joint ventures as part of our environmental and engineering  procurement and construction businesses so that we can jointly bid and perform on a particular project 
the success of these and other joint ventures depends  in large part  on the satisfactory performance of the contractual obligations of our joint venture partners 
if our partners do not meet their obligations  the joint venture may be unable to adequately perform and deliver its contracted services 
under these circumstances  we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
these additional obligations could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture  which could also affect our reputation in the industries we serve 
our dependence on one or a few customers could adversely affect us 
due to the size of many engineering and construction projects  one or a few clients have in the past and may in the future contribute a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years 
for example  in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were generated from ten major customers including governmental and commercial 
similarly  our backlog frequently reflects multiple projects for individual clients  therefore  one major customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a point in time 
an example of this is the tva  with which we have two contracts representing an aggregate of of our backlog at august  including our backlog from tva  a government owned entity  backlog from the us government or us government owned entities accounted for of backlog at august  because these significant customers generally contract with us for specific projects  we may lose these customers from year to year as their projects with us are completed 
if we do not replace them with other customers or other projects  our business could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  we have long standing relationships with many significant customers  including customers with which we have alliance agreements that have preferred pricing arrangements 
however  our contracts with these customers are on a project by project basis  and they may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their purchases at any time 
the loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
if we experience delays and or defaults in customer payments  we could be unable to recover all expenditures 
because of the nature of our contracts  at times we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on projects as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment 
if a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources  it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 
our projects expose us to potential professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims 
we engineer  construct and perform services in large industrial facilities in which accidents or system failures can be disastrous 
any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits at locations engineered or constructed by us or where our products are installed or services performed could result in significant professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims against us 
in addition  under some of our contracts  we must use new metals or processes for producing or fabricating pipe for our customers 
the failure of any of these metals or processes could result in warranty claims against us for significant replacement or reworking costs 
further  the engineering and construction projects we perform expose us to additional risks including cost overruns  equipment failures  personal injuries  property damage  shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor disputes  weather problems and unforeseen engineering  architectural  environmental and geological problems 
in addition  once our construction is complete  we may face claims with respect to the performance of these facilities 

table of contents we face substantial competition in each of our business segments 
in our e i segment  we compete with a diverse array of small and large organizations  including national and regional environmental management firms  national  regional and local architectural  engineering and construction firms  environmental management divisions or subsidiaries of international engineering  construction and systems companies  and waste generators that have developed in house capabilities 
increased competition in this business  combined with changes in client procurement procedures  has resulted in changes in the industry  including among other things  lower contract profits  more fixed price or unit price contracts and contract terms that may increasingly require us to indemnify our clients against damages or injuries to third parties and property and environmental fines and penalties 
we believe  therefore  these market conditions may require us to accept more contractual and performance risk than we have historically accepted for the environmental and infrastructure segment to be competitive 
the entry of large systems contractors and international engineering and construction firms into the environmental services industry has increased competition for major federal government contracts and programs  which have been a primary source of revenue in recent years for our e i business 
there can be no assurance that our e i segment will be able to compete successfully given the intense competition and trends in its industry 
in our e c and maintenance segments  we face competition from numerous regional  national and international competitors  many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
our competitors include well established  well financed concerns  both privately and publicly held  including many major energy equipment manufacturers and engineering and construction companies  some engineering companies  internal engineering departments at utilities and certain of our customers 
the markets that we serve require substantial resources and particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
in our f m segment  we face substantial competition on a domestic and international level 
in the united states  there are a number of smaller pipe fabricators 
internationally  our principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
some of our competitors  primarily in the international sector  have greater financial and other resources than we do 
political and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 
approximately of our fiscal revenues and of our revenues for fiscal were attributable to projects in international markets  some of which are subject to political unrest and uncertainty 
we have operations in the middle east  china  south america and europe 
the services we provide to our customers in iraq and other middle east countries have created several challenges  including identifying and retaining the appropriate subcontractors  the recruiting of qualified personnel and the ability to retain them  the safety of our employees and subcontractors and the increased working capital demands 
it is possible that our employees may suffer injury or death  repatriation problems or other unforeseen costs and risks in the course of their international projects  which could negatively impact our operations 
in addition to these specific challenges we face in the middle east  international contracts  operations and expansion expose us to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states  including uncertain economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we make capital investments  operate and sell products and services  the lack of well developed legal systems in some countries in which we operate and sell products and services  which could make it difficult for us to enforce our contractual rights  security and safety of employees  expropriation of property  restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency  political risks  including risks of loss due to civil strife  acts of war  guerrilla activities and insurrection  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles  currency fluctuations  logistical and communications challenges  potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices  including export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs and tax laws  changes in labor conditions  exposure to liability under the foreign corrupt practices act  and general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 

table of contents work stoppages and other labor problems could adversely affect us 
some of our employees in the united states and abroad are represented by labor unions 
we experienced a strike  without material impact on pipe production  by union members in february relating to the termination of collective bargaining agreements covering our pipe facilities in walker and prairieville  louisiana 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
from time to time we have also experienced attempts to unionize our non union shops 
while these efforts have achieved limited success to date  we cannot give any assurance that we will not experience additional union activity in the future 
adverse events could negatively affect our liquidity position 
our operations could require us to utilize large sums of working capital  sometimes on short notice and sometimes without the ability to recover the expenditures 
circumstances or events which could create large cash outflows include losses resulting from fixed price contracts  environmental liabilities  litigation risks  unexpected costs or losses resulting from acquisitions  contract initiation or completion delays  political conditions  customer payment problems  foreign exchange risks  professional and product liability claims  among others 
we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity or the credit capacity to meet all of our cash needs if we encounter significant working capital requirements as a result of these or other factors 
insufficient liquidity could have important consequences to us 
for example  we could have less operating flexibility due to restrictions which could be imposed by our creditors  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on our properties and paying dividends  have less success in obtaining new work if our sureties or our lenders were to limit our ability to provide new performance bonds or letters of credit for our projects  be required to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest associated with that debt  fail to comply with the terms of our credit facility  incur increased lending fees  costs and interest rates  and experience difficulty in financing future acquisitions and or continuing operations 
all or any of these matters could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with more liquidity and could have a negative impact upon our financial condition and results of operations 
foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects or to obtain projects 
we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in us dollars  however  from time to time we enter into contracts denominated in a foreign currency 
this practice subjects us to foreign exchange risks  particularly to the extent contract revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs 
we attempt to minimize our exposure from foreign exchange risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies  matching the contract revenues currency with the contract costs currency or entering into hedge contracts when there are different currencies for contract revenues and costs 
however  these actions will not always eliminate all foreign exchange risks 
foreign exchange controls may also adversely affect us 
for instance  foreign exchange controls were instituted in venezuela on february  these controls may limit our ability to repatriate profits from our venezuelan subsidiaries or otherwise convert local currency into us dollars 
these limitations could adversely affect us 
further  our ability to obtain international contracts is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar to foreign currencies 
we may incur unexpected liabilities associated with the stone webster and it group acquisitions  as well as other acquisitions 
in july  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of stone webster  inc  and during fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of the it group  inc we believe  pursuant to the terms of the agreements for the stone webster and it group asset acquisitions  that we assumed only certain liabilities  which we refer to as assumed liabilities  specified in those agreements 
in addition  those agreements provide that certain other liabilities  including but not limited to  certain outstanding borrowings  certain leases  certain contracts in process  completed contracts  claims or litigation that relate to acts or events occurring prior to the acquisition date  and certain employee benefit obligations are specifically excluded from our transactions 
we refer to these as excluded liabilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that we do not have any exposure related to the excluded liabilities 

table of contents in addition  some of the former owners of companies we have acquired are contractually required to indemnify us against liabilities related to the operation of their companies before we acquired them and for misrepresentations made by them in connection with the acquisitions 
in some cases  these former owners may not have the financial ability to meet their indemnification responsibilities 
if this occurs  we may incur unexpected liabilities 
any of these unexpected liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 
if we must write off a significant amount of intangible assets or long lived assets  our earnings will be negatively impacted 
because we have grown in part through acquisitions  goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill was approximately million as of august  if we make additional acquisitions  it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books 
we also have long lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets of million as of august   which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if a determination that a significant impairment in value of our unamortized intangible assets or long lived assets occurs  such determination would require us to write off a substantial portion of our assets 
such a write off would negatively affect our earnings 
difficulties integrating our acquisitions could adversely affect us 
from time to time  we have made acquisitions to pursue market opportunities  increase our existing capabilities and expand into new areas of operation 
we plan to pursue select acquisitions in the future 
if we are unable to complete acquisitions we have identified  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may encounter difficulties integrating our future acquisitions and in successfully managing the growth we expect from the acquisitions 
in addition  our expansion into new businesses  such as with our it group acquisition  may expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have traditionally experienced 
to the extent we encounter problems in identifying acquisition risks or integrating our acquisitions  we could be materially adversely affected 
because we may pursue acquisitions around the world and may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously  we may encounter unforeseen expenses  complications and delays  including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 
our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  including key officers  could have an adverse effect on us 
our ability to attract and retain qualified engineers  scientists and other professional personnel in accordance with our needs  either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  will be an important factor in determining our future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed professionals 
in addition  our ability to be successful depends in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled laborers and craftsmen in our pipe fabrication and construction businesses 
demand for these workers can at times be high and the supply extremely limited 
our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers 
the loss of any of our key officers could adversely affect us 
we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers 
changes in technology could adversely affect us  and our competitors may develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology 
we believe that we have a leading position in technologies for the design and construction of ethylene processing plants 
we protect our position through patent registrations  license restrictions and a research and development program 
however  it is possible that others may develop competing processes that could negatively affect our market position 
additionally  we have developed construction and energy generation and transmission software which we believe provide competitive advantages 
the advantages currently provided by this software could be at risk if competitors were to develop superior or comparable technologies 
our induction pipe bending technology and capabilities favorably influence our ability to compete successfully 
currently this technology and our proprietary software are not patented 
even though we have some legal protections against the dissemination of this know how  including non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  our efforts to prevent others from using our technology could be time consuming  expensive and ultimately may be unsuccessful or only partially successful 
finally  there is nothing to prevent our competitors from independently attempting to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 

table of contents if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our operating results could be harmed 
we devote significant attention to establishing and maintaining effective internal controls 
implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls if ever required may require specific compliance training of our directors  officers and employees  entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems  and take a significant period of time to complete 
we cannot be certain that these measures if ever required would ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting processes and related section reporting requirements if changes are made 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could affect our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in future periods 
ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the market price of our stock 
terrorists actions have and could continue to negatively impact the us economy and the markets in which we operate 
terrorist attacks  like those that occurred on september   have contributed to economic instability in the united states  and further acts of terrorism  violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate  our business and our expectations 
there can be no assurance that armed hostilities will not increase or that terrorist attacks  or responses from the united states  will not lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability in the united states 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers and could impact our domestic or international revenues  our supply chain  our production capability and our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and short term fixed rate investments 
we currently do not use any derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
the table below provides information about our future maturities of principal for outstanding debt instruments including capital leases and fair value at august  in millions expected maturity dates fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate short term line of credit variable rate average interest rate at august   the interest rate on our primary credit facility was with an availability of million see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our credit facility 
the estimated fair value of long term debt and capital leases as of august  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the convertible debt and senior notes as of august  was based on current market prices of such debt and based on the assumption that the recorded balances approximate fair value 

table of contents foreign currency risks the majority of our transactions are in us dollars  however  certain of our subsidiaries conduct their operations in various foreign currencies 
currently  when considered appropriate  we use hedging instruments to manage our risks associated with our operating activities when an operation enters into a transaction in a currency that is different from its local currency 
in these circumstances  we will frequently utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated purchases and or revenues 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching our revenues and expenses in the same currency for our contracts 
as of august   we had minimal forward exchange contracts outstanding that were hedges of certain commitments of foreign subsidiaries 
the exposure from the commitments is not material to our results of operations or financial position see notes and of our consolidated financial statements
