the results of operations of the company for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
the company negotiates all of its purchase orders with its foreign manufacturers in united states dollars 
thus  notwithstanding any fluctuations in foreign currencies  the company s cost for a purchase order is generally not subject to change after the time the order is placed 
however  the weakening of the united states dollar against local currencies could lead certain manufacturers to increase their united states dollar prices for products 
the company believes it would be able to compensate for any such price increase
