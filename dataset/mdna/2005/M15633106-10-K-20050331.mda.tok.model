item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified by  the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report  as well as the section on risk factors that is set forth below in this item in addition  this discussion contains forward looking statements and is  therefore  subject to the overall qualification on forward looking statements that appears at the beginning of this report 
we are in the mobility market and have a solution allowing users of enterprise web applications to synchronize those web applications down to pcs for use by individuals who are frequently disconnected from the network 
our enabling software is designed to integrate with web applications in a loosely coupled way that requires no changes in a company s enterprise web applications 
this approach has the potential to bring mobility to enterprise web applications quickly and with low total cost of ownership 
our products address the need of mobile users who are disconnected from a network to access and transact with critical enterprise web content and applications  such as sales tools  forecast management  contact lists  service repair guides  expense report updates  pricing data  time sheets  collaboration sessions  work orders  and other essential documents and information 
our products are designed to improve the productivity of mobile workforces and minimize the impact and costs on enterprise networks to support mobile users 
the backweb offline access server oas integrates with web applications in any technical framework  including portal frameworks  intranets  and websites  to extend the usefulness and function of the web applications to users who are remote with poor connectivity and users who are frequently disconnected from the network 
its two way synchronization capability enables field personnel to access content from  publish to and conduct transactions on web applications while disconnected  enabling the productive combination of fully featured enterprise applications used by mobile workers when they would otherwise be unable to interact with those applications 
our customers can offline enable their websites and portals without rewriting code  creating an offline end user experience that is essentially equal to being online 
the backweb polite sync server  formerly known as backweb foundation  uses network sensitive background content delivery that can deliver large amounts of data without impacting the performance of other network applications 
this allows organizations to efficiently target and deliver sizeable digital data to users desktops throughout the extended enterprise 
at the core of our products is our patented polite synchronization technology that is designed to distribute large amounts of data over narrow bandwidth connections while minimizing network costs 
we derive revenue from licensing our products and from maintenance  consulting and training services 
our products are marketed worldwide primarily through our direct sales force 
we also have generated revenue through business partners via our reseller and oem channels 
since  our direct sales force has accounted for a significant majority of our revenue 
while we expect our indirect channels to grow  we expect our direct sales efforts will continue to generate most of our revenue for the foreseeable future 

table of contents business overview during  we achieved some important strategic objectives around cost control and implementing new programs  including a revised sales process that we embarked upon in the first quarter of however  our results for the first three quarters of reflected continued challenges in information technology  or it  spending and the impact of the realignment of our sales process 
despite an increase in revenues during the fourth quarter compared with the first three quarters of  our total revenue decreased in compared with the primary driver behind the decrease was a decrease in our license revenue 
we believe the decrease in license revenue was primarily due to the lower than anticipated market demand to date for our backweb offline access server product  which has been due in part to the changes we implemented to our sales focus and strategy  in addition to a sluggish market recovery  particularly in the technology sector 
this decrease in revenues was partially offset by a increase in our services revenue compared to  primarily due to consulting revenue generated from our increased license sales during our operating expenses in declined approximately from due to the cost reductions discussed above 
as a result  we were able to reduce our net loss per share in by compared to recent events during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a change in our management structure to further reduce expenses and work towards the goal of profitability 
the focus of the management change was the reduction of management and administrative costs  and to a lesser extent  the reduction of the sales and marketing operation to a level consistent with our current sales 
as a result  we reduced our headcount by employees in various departments  including our chief executive officer and the chief financial officer 
backweb s product development  technical support and professional services operations experienced only modest reductions 
the goal of the changes was to improve our short and long term finances while continuing to invest in our product lines and to continue providing active support for our customers 
our total operating expenses in of million included accrual reversals of approximately million 
we expect that the restructurings  as well as other expense reduction measures  will result in annualized savings of approximately million  and expect the full impact of these reductions to be reflected beginning in the first quarter of backweb remains committed to its recently launched sales initiatives which focus on the ability to mobilize enterprise web applications used by business critical managers  field sales and field service personnel 
we expect that these actions  as well as other expense reduction measures  will result in annualized savings of approximately million  with the full impact of these reductions reflected beginning in the first quarter of near term outlook in  we believe that the recent demand for our off line solution coupled with the cost reduction measures implemented throughout could help us achieve our goal of becoming cash flow positive during critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

table of contents our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the trade receivable allowances for doubtful accounts  and accrued restructuring charges 
revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from software license fees  maintenance service fees  and consulting services paid to us directly by corporate customers and resellers and  to a lesser extent  from royalty fees from oems 
revenue derived from resellers is not recognized until the software is sold through to the end user 
royalty revenue is recognized when reported to us by the oem after delivery of the applicable products 
in addition  royalty revenue can arise from the right of oems and other distributors to use our products 
as described below  management estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue we recognize in any accounting period 
we recognize software license revenue in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition sop  as amended  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop 
sop requires that revenue be recognized under the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and no vsoe exists for the delivered elements 
under the residual method  any discounts in the arrangement are allocated to the delivered element 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop maintenance revenue included in these arrangements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance agreement 
the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements maintenance  training  and consulting services is determined based on the price charged for the undelivered element when sold separately 
revenue from software license agreements is recognized when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we do not generally grant a right of return to our customers 
when a right of return exists  we defer revenue until the right of return expires  at which time revenue is recognized provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we license our products on a perpetual and on a term basis 
we recognize license revenue arising from perpetual licenses and multi year term licenses in the accounting period that all revenue recognition criteria have been met  which is generally upon delivery of the software to the end user 
for term licenses with a contract period of less than two years  revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
at the time of each transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our license sale is fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in determining whether the fee is fixed or determinable  we compare the payment terms of the transaction to our normal payment terms 
we assess the likelihood of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history  the credit worthiness of the customer and  in some instances  a review of the customer s financial statements 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if credit worthiness cannot be established  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
service revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from standard maintenance agreements and consulting services 
customers licensing products generally purchase the standard annual maintenance agreement for the 
table of contents products 
we recognize revenue from maintenance over the contractual period of the maintenance agreement  which is generally one year 
maintenance is priced as a percentage of the license revenue 
for those agreements where the maintenance and license is quoted as one fee  we value the maintenance as an undelivered element at standard rates and recognize this revenue over the contractual maintenance period 
consulting services are billed at an agreed upon rate  plus out of pocket expenses 
we generally charge for our consulting services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenue from such services as they are provided to the customer 
we account for fixed fee service arrangements in a similar manner to an agreement containing an acceptance clause 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however if an acceptance provision exists  then we defer revenue recognition until we receive written acceptance of the product from the customer 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers and cash received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  including the allowance for doubtful accounts management continually reviews the collectibility of trade accounts receivable and the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts against the trade accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes customer accounts  account receivable aging reports  history of bad debts  the business or industry sector to which the customer belongs  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and any other pertinent factors 
generally  we make a provision for doubtful accounts when a trade receivable becomes days past due 
in exceptional cases  we will waive a provision after a trade receivable is days or more past due when  in the judgment of management  after conducting due diligence with the management of the customer  the receivable is still collectible and the customer has demonstrated that payment is imminent 
during  management s review of the allowance for doubtful accounts resulted in a write offs during the year of million related to past due accounts  primarily from amounts recorded in prior years 
management believes that it is able to make reasonably objective judgments on the adequacy of other provisions relating to trade accruals 
we have not made any provision for contingent liabilities which has involved significant management judgment that either we will prevail in the case of material litigation or that we have sufficient insurance to cover any adverse outcome 
a discussion of our outstanding material litigation is contained in part i  item legal proceedings of this form k 
accrued restructuring costs we have made decisions to provide for certain costs associated with corporate restructurings we believed were required in order to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
before a charge is executed  our executive management and board of directors approve the plan 
our restructuring plans executed in each of our last three fiscal years resulted in a reduction in headcount and the consolidation of facilities through the closing of excess field offices 
we reassess this liability each period based on market conditions 
revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions either change or do not materialize 
during  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan  and we recorded a charge of million 
in  we recorded a charge of million 
in the fourth quarter of  management reviews determined that an additional reserve of  was needed related to excess leased facilities that were part of the restructuring plan 
during the second quarter of  we settled a lease agreement related to our canadian subsidiary for approximately  this settlement was more favorable than had been originally accrued for  resulting in a decrease in restructuring expense of approximately  during the third quarter of  we determined that there would be no future cash requirements under the restructuring accrual  and reversed the accrual in full 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of approximately  related to the termination of employees throughout the company  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
all amounts related to this action were expensed in  and at december   there was an accrual of  related to severance and other payments yet to be distributed 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the results of operations  for the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of total revenue

the decrease in total revenue in was due to a million decrease in license revenue  partially offset by an increase in consulting service revenue of  the increase in total revenue in was due to a million increase in license fees and an increase in consulting fees of  compared to these increases were partially offset by a decrease in maintenance revenue of million 
the re positioning of our company during to focus on licensing our new oas product offering resulted in increased license and consulting revenue associated with this emerging product line  offset by decreases in maintenance revenue associated with our other product lines which were not strongly emphasized and marketed 
further discussion of the changes in the components of total revenue is included in the sections below 
we have limited visibility to forecast revenue for and therefore we are unable to quantify future overall trends in our total revenue 
however  in the sections below we discuss expected trends in the individual components of our total revenue and in our product revenue mix 

table of contents customers outside of the united states accounted for  and of our total revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the variations in the mix of revenue generated in the united states as compared to the revenue generated outside of the united states is partially due to the reduced number of deals closed in these periods  as each individual deal had a greater impact on the composition of our revenue and the significant variability in the value of these deals 
the overall decline in revenue generated outside of the united states was also attributable to more significant reductions in sales personnel and activities in europe relative to the united states 
cabc accounted for of our revenue in hewlett packard company accounted for approximately of our revenue in sap ag accounted for and hewlett packard company for of our revenue in we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future and revenue from one or more of these customers may represent more than of our total revenue in future years 
license revenue december  change change in thousands  except percentages license revenue as a percentage of total revenue license revenue decreased significantly in as compared to primarily due to a million decrease in license revenue generated from our oas product offering 
we released the oas product at the end of  and the demand that had been generated prior to its release led to increased license revenues in the first half of these revenues gradually decreased towards the end of  a trend that continued into as we realigned our sales team and management team 
this realignment included the hiring of a new vice president of sales who assumed responsibility for the sales organization in late march from erez lorber  our then ceo  who had been acting vice president of sales since his appointment as ceo in january additionally  we transitioned out several members of our direct sales team during these personnel changes were a result of our realignment of the skills within the sales team towards our new sales focus targeting line of business owners and reduced focus on targeting it department personnel 
we believe this transition of both personnel and sales strategy during contributed to the decrease in license revenue as new personnel were hired  trained  and assumed new customer and prospect lists from former personnel 
we believe this change within our sales execution model to be now complete  but will take some time before the full benefits of this change  if any  will be reflected in our operating results 
license revenue associated with our e accelerator and backweb polite synch server products also decreased approximately  or  largely due to the realignment of our sales and management teams as discussed above 
these decreases were partially offset by an  license of our source code to an existing customer in the first quarter of recognized ratably over the year 
license revenue increased significantly in primarily due to our re positioning during to focus on licensing our oas product offering and the subsequent demand upon the product s release 
in  license revenue associated with our oas product offering increased by approximately to approximately of license revenue 
license revenue associated with our e accelerator product decreased by approximately to approximately of license revenue  while license revenue from our backweb polite synch server product decreased by approximately to approximately of license revenue 
during we expect license revenue from our oas product offering to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of overall license revenue 
we expect to continue to generate license revenue from our older products  in particular the backweb polite synch server product  but we expect this to continue to decrease as a percentage of overall license revenue 

table of contents service revenue december  change change in thousands  except percentages service revenue as a percentage of total revenue service revenue consists of maintenance  consulting and training services 
the increase in service revenue in was primarily attributable to the consulting revenue generated from the increased license sales during generally we generate consulting revenues subsequent to selling licenses of our products 
in  this trend resulted in an increase of approximately  in service revenues 
as in  the vast majority of consulting revenue was related to the deployments of our oas product 
maintenance revenue in was relatively flat as compared to  as maintenance contracts related to new product sales replaced cancelled maintenance contracts related to our older product lines 
the decrease in service revenue in was attributable to a decrease in maintenance revenue associated with our backweb polite synch server and backweb e accelerator products 
overall  maintenance revenue decreased by million  or  as customers began terminating their maintenance agreements for these older products 
this development reflected our re positioning during to focus on licensing our new backweb offline access server and de emphasizing our older products  the relative age of a number of our customers installments utilizing our older products  and an overall trend in the it industry toward reducing maintenance obligations 
this decrease in maintenance revenue was partially offset by an increase of  or  in consulting revenue 
the vast majority of our consulting revenue was associated with increased customer deployments of our backweb oas product 
during we expect service revenue to remain relatively flat as compared to we expect that maintenance revenue associated with our older products will continue to decrease  offset by an increase in maintenance revenue associated with our oas product offering 
any increase in maintenance revenue from our oas product offering  however  is dependent upon an absolute dollar level increase in license revenue from that product  which cannot be assured 
further  while we expect consulting revenue to remain relatively consistent with the prior year  this too is dependent on increased licenses of our oas product offering 
cost of revenue december  change change in thousands  except percentages cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue cost of revenue remained relatively flat in as compared to both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  reflecting the cost reductions we implemented in prior years 
the decrease in cost of revenue in absolute dollars in was primarily due to the reduction in personnel  facilities  and associated general overhead within our support department as a result of organizational restructurings in and that significantly reduced personnel across our company 
in  the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was due to a shift in the revenue mix from having a majority of our revenue from lower gross margin service revenue to having a larger portion of our revenue from higher gross margin license revenue 

table of contents cost of license revenue cost of license revenue consists primarily of expenses related to media duplication  packaging of products  and royalty payables to oem vendors 
december  change change in thousands  except percentages cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue as a percentage of total revenue cost of license revenue decreased in absolute dollars in as compared to due to a decrease in the amount of media duplication required to distribute our products as well as a decrease in license revenue 
cost of license revenue decreased in absolute dollars in as compared to due to a shift in the license revenue mix away from products with higher royalties associated with them 
in  cost of license revenue was lower as a percentage of license revenue when compared to due to a decrease in revenue from third parties  including a decrease in revenue from products with higher royalties associated with them  resulting in a decrease in royalties payable 
during we expect our cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue to remain at approximately the same levels as cost of service revenue cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel and overhead related expenses of our customer support and professional service organizations  including related expenses of backweb consultants  third party consultants  and contractors 
december  change change in thousands  except percentages cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue as a percentage of total revenue the increase in absolute dollars of cost of service revenue in as compared to was primarily due to the increase in consulting services revenue  and the use of more senior consultants on our professional services engagements in the first quarter of  which increased the related cost of delivering the service revenue 
these increases were partially offset by a reduced level of payroll and related expenses together with a reduction in the associated overhead expenses that resulted from the reorganizations that occurred in october  october and july  and continuing cost containment and reduction programs applied throughout and the decrease in cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue in all periods presented was primarily a result of a reduction in infrastructure and overhead expenses associated with both our support and professional services departments  primarily stemming from the reorganization in october the decrease in absolute dollars of cost of service revenue in and was primarily due to the reduced level of payroll and related expenses together with a reduction in the associated overhead expenses that resulted from the reorganizations that occurred in october and july  and continuing cost containment and reduction programs applied throughout 
table of contents we expect cost of service revenue to increase marginally and remain relatively constant as a percentage of service revenue during operating expenses research and development research and development expenses consist of personnel  equipment and supply costs for our development efforts 
we charge these expenses to operations as they are incurred 
we have our research and development facilities in israel 
december  change change in thousands  except percentages research and development as a percentage of total revenue the decrease in research and development expenses during was primarily due to lower personnel and third party contractor costs and a reduction in associated travel and other related expenses 
during  we continued to reduce our headcount across all departments  including a reduction of full time employees in the research and development department from in to in the decrease in research and development expenses during was primarily due to lower personnel and third party contractor costs 
during  we realized a full year of savings resulting from the reorganization we implemented in october additionally  we significantly reduced our use of outside contractors and reduced headcount in our research and development department from to full time employees through attrition and personnel management 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is important in order to attain our strategic objectives 
however  we intend to continually monitor expenses across the organization and continually strive for cost reductions  particularly in light of the changes in personnel we implemented in october  in areas such as facilities  travel and entertainment  and telecommunications expenses 
as a result  we expect that research and development expenses will moderately decrease in terms of absolute dollars during sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force and our product management  marketing  business development  and operations management employees  together with the costs of marketing programs  including trade shows and other related direct expenses and general overhead

table of contents the decrease in sales and marketing expenses during resulted primarily from a reduction in personnel related costs  marketing programs  and facilities expenses 
sales and marketing expense decreased significantly as we realized the full effect of the reorganization we implemented in october and realized savings from additional personnel expense management 
we significantly reduced our marketing program expenses beginning in the latter half of and continuing throughout  resulting in savings of approximately  the closing of several sales and marketing offices in conjunction with the october reorganization resulted in a savings in of approximately  we consider maintaining a marketing presence and an effective sales organization to be vital to the achievement of our strategic objectives 
though we intend to continually monitor expenses across the organization and continually strive for cost reductions  we expect to selectively increase our sales organization when and where appropriate  particularly in connection with our realigned sales strategy 
in light of the changes in personnel implemented in october  we expect reduced expenses in the areas of facilities  travel and entertainment  and telecommunications expenses as well as personnel expenses and  thus  we expect sales and marketing expenses will decrease during general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs and outside services for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  general management  human resources  information services  and legal  as well as the provision for bad debts 
december  change change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative as a percentage of total revenue during  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a reduction in accounting and legal services  insurance costs and facilities expenses due in large part to the reorganization we implemented in october the reduction in accounting  legal and other outside service expenses was approximately million in as compared to primarily due to a change in our external accounting firm  a concerted effort to reduce legal expenses  and the discontinuation of the use of certain external consultants 
in addition  the restructuring and renegotiation of our insurance programs  particularly the rates related to our directors and officers insurance  resulted in savings in of approximately  as compared to these reductions were offset in part by an increase in expenses related to facilities and bad debt expense 
during  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a reduction in personnel and facilities expenses associated with the reorganization we implemented in october realizing the full effect of the reorganization in october resulted in a reduction of approximately  in payroll and related expenses 
in addition  the closing and consolidation of several offices in conjunction with the october reorganization resulted in a savings in of approximately  these reductions were partially offset by an increase in legal and other professional fees associated with our real estate holdings  securities litigation related to our initial public offering  expenses related to the liquidation of certain european entities  expenses related to being a public company  and various employee litigation matters 
we expect general and administrative expenses will decrease on an absolute basis over the next year due to realizing the full effects of reductions in personnel we implemented in october and a continued focus on cost reduction programs 

table of contents restructuring charges december  change change in thousands  except percentages restructuring and other charges as a percentage of total revenue during  we implemented a restructuring plan which included reducing our workforce by employees  vacating some facilities  canceling office service leases  and writing down fixed assets as a result of such employee terminations and office consolidation 
during the three month period ended september   we recorded a restructuring charge of million  which included million of severance and benefit costs  million of facility costs   related to the write down of fixed assets  and  related to other restructuring costs 
additionally  in november  we accrued a charge of approximately  of which approximately  related to the impairment of leased facilities in canada   related to a charge for settlement of leased space in san jose  california  and approximately  related to other office lease impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of approximately  related to the termination of employees throughout the company  including our chief executive officer and the chief financial officer 
all amounts related to this action were expensed in  and at december   there was an accrual of  related to severance and other payments yet to be distributed

write off of intellectual property and other intangible assets december  change change in thousands  except percentages write off of intellectual property and other intangible assets as a percentage of total revenue in conjunction with the restructuring we implemented during  we changed our internal allocation of resources 
as of june   we believed that it was unlikely that any future value would be realized from the wireless technology we acquired from mobix communications ltd 
this wireless technology had a carrying value of million as of june   which was in excess of its fair value of zero 
therefore  we wrote off the million remaining carrying value of these intangibles during amortization of intellectual property  other intangibles and deferred stock compensation december  change change in thousands  except percentages amortization of intellectual property  other intangibles and deferred stock compensation as a percentage of total revenue amortization of intellectual property  other intangible assets and deferred stock compensation consists of amortization of deferred stock compensation related to grants of stock options prior to our initial public offering of in and  and  in  and amortization of intellectual property and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of certain assets from mobix for approximately in and 
table of contents  and million in deferred stock compensation represents the aggregate differences between the respective exercise price of options at their dates of grant and the deemed fair market value of our ordinary shares for accounting purposes 
intellectual property and other intangibles are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  generally two to three years 
deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options based on an accelerated vesting method 
interest and other income  net december  change change in thousands  except percentages interest and other income  net as a percentage of total revenue interest and other income  net includes interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by interest expense and the effects of exchange gains and losses arising from the re measurement of transactions in foreign currencies 
the increase in interest and other income  net during as compared to was primarily due to an accrual reversal of  related to a provision for foreign taxes not expected to be remitted as of december  the decrease in interest and other income  net during was due to the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments due to our operating losses and reduced interest rates 
we expect interest and other income  net to continue to decrease slightly during as we anticipate we will continue to use cash during and  as a result  we expect to earn less investment and interest income 
write down of equity investments december  change change in thousands  except percentages write down of equity investments as a percentage of total revenue in  we invested in certain development stage companies operating internet centric businesses which we believed had a significant strategic interest 
due to the economic slowdown and the significant decline in capital available to  and in the valuations of  the privately funded internet centric businesses  management determined that one of our investments had become impaired 
accordingly  in  we recorded a charge of million to reflect impairment of this asset below its recorded cost to represent what management considered to be fair value 
no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended december  during september  we determined our one remaining investment was fully impaired primarily due to continuing difficulties in the economy  and recorded a charge for the full remaining carrying value of that investment  or million 
income taxes there is no provision for income taxes because we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we had approximately million of israeli net operating loss carry forwards and million and million of us federal and state net operating losses carry forwards  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
the us federal and state net operating loss carry forwards expire in varying amounts between the years and the israeli net operating loss carry forwards have no expiration date 

table of contents off balance sheet financings and liabilities off balance sheet arrangement we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
management evaluates estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees 
management considers such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss 
as of december   we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million as of december  net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  and was primarily used to fund our ongoing operational needs 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities reflects the restructuring that we implemented in  which resulted in significant headcount and other operational cost reductions throughout and cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  and primarily represents the net proceeds from the purchases and sales of short term investments to fund operational needs 
cash provided by financing activities was  and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares under our employee stock purchase plan  issuances related to the exercise of stock options and proceeds from shareholders notes receivable in in may  we entered into a million line of credit with silicon valley bank 
the amount of borrowings available under the line of credit is based on a formula using accounts receivable 
the line of credit has a stated maturity date of may  and provides that the lender may demand payment in full of the entire outstanding balance of the loan at any time 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the line requires that we meet certain financial covenants  provides payment penalties for noncompliance and prepayment  limits the amount of other debt we can incur  and limits the amount of spending on fixed assets 
during the third quarter of  we moved the  deposit related to our lease space in san jose  california under the line of credit 
at december   we had an unused borrowing capacity of million 
we expect to renew this line of credit but do not intend to draw further upon it in the near term 
as of december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products and the timing and extent of establishing additional operations 
as a result of the restructuring we implemented in october  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  we might need to raise additional funds prior to the expiration of this period to fund expansion  product development  acquisitions or working capital 
this need may arise sooner than we anticipate if our revenue does not grow in line with our expectations  particularly revenue from licensing our oas product  if our costs are higher than we expect or if we change our strategic plans 
if we were required to raise additional funds  it could be difficult to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all  due to our financial condition 
we may try to obtain additional financing by issuing ordinary shares or convertible debt securities  which would dilute our existing shareholders 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  respond to competitive pressures or grow our business  or we may be required to further reduce our expenditures  any of which could harm our business 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
we did not have long term debt obligations  capital lease obligations  or purchase obligations as of such date 
payments due by period less than after total year years years years operating lease obligations effective corporate tax rates our tax rate reflects a mix of the us statutory tax rate on our us income  european country tax rates on our individual european country income and the israeli tax rate discussed below 
we expect that most of our future taxable income will be generated in israel 
israeli companies are generally subject to corporate tax on their taxable income at a rate of in the tax year  in the tax year  in the tax year  and in and after the tax year 
however  as discussed below  the rate is effectively reduced for income derived from an approved enterprise 
the majority of our income  however  is derived from our capital investment program with approved enterprise status under the law for the encouragement of capital investments  and is eligible therefore for tax benefits 
as a result of these benefits  we expect to have a tax exemption on income derived during the first two years in which this investment program produces taxable income  provided that we do not distribute such income as a dividend  and a reduced tax rate of to for the following to years  depending upon the proportion of foreign ownership of backweb 
all of these tax benefits are subject to various conditions and restrictions 
see note income taxes israeli income taxes tax benefits under the law for the encouragement of capital investments   of notes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain approval for additional approved enterprise programs  or that the provisions of the law will not change 
since we have incurred tax losses through december   we have not yet used the tax benefits for which we are eligible 
see risk factors any future profitability may be diminished if tax benefits from the state of israel are reduced or withheld 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations most of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
however  we incur a large portion of our costs from our operations in israel 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses  primarily our research and development costs  are denominated in nis 
costs not denominated in us dollars are translated to us dollars when recorded  at prevailing rates of exchange 
this is done for the purposes of our financial statements and reporting 
costs not denominated in us dollars will increase if the rate of inflation exceeds the devaluation of the foreign currency as compared to the us dollar or if the timing of such devaluations lags considerably behind inflation 
consequently  we are  and will be  affected by changes in the prevailing exchange rate 
we might also be affected by the us dollar exchange rate to the major european currencies due to the fact that we do business in europe 
to date these fluctuations have not been material

if any of the risks described below occurs  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in such cases  the price of our ordinary shares could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
risks relating to our business we have a history of losses and we expect future losses 
since our inception  we have not achieved profitability and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred a net loss of approximately million in the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses through the remainder of and into as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability  and we may not be able to do so 
failure to achieve profitability or achieve and sustain the level of profitability expected by investors and securities analysts may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our business strategy requires that we derive a significant amount of license revenue from our oas product 
if demand for oas does not increase  our total revenue will not increase and our business will suffer 
our business strategy requires that we derive a significant amount of license revenue from licensing our oas product and derive additional related revenue through providing related consulting and maintenance services 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the demand for oas by future customers 
to date  we have not succeeded in generating significant revenue from licensing our oas product  which has negatively impacted our operating results 
if our competitors release products that are superior to oas in performance or price  oas is not widely accepted by the market  or we fail to enhance oas and introduce new versions in a timely manner  we may never generate significant license revenue from this product 
if demand for our oas product does not significantly increase  as a result of competition  technological change 
table of contents or other factors  it would significantly and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and operating results 
we have recently restructured our company  which could make it more difficult for us to achieve our business objectives or could result in further restructurings if we don t meet the goals of the restructuring 
in october  we restructured our company in order to reduce management and administrative costs and bring our sales and marketing operations in line with our current sales level 
while the restructuring has reduced cash operating expenses  our ability to adequately reduce cash used in operations  and ultimately generate profitable results from operations  depends upon successful execution of our business plan and obtaining new customers 
as a result of the reduction in personnel  however  we may not have sufficient resources to execute our refocused sales strategy  particularly with respect to our oas product  which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
in addition  we reorganized our management team in connection with the restructuring  including changing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
our new management team must work together effectively and in a timely manner in order for us to successfully execute our business strategy 
if we do not meet our restructuring objectives  we may have to implement additional restructuring plans  which could impact the long term viability of our company 
further  these plans may not achieve our desired goals due to such factors as significant costs or restrictions that may be imposed in some international locales on workforce reductions and a potential adverse affect on employee morale that could harm our efficiency and our ability to act quickly and effectively in the rapidly changing technology markets in which we sell our products 
the economic outlook has adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the demand for our current products and our results of operations 
despite recent signs of improvement  general economic indicators suggest continued uncertain economic conditions for the near future 
weak or uncertain economic conditions may continue to cause a reduction in or irregular information technology spending generally 
in addition  some of our customers continue to operate internet centric businesses  and these companies have been more acutely affected by uncertain economic conditions and have encountered significant difficulties in raising additional capital 
if our customers experience financial difficulties  it could have an adverse impact on the demand for our products  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  predictions regarding economic conditions have a low degree of certainty  and further predicting the effects of the changing economy is even more difficult 
we may not accurately gauge the effect of the general economy on our business 
as a result  we may not react to changing conditions in a timely manner  which could adversely impact our business and results of operations and cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 
our business is difficult to evaluate because our operating history is limited  and we have changed our strategic focus and repositioned our product line 
we have a limited operating history generally and an even more limited history operating our business in our current markets 
we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful 
we were incorporated on august   and did not begin generating revenue until december in early  we changed our strategic focus from a consumer oriented to an enterprise oriented internet communications company 
in  we again re positioned our products to focus on the portal market 
during  we expanded our market focus to include corporate intranets and other web based applications 
during  we realigned our sales strategy to focus on selling to the line of business owner as opposed to the it department 
these changes required us to adjust our business processes and make a number of significant personnel changes 
to date  we have only generated limited revenue from our new strategic focus  and we do not know if we will ever generate significant revenue from our new products 
to the extent we do not succeed in generating significant revenue from licensing our new products  particularly our oas product  our business  operating results and financial conditions will suffer 

table of contents we are increasingly relying on our direct sales force  rather than strategic relationships  for revenue generation and this trend could negatively affect our revenues 
until recently  we had expected revenue to be generated increasingly through or by our various strategic relationships and our business plans and budgets reflected such expectations 
however  in the year ended december   we did not generate significant revenue from our strategic reseller relationships 
we do not know if these existing or any future strategic partnerships will prove to be successful  or if we will derive material revenue from them 
moreover  these companies are constantly evaluating their product offerings and evaluating build or buy scenarios with respect to market offerings 
for example  we are aware that certain of our partners  such as ibm and sap  and potential resellers are actively evaluating and may be developing their own offline solutions that could be competitive with or replace our oas technology solution 
in addition  one or more of these companies may use the information they gain from their relationship with us to develop or market competing products 
such events would have an adverse impact on our revenue 
as a result  we are increasingly relying on our direct sales force  rather than strategic relationships  for sales of licenses to our new products 
if our direct sales force is not successful in these efforts  we may not achieve our business plans or attain our revenue goals 
if we require additional financing for our future capital needs but are not able to obtain it  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products  expand operations or respond to competitive pressures 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances have declined from million as of december  to million as of december   and we expect to continue to use cash in our operations for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we might need to raise additional capital to fund expansion  product development  acquisitions or working capital 
this need may arise sooner than we anticipate if our revenue does not grow in line with our expectations  particularly revenue from licensing our oas product  if our costs are higher than we expect or if we change our strategic plans 
if we were required to raise additional funds  it could be difficult to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all  due to our financial condition 
in the event that we obtain additional financing by issuing ordinary shares or securities that are convertible into ordinary shares  the interests of existing shareholders would be diluted 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  respond to competitive pressures or grow our business or we may be required to further reduce our expenditures  any of which could harm our business 
our long and unpredictable sales cycle depends on factors outside our control and may cause our license revenue to vary significantly 
to date  our average engagement with our customers have typically taken between and months for them to evaluate our products before making their purchasing decisions 
the long  and often unpredictable  sales and implementation cycles for our products have caused  and may continue to cause  our license revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
sales of licenses and implementation schedules are subject to a number of risks over which we have little or no control  including customer budgetary constraints  customer internal acceptance reviews  the success and continued internal support of customers own development efforts  the sales and implementation efforts of businesses with which we have relationships  the nature  size and specific needs of a customer and the possibility of cancellation of projects by customers 
along with our distributors  we spend significant time educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products with no guarantee that such investment will result in a sale 
in addition  our customers often begin by purchasing our products on a pilot basis before they decide whether or not to purchase additional licenses for full deployment 
for example  even after purchase  our customers tend to deploy our oas solution slowly  depending upon the skill set of the customer  the size of the deployment  the stage of the customer s deployment of a portal  the complexity of the customer s network environment and the quantity of hardware and the degree of hardware configuration necessary to deploy the products 

table of contents our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations 
our operating results are difficult to predict 
our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may  in the future  vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including demand for our products and services  internal budget constraints and the approval processes of our current and prospective customers  the timing and mix of revenue generated by product licenses and professional services  the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle  loss of customers  new product introductions or internal development efforts by competitors or partners  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  and economic conditions generally  as well as those specific to the internet and related industries 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a good indication of our future performance 
we incur expenses based predominantly on operating plans and estimates of future revenue 
our expenses are to a large extent fixed and we may not be able to adjust them quickly to meet a shortfall in revenue during any particular quarter 
any significant shortfall in revenue in relation to our expenses would decrease our net income or increase our operating losses and would also harm our financial condition 
in some recent quarters our operating results have been below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results may also be below such expectations  which would likely cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly license revenue typically depends on a small number of large orders  and any failure to complete one or more substantial license sales in a quarter could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we typically derive a significant portion of our license revenue in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders 
for example  for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our license revenue from a license to an existing customer 
our operating results for a particular fiscal quarter could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to complete one or more substantial license sales forecasted for that quarter 
additionally  we also offer volume based pricing  which may adversely affect our operating margins 
we typically have very little backlog and  accordingly  generate substantially all of our revenue for a given quarter in that quarter 
if we lose a major customer  our revenue could suffer because of our customer concentration 
we have historically generated a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers  and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  if we lose a major customer  or if there is a decline in the use of our products within our existing customers organizations  our revenue would be adversely affected 
in  our three largest customers represented approximately of our total revenue 
in  our three largest customers represented approximately of our total revenue 
in  our three largest customers represented approximately of our total revenue  with one oem customer  whose contract with us terminated in early  accounting for of our total revenue 
we signed a new reseller agreement with this customer  but the agreement does not require the customer to purchase any product from us 
in  we did not generate significant revenue from this reseller agreement  and we cannot assure you that we will derive revenue from this reseller agreement in the future 

table of contents we depend on increased business from new customers  as well as additional business from existing customers  and if we fail to grow our customer base or generate repeat business  our operating results could be harmed 
our business model generally depends on the sale of our products to new customers as well as expanded use of our products within our existing customers organizations 
if we fail to grow our customer base or to generate repeat and expanded business from our current and future customers  our business and operating results will be seriously harmed 
in some cases  our customers initially make a limited purchase of our products and services for trials  pilot or proof of concept programs 
these customers might not choose to acquire additional licenses to expand their use of our products 
in addition  as we have introduced new versions of our products or new products  such as our oas  we have experienced a decline in licensing revenue generated from our older products  such as polite sync server and e accelerator  and we anticipate future declines in licensing revenue from these products 
however  it is also possible that our current customers might not require the functionality of our new products and might not ultimately license these products 
because the total amount of maintenance and support fees we receive in any period depends  in large part  on the size and number of licenses that we have previously sold  any downturn in our software license revenue would negatively affect our future maintenance and support revenue 
in addition  if customers elect not to renew their maintenance agreements  our services revenue will decline significantly 
further  some of our customers are telecommunications or information technology companies  which have been forced to significantly reduce their operations in light of limited access to sources of financing and the national and global economic uncertainty 
if customers are unable to pay for their current products or are unwilling to purchase additional products  our revenue will decline  which would likely materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and stock price 
rapid technological changes could cause our products to become obsolete 
the internet communications market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
if we are unable to develop and introduce products or enhancements in a timely manner to meet these technological changes  we may not be able to successfully compete 
in addition  our products may become obsolete  in which event we may not remain a viable business 
our market is susceptible to rapid changes due to technology innovation  evolving industry standards  and frequent new service and product introductions 
new services and products based on new technologies or new industry standards expose us to risks of technical or product obsolescence 
for example  emerging technologies  such as wireless  that take a different approach to the challenge of offline web access by  for example  re engineering platforms and applications  pose a competitive challenge 
in addition  other companies  including some of our partners  also approach the issue of offline web architecture differently than we do in some cases  and such approaches may achieve a greater degree of market acceptance 
if we do not use leading technologies effectively  meet the challenges posed by emerging technologies or other architectures  continue to develop our technical expertise and enhance our existing products on a timely basis  we may be unable to compete successfully in this industry  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our inability to integrate our products with other third party software could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
our ability to compete successfully depends on the continued compatibility and interoperability of our products with products and systems sold by various third parties  such as portal framework vendors 
currently  these vendors have open applications program interfaces  which facilitate our ability to integrate with their systems 
these vendors have also been willing to license to us rights to build integrations to their products and use their development tools 
if any one of them were to close their programs interfaces or fail to grant us necessary licenses  our ability to provide a close integration of our products could become more difficult and could delay or prevent our products integration with future systems 

table of contents failure to successfully develop versions and updates of our products that run on the operating systems used by our current and prospective customers could reduce our sales 
many of our products run on the microsoft windows nt  microsoft windows or certain versions of the sun solaris unix operating systems  and some require the use of third party software 
any change to our customers operating systems could require us to modify our products and could cause us to delay product releases 
in addition  any decline in the market acceptance of these operating systems we support may require us to ensure that all of our products and services are compatible with other operating systems to meet the demands of our customers 
if potential customers do not want to use the microsoft or sun solaris operating systems we support  we will need to develop more products that run on other operating systems adopted by our customers 
if we cannot successfully develop these products in response to customer demands  our business could be adversely impacted 
the development of new products in response to these risks would require us to commit a substantial investment of resources  and we might not be able to develop or introduce new products on a timely or cost effective basis  or at all  which could lead potential customers to choose alternative products 
in addition  our products may face competition from operating system software providers  which may elect to incorporate similar technology into their own products 
competition in the internet communications market may reduce the demand for  or price of  our products 
the internet communications market is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
we expect that competition will intensify in the near term because there are very limited barriers to entry 
our primary long term competitors may not have entered the market yet because the internet communications market is relatively new 
competition could impact us through price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margin and loss of market share  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  longer operating histories  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations  sales  distribution and other resources than we do 
some of our potential competitors are among the largest and most well capitalized software companies in the world 
for example  both microsoft and ibm have announced product plans addressing the offline web application market segment served by our oas product 
if such companies enter this market segment  we may not be able to compete successfully  and competitive pressures may harm our business 
the loss of our right to use software licensed to us by third parties could harm our business 
we license technology that is incorporated into our products from third parties  including security and encryption software 
any interruption in the supply or support of any licensed software could disrupt our operations and delay our sales  unless and until we can replace the functionality provided by this licensed software 
because our products incorporate software developed and maintained by third parties  we depend on these third parties to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products  develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis and respond effectively to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
our growth may suffer because of the complexities involved in implementing our products 
the use of our products by our customers often requires implementation services  and our growth will be limited in the event we are unable to expand our implementation services personnel or subcontract these services to qualified third parties 
in addition  customers could delay product implementations 
in the second half of and in  there were a greater number of deployments of our oas solution by customers  and that solution is being subjected to actual commercial use and implementation 
initial implementation typically involves working with sophisticated software  computers and communications systems 
if we experience difficulties with implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner  we could be obligated to devote more customer support  engineering and other resources to a particular project at the expense of other projects 

table of contents our business will suffer if the internet infrastructure cannot support the demands placed on it 
our future revenue and profits  if any  depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium of business and communication by our customers 
rapid growth in the use of  and interest in  the internet has placed increased demands on its infrastructure 
our success will depend  in large part  on the acceptance of the internet in the commercial marketplace and on the ability of third parties to provide a reliable internet infrastructure network with the speed  data capacity  security and hardware necessary for reliable internet access and services 
to the extent that the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  increased frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it and the performance or reliability of the internet could suffer 
factors outside our control may cause the timing of our license revenue to vary from quarter to quarter  possibly adversely affecting our operating results 
we recognize license revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
if an arrangement requires acceptance testing or specialized professional services  recognition of the associated license and service revenue would be delayed 
the timing of the commencement and completion of these services is subject to factors that may be beyond our control  such as access to the customer s facilities and coordination with the customer s personnel after delivery of the software 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our professional services support for specialized features  our revenue recognition could be further delayed and our costs could increase  causing increased variability in our operating results 
if the economic slowdown continues  or if our revenue does not increase in the near future  we may have to implement additional plans in order to reduce our operating costs 
as a result of the economic slowdown  in the third quarter of and fourth quarter of we announced restructuring plans to reduce our operating costs to match the current business environment 
we also previously implemented a restructuring plan in july if the economic slowdown continues  or if our revenue does not increase from its current level  we may have to implement additional plans to reduce our operating costs  which could cause us to incur additional restructuring charges 
further  these plans may not achieve our desired goals due to such factors as significant costs or restrictions that may be imposed in some international locales on workforce reductions and a potential adverse affect on employee morale that could harm our efficiency and our ability to act quickly and effectively in the rapidly changing technology markets in which we sell our products 
we may experience tax liabilities in connection with the liquidation of wholly owned subsidiaries that have ceased trading 
as a result of the restructuring plans we announced on july  and september   we ceased commercial operations of the following subsidiaries backweb technologies bv  backweb technologies bv ltd  backweb technologies sarl  backweb technologies sarl  backweb canada inc  and backweb kk ltd 
we decided to liquidate these companies in order to further streamline our operations and to simplify our legal entity structure 
we cannot assure you that we will not have any termination liability issues with the appropriate tax authorities in each jurisdiction 
if such termination liability issues were to arise and we did not prevail  we might be required to pay significant taxes and penalties  which could adversely affect our cash balances and results of operations 
we may experience difficulties managing our expected growth and geographic dispersion 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and to implement our business plan in the rapidly evolving internet communications market requires an effective planning and management process 
these factors  together with our anticipated future operations and geographic dispersion  will continue to place a 
table of contents significant strain on our management systems and resources 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  and expand  train and manage our work force worldwide 
our international operations are subject to additional risks 
revenue from customers outside the united states represented approximately  or of our total revenue  for the year ended december   and million  or of our total revenue  for the year ended december  our international operations will continue to be subject to a number of risks  including  but not limited to laws and business practices favoring local competition  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection  import and export restrictions and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in investing in foreign operations at appropriate levels to compete effectively  and political and economic instability 
our international operations also face foreign currency related risks 
to date  substantially all of our revenue has been denominated in us dollars  but we believe that  in the future  an increasing portion of our revenue may be denominated in foreign currencies  including the euro and the british pound 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies may cause further volatility in our operating results  reduce the accuracy of our financial forecasts and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties  and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in license agreements with customers  consultants and vendors 
however  these parties could breach such confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts 
in addition  we have not signed confidentiality agreements in every case 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
we may not become aware of  or have adequate remedies in the event of  such breaches 
we pursue the registration of some of our trademarks and service marks in the united states and in certain other countries  but we have not secured registration of all our marks 
we license certain trademark rights to third parties 
such licensees may not abide by compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights and may take actions that would adversely affect our trademarks 
we do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  which are confidential when filed  with regard to potentially similar technologies 
we expect that software products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
although we believe that our products do not infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future 
the defense of any such claims would require us to incur substantial costs and would divert management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
if a party succeeded in making such a claim  we could 
table of contents be liable for substantial damages  as well as injunctive or equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to sell our products and services 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
our products may be used in an unintended and negative manner 
our products are used to transmit information through the internet 
a backweb customer could potentially use our products to transmit harmful applications  negative messages  unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted material  inaccurate data  or computer viruses to end users in the course of delivery 
any such transmission could damage our reputation or could give rise to legal claims against us 
we have received emails from certain of our customers end users claiming that our technology is a form of spyware  and we are actively engaged in challenging such accusations 
in the event such allegations result in litigation  we could spend a significant amount of time and money pursuing or defending legal claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not have sufficient insurance to cover all potential product liability and warranty claims 
our products are integrated into our customers networks 
the sale and support of our products may entail the risk of product liability or warranty claims based on damage to these networks 
in addition  the failure of our products to perform to customer expectations could give rise to warranty claims 
although we carry general commercial liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
our financial performance and workforce reductions may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new personnel 
in connection with the evolution of our business model and in order to reduce our cash expenses  we have adopted a number of changes in personnel  including significant workforce reductions 
the changes in personnel may adversely affect morale and our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
in addition  recent trading levels of our common stock have decreased the value of the stock options granted to employees pursuant to our stock option plan 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies they perceive to have better prospects 
if this were to occur  our revenue could decline and our operations in general could be impacted 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
our relationships with these officers and key employees are at will 
moreover  we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
legislation and regulatory changes may cause us to incur increased costs  limit our ability to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified officers and directors 
changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted by the sec and nasdaq  have required changes in some of our corporate governance and accounting practices 
we expect these laws  rules  and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more difficult  time consuming and costly 
the new rules could also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  particularly on our audit committee  or as executive officers 

table of contents risks relating to our location in israel any major developments in the political or economic conditions in israel could cause our business to suffer because we are incorporated in israel and have important facilities and resources located in israel 
we are incorporated under the laws of the state of israel 
our research and development facilities  as well as one of our executive offices  are located in israel 
although substantial portions of our sales are currently made to customers outside of israel  any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could significantly harm our business 
since september  a continuous armed conflict with the palestinian authority has been taking place 
we cannot predict the effect on backweb of an increase in the degree of violence in israel or of any possible military action elsewhere in the middle east 
we incur a large portion of our costs from operations in israel in nis 
if israel s economy is impaired by a high inflation rate or if the timing of the devaluation of the nis against the us dollar were to lag considerably behind inflation  our operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted to the extent that the inflation rate exceeds the rate of devaluation of the nis against the us dollar 
any future profitability may be diminished if tax benefits from the state of israel are reduced or withheld 
pursuant to the law for the encouragement of capital investments  the israeli government has granted approved enterprise status to our existing capital investment programs 
consequently  we are eligible for tax benefits for the first several years in which we generate taxable income 
our future profitability may be diminished if all or portions of these tax benefits are reduced or eliminated 
these tax benefits may be cancelled if we fail to comply with requisite conditions and criteria 
currently the most significant conditions that we must continue to meet include making specified investments in fixed assets  financing at least of these investments through the issuance of capital stock  and maintaining the development and production nature of our facilities 
in addition  the law and regulations prescribing the benefits provide for an expiration date for the grant of new benefits 
the expiration date has been extended several times in the past 
the expiration date currently is june   and no new benefits will be granted after that date unless the expiration date is extended 
we cannot assure you that new benefits will be available after june  or that the benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level 
israeli regulations may limit our ability to engage in research and development and export our products 
under israeli law  we are required to obtain an israeli government license to engage in research and development and the export of the encryption technology incorporated in our products 
our current government license to engage in these activities expires in april our research and development activities in israel  together with our ability to export our products out of israel  would be limited if the israeli government revokes our current license  our current license is not renewed  our license fails to cover the scope of the technology in our products  or israeli law regarding research and development or export of encryption technologies were to change 
israeli courts might not enforce judgments rendered outside of israel that may make it difficult to collect on judgments rendered against us 
some of our directors and executive officers are not residents of the united states and some of their assets and our assets are located outside the united states 
service of process upon these directors and executive officers  and enforcement of judgments obtained in the united states against us  and these directors and executive officers  may be difficult to obtain within the united states 
backweb technologies  inc  our us subsidiary  is the us agent authorized to receive service of process in any action against us in any federal or state court arising out of our initial public offering or any related purchase or sale of securities 
we have not given consent for this agent to accept service of process in connection with any other claim 
we have been informed by our legal counsel in israel  naschitz  brandes co  that there is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under us securities laws in original actions instituted in israel 
however  
table of contents subject to certain time limitations  an israeli court may declare a foreign civil judgment enforceable if it finds that the judgment was rendered by a court that was  according to the laws of the state of the court  competent to render the judgment  the judgment is no longer able to be appealed  the obligation imposed by the judgment is enforceable according to the rules relating to the enforceability of judgments in israel and the substance of the judgment is not contrary to public policy  and the judgment is executory in the state in which it was given 
even if the above conditions are satisfied  an israeli court will not enforce a foreign judgment if it was given in a state whose laws do not provide for the enforcement of judgments of israeli courts subject to exceptional cases or if its enforcement is likely to prejudice the sovereignty or security of the state of israel 
an israeli court also will not declare a foreign judgment enforceable if the judgment was obtained by fraud  there was no due process  the judgment was rendered by a court not competent to render it according to the laws of private international law in israel  the judgment is at variance with another judgment that was given in the same matter between the same parties and which is still valid  or at the time the action was brought in the foreign court a suit in the same matter and between the same parties was pending before a court or tribunal in israel 
if a foreign judgment is enforced by an israeli court  it generally will be payable in nis  which can then be converted into non israeli currency and transferred out of israel 
the usual practice in an action to recover an amount in non israeli currency is for the israeli court to render judgment for the equivalent amount in nis at the rate of exchange on the date of payment  but the judgment debtor also may make payment in non israeli currency 
pending collection  the amount of the judgment of an israeli court stated in nis ordinarily will be linked to the israel consumer price index plus interest at the annual rate set by israeli law prevailing at that time 
judgment creditors bear the risk of unfavorable exchange rates 
we have adopted anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent an acquisition of backweb  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
provisions of israel corporate and tax law and of our articles of association  such as our staggered board  may have the effect of delaying  preventing or making more difficult a merger or other acquisition of backweb  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
israeli corporate law regulates acquisitions of shares through tender offers  requires special approvals for transactions involving significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions 
furthermore  israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions unappealing to us or to some of our shareholders 
in addition  our articles of association provide for a staggered board of directors 
the new tax reform in israel may reduce our tax benefit  which might adversely affect our profitability 
on january   a comprehensive tax reform took effect in israel 
we performed an analysis of the likely implications of the new tax reform legislation on our results of operations 
our evaluation concluded that the impact of the tax reform on both our corporate and income tax framework would not have a material effect on our results and operations 
this evaluation was based  in part  on the assumptions that we would not expand beyond the countries in which we already operate and that we would remain in a net operating loss for tax 
table of contents purposes for at least the next three years 
we cannot assure you that these assumptions will be met  and the tax reform will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
our results of operations may be negatively affected by the obligation of key personnel to perform military service 
certain of our officers and employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
although we have operated effectively under these requirements since our inception  we cannot predict the effect these obligations will have on us in the future 
our operations could be disrupted by the absence  for a significant period  of one or more of our officers or key employees due to military service 
such military requirement could be increased in the event of war or military action involving israel 
risks relating to our ordinary shares our stock price has been volatile and could fluctuate in the future 
the market price of our ordinary shares has been volatile 
we expect our stock price to continue to fluctuate in response to quarterly variations in operating results  in response to announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors or partners  because of market conditions in the enterprise software or portal industry  in reaction to changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and our failure to meet or exceed the expectations of analysts or investors  in response to our announcements of strategic relationships or joint ventures  and in response to sales of our ordinary shares 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we are currently subject to a securities class action described in part i  item legal proceedings of this annual report  and the volatility of our stock price could make us a target for additional suits 
securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
our stock is listed on the nasdaq smallcap market and our continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market listing is not assured 
effective on september   we transferred the listing of our ordinary shares from the nasdaq national market system and began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we will remain eligible to be quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market  subject to our compliance with the applicable continued listing requirements which require  among other things  that i we have shareholders equity of million  ii we have  in net income  or iii the market value of our publicly held shares be million or more 
at december   we met these listing requirements 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the continued listing requirements  and  as a result  may be delisted from trading on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if our ordinary shares are delisted from trading on the nasdaq smallcap market  then the trading market for our ordinary shares  and the ability of our shareholders to trade our shares and obtain liquidity for their shares  may be significantly impaired and the market price of our ordinary shares may decline significantly 

table of contents holders of our ordinary shares who are united states residents face income tax risks 
we believe that we will be classified as a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for us federal income tax purposes 
our treatment as a pfic could result in a reduction in the after tax return to the holders of our ordinary shares and may cause a reduction in the value of such shares 
for us federal income tax purposes  we will be classified as a pfic for any taxable year in which either i or more of our gross income is passive income  or ii at least of the average value of all of our assets for the taxable year produce or are held for the production of passive income 
for this purpose  cash is considered to be an asset  which produces passive income 
passive income also includes dividends  interest  royalties  rents  annuities and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets  which produce passive income 
as a result of our cash position and the decline in the value of our stock  we might be considered a pfic under a literal application of the asset test that looks solely to market value 
if we are a pfic for us federal income tax purposes  holders of our ordinary shares who are residents of the united states us holders would be required  in certain circumstances  to pay an interest charge together with tax calculated at maximum rates on certain excess distributions  including any gain on the sale of ordinary shares 
the consequences described above can be mitigated if the us holder makes an election to treat us as a qualified electing fund  or qef 
a shareholder making the qef election is required for each taxable year to include in income a pro rata share of the net capital gain of the qef as long term capital gain  subject to a separate election to defer payment of taxes  which deferral is subject to an interest charge 
we have agreed to supply us holders with the information needed to report income and gain pursuant to a qef election 
the qef election is made on a shareholder by shareholder basis and can be revoked only with the consent of the internal revenue service  or irs 
as an alternative to making the qef election  the us holder of pfic stock which is publicly traded could mitigate the consequences of the pfic rules by electing to mark the stock to market annually  recognizing as ordinary income or loss each year an amount equal to the difference as of the close of the taxable year between the fair market value of the pfic stock and the us holder s adjusted tax basis in the pfic stock 
losses would be allowed only to the extent of net mark to market gain previously included by the us holder under the election for prior taxable years 
all us holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers about the pfic rules generally and about the advisability  procedures and timing of their making any of the available tax elections  including the qef or mark to market elections 
our officers  directors and affiliated entities own a large percentage of backweb and could significantly influence the outcome of actions 
our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them  in the aggregate  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding ordinary shares as of december  these shareholders  if acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in israel and sell them in the us  canada  europe and israel 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as most of our sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
as a result  the company does not anticipate material losses in these areas 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure
