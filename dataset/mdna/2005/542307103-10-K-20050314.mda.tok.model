restatement of prior financial information dollars in thousands following a review of accounting adjustments cited in filings with th e securities and exchange commission by a number of restaurant companies i n december  and after discussions with the company s independent auditors ernst young llp  the company determined that certain items related to it s accounting for property leases were inappropriate 
as a result  the company ha s restated its consolidated financial statements for fiscal and all prio r year periods presented 
the company has corrected its computation of straight line rent expense an d the related deferred rent liability 
historically  when accounting for lease s with renewal options  rent expense was recorded on a straight line basis ove r the initial non cancelable lease term 
building and leasehold costs an d improvements for those properties were amortized on the straight line metho d over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the expected ter m of the lease  including option renewal periods 
the company has determined tha t it should recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected ter m of the lease  including cancelable option periods when failure to exercise suc h options would result in an economic penalty to the company 
in addition  th e company determined that in a few instances the leasehold amortization perio d being used was greater than the expected lease term 
as a result of the above  the company has restated its financial statement s to recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease ter m including cancelable lease renewal option periods when failure to exercise suc h options would result in an economic penalty 
in addition  the restatemen t includes an adjustment to depreciation expense to correct the depreciable live s being used for certain leasehold cost and improvements where the contractua l term of the lease was shorter than the historical depreciation period previousl y used to record depreciation expense 
the restatement is further discussed in note restatement of prio r financial information see notes to consolidated financial statements and i n item selected financial data included in this form k 
the cumulative effect of the restatement through fiscal is an increas e in long term liabilities of  an increase of deferred tax assets o f  an increase in accumulated depreciation of  and a decrease i n retained earnings of  the restatement decreased reported net income b y and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the restatement did no t have any impact on the company s previously reported cash position  cash flow s or revenues 
critical accounting policies dollars in thousands the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require th e company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported i n the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto see note to th e consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significan t accounting policies  the following represent accounting policies that ma y involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
impairment of long lived assets underperforming restaurants and definite lif e intangibles property and equipment and definite life intangibles are reviewe d for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carryin g amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company reviews applicabl e intangible assets and long lived assets related to each restaurant on a periodi c basis 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may not b e recoverable  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result fro m the use of the asset 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flow s is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized the impairment loss is recognized by measuring the difference between th e carrying value of the assets and the fair market value of the assets 
th e company s estimates of fair values are based on the best information availabl e and require the use of estimates  judgments  and projections as considere d necessary 
the actual results may vary significantly 
impairment of long lived assets goodwill and indefinite life intangible s goodwill and certain intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives which ar e not subject to amortization are subjected to an annual impairment test  or mor e frequent tests if indicators of impairment exist 
in assessing recoverability o f goodwill  the company may be required to make assumptions regarding estimate d future cash flow and other factors to determine the fair value 
the amount o f fair value for certain intangible assets having indefinite lives are made b y reference to recent market transactions 
an impairment loss is recognized whe n the estimates of fair value are less than the carrying value of the assets 
self insurance reserves beginning in fiscal  the company adopte d self insurance programs for its worker s compensation  general liability  an d medical benefits programs 
in order to minimize the exposure under th e self insurance programs  the company has purchased stop loss coverage both on a per occurrence and on an aggregate basis 
the self insured losses under th e programs are accrued based upon the company s estimate of the ultimate expecte d liability for both claims incurred and on an incurred but not reported basis the establishment of such accruals for self insurance involve certain managemen t judgments and assumptions regarding the frequency or severity of claims  th e historical patterns of claim development and the company s experience with clai m reserve management and settlement practices 
to the extent actual results ma y differ from the assumptions used to develop the accrual estimate amounts  suc h unanticipated changes may produce significantly different amounts of expens e than those estimated under the self insurance program 
income taxes deferred income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities ar e recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount s of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used fo r income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance i f it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asse t will not be realized 
the company reviews the recoverability of any deferred ta x assets reflected in the balance sheet and provides any necessary allowances a s required 
any adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income i n the period such determination was made

impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations includ e food and labor costs 
a number of the company s restaurant personnel are paid a t the federal and state established minimum wage levels and  accordingly  change s in such wage levels affect the company s labor costs 
however  since th e majority of personnel are tipped employees  minimum wage changes generally hav e little effect on overall labor costs 
historically  as costs of food and labo r have increased  the company has been able to offset these increases through men u price increases and economies of scale  however  there may be delays in th e implementation of such menu price increases or in effecting timely economies o f scale  as well as  competitive pressures which may limit the company s abilit y to recover any cost increases in their entirety 
historically  inflation has no t had a material impact on operating margins 
during fiscal  the compan y experienced significant volatility in beef prices as such prices for the yea r were generally above historical levels 
to the extent that beef prices continu e to be significantly above historical levels  it will have a material negativ e impact on operating margins

risk factors changing consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns  potentia l outbreaks of mad cow disease or foot mouth disease and other factor s affecting the availability of beef could force us to modify our restaurants concept and menu and could result in a reduction in our revenues 
even if we are able to successfully compete with other restaurant companie s with similar concepts  we may be forced to make changes in one or more of ou r concepts in order to respond to changes in consumer tastes or dining patterns consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumptio n of beef  the primary item on our menus  or by specific events such as th e recently confirmed cases of mad cow disease by the canadian government o r foot mouth disease which occurred in the united kingdom 
in addition  thes e events could reduce the available supply of beef or significantly raise th e price of beef 
if we change a restaurant concept  we may lose additiona l customers who do not prefer the new concept and menu  and we may not be able t o attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make th e restaurant profitable 
in addition  we may have different or additiona l competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a concept change an d may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors 
our succes s also depends on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions  the cost of gasoline  disposable consumer incom e and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce gues t traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could reduc e revenues and operating income 
unforeseen cost increases could adversely affect our profitability 
our profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor and othe r operating costs 
during fiscal  our beef prices were generally abov e historical levels 
to the extent that beef prices continue to be significantl y above historical levels  it will have a material negative effect on operatin g margins 
in addition  our dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh foo d supplies means that shortages or interruptions in supply could materially an d adversely affect our operations 
moreover  unfavorable trends or development s concerning the following factors could adversely affect our results o inflation  food  labor  energy and utilities and employee benefit costs and o rent increases resulting from rent escalation provisions in our leases 
we may be unable to anticipate or react to changing prices 
if we ar e unable to modify our purchasing practices or quickly or readily pass o n increased costs to customers  our business could be materially affected 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors  we will not b e able to increase revenues or generate profits 
our inability to increas e revenues is directly related to our ability to compete effectively with ou r competitors 
key competitive factors include o the quality and numbers of employees needed to adequately staff ou r restaurants  o the quality and value of the food products offered  o the quality of service  o the cost of our raw products  o the price of the food products offered  o the restaurant locations  and o the ambiance of facilities 
we compete with other steakhouse restaurants specifically and with al l other restaurants generally 
we compete with national and regional chains  a s well as individually owned restaurants 
the restaurant industry has fe w non economic barriers to entry  and as our competitors expand operations competition from steakhouse restaurants with concepts similar to ours can b e expected to intensify 
many of our competitors are well established in th e upscale and mid scale steak segments and certain competitors have substantiall y greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
such increase d competition could adversely affect our revenues 
failure to comply with government regulations could adversely affect ou r operating performance 
our restaurant operations are subject to certain federal  state and loca l laws and government regulations  such as o obtaining of licenses for the sale of food and alcohol beverages  o national and local health sanitation laws and regulations  o national and local employment and safety laws and regulations  and o local zoning  building code and land use regulations 
while we have never experienced any significant difficulties in obtainin g necessary governmental approvals  the failure to obtain or retain food an d liquor licenses or any other governmental approvals could have a materia l adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be subjected to dram shop liability  which generally provides a person injured by an intoxicated person with the right to recover damages fro m an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicate d person 
although we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensiv e general liability insurance  if we lost a lawsuit related to this liability  ou r business could be materially harmed 
the restaurant industry is affected by a number of trends  as well as b y competition 
the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes and b y national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
th e performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such as traffi c patterns  demographic considerations and the type  number and location o f competing restaurants 
in addition  factors such as inflation  increased food labor and employee benefit costs and the availability of experienced managemen t and hourly employees to successfully operate the restaurants may also adversel y affect the restaurant industry in general and our restaurants in particular 
consumer perceptions of food safety could adversely affect our business our business could be adversely affected by consumer perceptions of foo d safety in the united states or in the market areas in which we operate  whethe r such perceptions are based on fact or not 
in addition  adverse publicit y resulting from poor food quality  illness  injury or other health concerns a t one or a limited number of our restaurants could have a material adverse effec t on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business depends on a limited number of key personnel  the loss of who m could adversely affect us 
some of our senior executives are important to our success because the y have been instrumental in setting the strategic direction of our company operating our business  identifying  recruiting and training key personnel identifying areas for expansion and arranging necessary financing 
these ke y personnel include jamie b 
coulter  our chief executive officer  td o connell our president of lone star restaurants  and certain of our other executiv e officers 
although we believe there is a significant pool of talented personne l in the restaurant industry  if these members of our senior management tea m become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  it coul d adversely affect our business and development 
shareholders may not be able to resell their stock or may have to sell at a price substantially lower than the price they paid for it 
the trading price for our common stock has been highly volatile and coul d continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations i n our quarterly operating results  general conditions in the restaurant industr y or the general economy  and other factors 
in addition  the stock market i s subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for publi c companies generally  or within broad industry groups  which fluctuations may b e unrelated to the operating results or other circumstances of a particula r company 
such fluctuations may adversely affect the liquidity of our commo n stock  as well as the price that holders may achieve for their shares upon an y future sale 
staggered board  blank check preferred stock 
our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for thre e classes of directors to be elected on a staggered basis 
this enables existin g directors to exercise significant control over our affairs  and may act as a n impediment to any future attempts by third parties to take control of our boar d of directors 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority withou t further action by the stockholders to issue shares of preferred stock in one o r more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restriction s thereof 
the exercise of this authority may act as a further impediment to an y future attempts by third parties to take control of our board of directors 
a single vendor distributes most of our consumable products 
approximately of the consumable products used in our restaurants ar e distributed through and delivered by a single vendor 
while we believe we coul d replace this vendor  any disruption of services by this vendor or any change t o a new vendor could adversely affect our restaurants 
the risk of future terrorist attacks may adversely impact our revenue 
as a result of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september  a number of our restaurants  particularly our del frisco s and sullivan s restaurants  were negatively affected 
additionally  recent terrorist warnings both in the united states and internationally  suggest the possibility of futur e terrorist attacks  which together with the unpredictability of future militar y action and other responses to such terrorist attacks has resulted in economi c uncertainty 
the occurrence of future terrorist attacks may adversely affect ou r business and make it more difficult to forecast our future results of operation item a
