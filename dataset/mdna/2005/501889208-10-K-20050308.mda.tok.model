item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the repair of automobiles includes the purchase of automotive replacement parts 
buyers of replacement parts have the option to purchase from primarily three sources new parts produced by original equipment manufacturers  which are commonly known as oem parts  new parts produced by companies other than the oem s  sometimes referred to generically as aftermarket parts  and recycled parts originally produced by oem s  which we refer to as recycled oem products 
we have historically sold primarily recycled oem products 
in  we expanded our product lines to include aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts 
we believe that this expansion of our product offerings will allow us to fill more of our customers requests 
since our formation in  we have grown through both internal development and acquisitions 
for the first months of our existence  we focused on growth through acquisitions 
our acquisition strategy has been to target companies with strong management teams  a record of environmental compliance  solid growth prospects and a reputation for quality and customer service 
internal growth is an important driver of our revenue and operating results 
since  we have focused primarily on growing our recycled product sales and operating results within our existing organization 
we have done so by developing our regional distribution networks and by creating overnight product transfers between our facilities to better leverage our inventory investment and to increase our ability to fill customer demand 
our revenue  cost of goods sold and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
factors that may affect our operating results include  but are not limited to fluctuations in the pricing of new oem replacement parts  the availability and cost of inventory  variations in vehicle accident rates  increasing competition in the automotive parts industry  changes in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business changes in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process  our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully  fluctuations in fuel prices  changes in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business  operations and infrastructure  and declines in the value of our assets 
due to the foregoing factors  our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate 
accordingly  our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance 
sources of revenue our revenue from the sale of automotive replacement products and related services has typically ranged between and of our total revenue 
we sell the majority of our automotive replacement products to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops 
our automotive replacement products include  for example  engines  transmissions  front ends  doors  trunk lids  bumpers  hoods  fenders  grilles  valances  headlights and taillights 
we sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products 
these contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for periods of six months  one year or two years 
we defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts 
the demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors  including the number of vehicles in operation  the number of miles being driven  the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents  availability and pricing of new parts  seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions 
additionally  automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process 
accordingly  we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products 
we provide insurance companies services that include the review of vehicle repair order estimates  as well as direct quotation services to their adjusters 
there is no standard price for recycled oem products  but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability  quality  demand  new oem replacement part prices and the age of the vehicle being repaired 
the pricing for aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts is determined based on a number of factors  including availability  quality  demand  new oem replacement part prices and competitor pricing 
approximately to of our revenue is obtained from other sources 
these include bulk sales to mechanical remanufacturers and scrap sales 
when we obtain mechanical products from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged or when we have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type  we sell them in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers 
the majority of these products are sorted by product type and model type 
examples of such products are engine blocks and heads  transmissions  starters  alternators  and air conditioner compressors 
after we have recovered all the products we intend to resell  the remaining materials are crushed and sold to scrap processors 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for recycled oem products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle  as well as auction fees and storage  and towing  where applicable 
our cost of goods sold also includes other costs such as labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles 
our labor and labor related costs related to buying and dismantling account for approximately of our salvage cost of goods sold 
the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and  as a result  energy costs are not material 
our cost of goods sold for aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts includes the price we pay for the parts  freight and other inventoried costs such as labor and other costs to acquire  including import fees and duties  where applicable 
our aftermarket collision automotive replacement parts are acquired from a number of vendors located primarily overseas  with the majority of our overseas vendors located in taiwan 
in the event we do not have a recycled replacement part or suitable aftermarket replacement part in our inventory  we attempt to purchase the part from a competitor 
we refer to these parts acquired as brokered parts 
the revenue from products that we obtain from third party recyclers to sell to our customers ranges from to of our total revenue 
the gross margin on brokered product sales as a percentage of revenue is generally less than half of what we achieve from sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these products 
some of our mechanical products are sold with a standard six month warranty against defects 
we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses 
our warranty expense is approximately of our total cost of goods sold 
our warranty reserve activity during was as follows balance as of december   warranty expense  warranty claims  balance as of december   we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products 
the expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made 
expenses our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our processing  redistribution  self service and warehouse facilities 
these costs include labor for both plant management and facility and warehouse personnel  facility rent  property and liability insurance  utilities and other occupancy costs 
our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to deliver our products to our customers 
included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers  local delivery and transfer truck rentals and subcontractor costs  vehicle repairs and maintenance  insurance and fuel 
our selling and marketing expenses primarily include our advertising  promotion and marketing costs  salary and commission expenses for sales personnel  sales training  telephone and other communication expenses  and bad debt expense 
personnel costs account for approximately to of our selling and marketing expenses 
most of our wholesale recycled sales personnel are paid on a commission basis 
the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers needs and increase our sales volume 
we are continually evaluating our sales force  developing and implementing training programs  and utilizing appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 
our general and administrative expenses include primarily the costs of our corporate and regional offices that provide corporate and field management  treasury  accounting  legal  payroll  business development  human resources and information systems functions 
seasonality our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors  influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns 
during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products 
in addition  the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition  warranty costs  inventory valuation  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill impairments  self insurance programs  contingencies  asset impairments and taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize and report revenue from the sale of automotive replacement products when they are shipped and title has transferred  subject to a reserve for returns  discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information 
a repair product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment 
discounts may be earned based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment 
allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment 
we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products 
revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 
warranty reserves we issue a standard six month warranty against defects on some of our mechanical products 
we record an accrual for standard warranty claims at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses 
we analyze historical warranty claim activity by referencing the claims made and aging them from the original product sale date 
we use this information to project future warranty claims on actual products sold that are still under warranty at the end of an accounting period 
a increase in our historical annual warranty claims would result in an additional annual expense of approximately  inventory accounting salvage inventory 
salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle  and includes buying  dismantling and  where applicable  auction fees and storage  and towing 
inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility s inventory at expected selling prices 
the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility s historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements 
aftermarket inventory 
aftermarket inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
our aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for parts  and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying  where applicable 
for items purchased from foreign companies  import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included 
for all inventory  our inventory carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand for our products 
if actual demand differs from our estimates  additional reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable and our historical experience 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was approximately million  which represents of gross receivables 
if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our allowance for doubtful accounts may be insufficient to cover the uncollectible receivables  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 
a change in the annual write off rate would result in a change in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is limited because we have a large number of small customers that are generally geographically dispersed 
we control credit risk through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring policies 
we also have certain customers that pay for products at the time of delivery 
goodwill impairment we record goodwill as a result of our acquisitions 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we refer to as sfas  that requires us to analyze our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the determination of the value of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events may indicate that an impairment exists 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
we utilize outside professionals in the valuation industry to validate the assumptions and overall methodology used to determine the fair value estimates used in our goodwill impairment testing 
as of december   we had million in goodwill that will be subject to future impairment tests 
if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments in future periods  we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results 
we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of  and  respectively 
a decrease in the fair value estimates used in the fourth quarter of impairment test would not have changed this determination 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if our review indicates that the carrying value of long lived assets is not recoverable  we reduce the carrying amount of the assets to fair value 
we have had no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets in or self insurance programs we self insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program 
we also self insure a portion of automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
we have purchased stop loss insurance coverage that limits our exposure to both individual claims as well as our overall claims 
the cost of the stop loss insurance is expensed over the contract periods 
we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits  automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims 
if actual claims are higher than what we anticipated  our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period 
if we were to incur claims up to our aggregate stop loss insurance coverage during the open policy years  we would have an additional expense of approximately million in contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business resulting from litigation  claims and other commitments and from a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we determine the amount of reserves  if any  with the assistance of our outside legal counsel 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted 
if the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued  the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period that the loss occurred 
if the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be probable  the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included in our operating results in the period such determination was made 
accounting for income taxes all income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and we determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions 
in the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions 
such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
although we have recorded all probable income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  these accruals represent estimates that are subject to the inherent uncertainties associated with the tax audit process  and therefore include contingencies 
we record a provision for taxes based upon our expected annual effective income tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical taxable income  expectations and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we had a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  against our deferred tax assets 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
subsequently revised in december consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties 
fin was effective for all variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities for periods ended after december  application for all other types of entities was required in financial statements for periods ended after march  we reviewed the interpretation and determined that it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amended and clarified financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas was effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  we adopted the new standard and determined that its implementation did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and was effective for periods ending on or after june  we adopted the new standard and determined that its implementation did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage must be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact sfas will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  a revision of sfas sfas r requires the adoption of a fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim fiscal period that begins after june  we are currently assessing the impact that sfas r will have on our results of operations  but we expect that it will negatively impact such results for by approximately million or per diluted share 
we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or cash flows 
acquisitions during  we acquired three automotive recycling businesses located in upstate new york  california and nevada  respectively  for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  million in notes issued and  redeemable shares of our common stock 
the business combinations enabled us to serve new market areas 
in the first quarter of  we completed three acquisitions two in the recycled oem automotive parts business and one in the aftermarket automotive parts business for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  million in notes issued and  shares of our common stock 
these acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets  become a significant provider of aftermarket automotive replacement parts and become a provider of self service retail automotive parts 
in the second quarter of  we completed two acquisitions in the recycled oem automotive parts business  one with operations in guatemala and costa rica and one located outside minneapolis  for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  million in notes issued and  shares of our common stock 
the revenue of the central american businesses is not material  but we intend to use these facilities as a future platform to sell certain types of products into central america from our us based recycled oem automotive replacement parts facilities 
much of this product is currently being disposed of as scrap or mechanical core product by our us facilities 
the minneapolis acquisition represents our establishment of production and warehousing capabilities in that market 
in late october  we completed an acquisition of related companies with seven primary locations in the northwestern united states  including three retail self service facilities  for an aggregate of approximately million in cash 
this acquisition enables us to expand our presence in that region 
in the first quarter of  we completed an acquisition in the aftermarket automotive replacement parts business with two locations  near philadelphia and washington  dc  for approximately million in cash 
this acquisition enables us to expand our presence in these areas of the country 
segment reporting over of our operations are conducted in the united states 
during  we acquired a recycled oem automotive parts business with locations in guatemala and costa rica 
revenue generated and properties located outside of the united states are not material 
we manage our operations geographically 
our automotive replacement parts operations are organized into seven operating segments  six for recycled automotive replacement products and one for aftermarket automotive replacement products 
these segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services  customers and methods of distribution 
the automotive replacement parts operations account for over of our revenue  earnings and assets

our revenue increased  from million in to million in the increase in revenue is primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold and business acquisitions 
organic revenue growth was approximately in we have continued to expand our services to the insured repair industry and added local delivery routes and transfer routes that helped us to increase our market penetration 
the revenue attributable to the six business acquisitions completed in accounted for approximately million of total revenue for the year 
cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold increased  from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods sold increased from to 
the increase in cost of goods sold is primarily due to increased volume of products sold 
the increase in cost of goods sold percentage was due primarily to a change in inventory mix to higher end salvage during the third quarter and lower recovery on our shipping and handling costs 
gross margin 
our gross margin increased  from million in to million in our gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased from to 
our gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased due primarily to the factors noted above in cost of goods sold 
we shifted our buying in the fourth quarter to a lower average cost vehicle than we were purchasing earlier in the year and are refocusing our sales force to recoup more of our shipping and handling costs through higher billings for these items 
as a result  we saw our gross margin improve in the fourth quarter compared to our third quarter 
facility and warehouse expenses 
facility and warehouse expenses increased  from million in to million in our acquisitions accounted for million of the increase in facility and warehouse expenses 
our remaining facility and warehouse expenses increased primarily from higher wages due to increased headcount and higher repairs and maintenance expenses 
this increase was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense for field personnel and lower rent expense due to our exercise of purchase options on certain production facilities that we previously leased 
as a percentage of revenue  facility and warehouse expenses decreased from to 
distribution expenses 
distribution expenses increased  from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue our distribution expenses increased from to 
our acquisitions accounted for million of the increase in distribution expenses 
our remaining distribution expenses increased as we have increased the number of local delivery trucks by approximately 
we also operated more daily transfer routes between our facilities due to the increase in parts volume 
for the year ended december  we increased the amount of product we moved between our facilities by approximately  the majority of which was on our own transfer trucks 
in addition  higher wages primarily from an increase in the number of employees  and increased fuel costs  truck rentals and repairs  delivery supplies  contracted salvage transfer services and freight costs accounted for the remaining growth in distribution expenses 
we renegotiated our freight rates with substantially all of our common carriers in the fourth quarter of  and we directed our sales force to recoup more of our shipping and handling costs 
we expect to slow the increase in our distribution costs as a percentage of revenue in future quarters 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million in to million in our acquisitions accounted for million of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the majority of the remaining expense increase was due to labor and labor related expenses and costs associated with being a public company  partially offset by million in lower incentive compensation  lower bad debt expenses of million and by improved insurance and legal claims experience of million 
our selling expenses tend to rise as revenue increases due to our wholesale recycled commissioned inside sales force

we use corporate owned life insurance policies to fund our obligations under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan 
net interest expense decreased to million in from million in in  interest expense was related primarily to debt incurred to fund acquisitions 
included in interest expense in is million in debt issuance costs that were written off 
these costs were attributable to our previous secured bank credit facility that was terminated in february see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of changes in our bank credit facilities 
the decrease in net interest expense is due to both lower average debt levels and interest rates in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased  from million in to million in due primarily to improved operating results 
our effective tax rate was in and in the decrease in our effective income tax rate in was due primarily to the receipt of nontaxable life insurance proceeds of million in the fourth quarter

our revenue increased  from million in to million in the increase in revenue was primarily due to the higher volume of products we sold 
we continued to expand our services to the insured repair industry and added local delivery routes and transfer routes that helped us to increase our market penetration 
we increased the number of customers we serve by approximately 
we also completed three business acquisitions during the first quarter of the revenue attributable to these business acquisitions accounted for approximately million of total revenue for the year

gross margin 
our gross margin increased  from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased from to 
our gross margin increased primarily due to increased volume 
the increase in gross margin percentage was due primarily to higher revenue growth in certain markets that have historically had higher gross margins as a percentage of revenue and our improving costs of salvage in certain regional operations 
facility and warehouse expenses 
facility and warehouse expenses increased  from million in to million in the increase in facilities and warehouse expenses was due primarily to higher wages from an increase in the number of employees  and higher costs of employee insurance  repairs and maintenance  and property insurance 
we had several large employee medical claims in that increased our self insured costs 
repairs and maintenance has increased as our volumes have increased 
property insurance rates were considerably higher in as a percentage of revenue  facility and warehouse expenses decreased from to 
distribution expenses 
distribution expenses increased  from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  distribution expenses increased from to 
we increased the number of transfer routes by approximately and local delivery trucks by approximately in in addition  higher wages from an increase in the number of employees  increased fuel  freight and vehicle insurance costs  and higher employee medical claims accounted for a portion of the growth in distribution expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million in to million in the majority of the expense increase was due to labor and labor related expenses 
our selling expenses tend to be more variable in nature due to our commissioned inside sales force 
in addition  costs in that were higher than in were due primarily to higher levels of salaried outside sales staff  increased advertising and promotion activities and additional other incentive compensation expense 
finally  we incurred approximately million in higher premiums for directors and officers liability insurance and higher accounting fees and other costs in connection with becoming a public company in the fourth quarter of as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from to

net other expense decreased  from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  net other expense decreased from to 
net interest expense decreased  from million in to million in the decrease was the result of both lower debts levels and interest rates in  as well as higher debt issuance costs in from our previous credit facility that expired in june we paid down our bank debt with the proceeds from our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of other income decreased million due primarily to the favorable settlement of a claim in relating to an acquisition that was completed in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased  from million in to million in due to improved operating results 
our effective income tax rate was for and for liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are our cash flow from operations and our credit facility 
at december   we had cash and equivalents amounting to million  and we had million outstanding under our million unsecured bank credit facility 
our credit facility was utilized to finance our january acquisition of an automotive aftermarket replacement parts business for approximately million 
at the time of this acquisition we increased the total capacity of our bank credit facility to million from million 
based on our current plans  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities for and believe that cash flow from operating activities and availability under our bank credit facility will be adequate to fund our short term liquidity needs 
as of march   debt outstanding under our credit facility totaled approximately million 
our liquidity needs are primarily to fund working capital requirements and expand our facilities and network 
the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds 
we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles 
we acquired approximately  and  wholesale salvage vehicles in the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
we also acquired approximately  additional salvage vehicles for our self service retail operations during the fiscal year ended december  our purchases of aftermarket replacement parts totaled million in we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of redistribution centers and processing facilities and through selected business acquisitions 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts  the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in cash was provided by net income adjusted for non cash items 
working capital uses of cash included increases in receivables and inventory  plus decreases in accounts payable and other noncurrent liabilities  partially offset by decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets  plus increases in accrued expenses  income taxes payable and deferred revenue 
receivables increased due to our increased sales volumes and increases of million for employee relocation loans 
inventory increased to support our increased volume 
accounts payable decreased as we accelerated payments to certain foreign vendors in order to realize improved pricing on certain aftermarket product purchases and also due to the timing of payments for certain facility construction projects and information systems licenses 
other noncurrent liabilities decreased primarily due to reductions in legal claim reserves partially offset by an increase in employee deferred compensation liabilities 
prepaid expenses and other assets decreased due primarily to amortization of directors and officers liability insurance partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation plan assets and cash paid in connection with the exercise of a warrant  net of decreases in that investment s value subsequent to acquisition 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to increases in our self insurance reserves  property taxes  and timing of wage payments 
income taxes payable increased due primarily to our higher levels of taxable income 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to higher sales of extended warranty contracts 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  compared to million in we invested million of cash in six acquisitions in compared to million in three acquisitions in  while net property and equipment purchases increased million  due primarily to exercises of purchase options on previously leased facilities and investments in facility expansions and information systems 
we also exercised a warrant and paid an exercise price of million in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this investment 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  compared to million in included in these net cash amounts are million in from the exercises of stock options and warrants and million in from the sale of shares in our initial public offering and exercises of stock options and warrants 
in addition  we borrowed million under our bank credit facility in primarily to fund acquisitions  compared to net repayments of million in repayments of long term debt obligations increased million in we also used million in for debt issuance costs related to our new unsecured credit facility compared to million in in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in cash was provided by net income adjusted for non cash items 
working capital uses of cash included an increase in receivables and prepaid expenses and other assets  partially offset by decreases in inventory and increases in payables  deferred revenue and other operating liabilities 
prepaid expenses and other assets increased primarily due to increases in annual insurance premiums  increases in annual maintenance contracts for information systems hardware  deferred costs incurred with respect to business acquisitions completed in early and an increase in prepaid income taxes that was refunded or applied against our estimated tax payments 
the increase in receivables and payables is consistent with our increased business activity 
our inventory decreased primarily due to a greater number of inventory turns 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to higher sales of extended warranty contracts 
other noncurrent liabilities increased primarily due to increases in employee deferred compensation liabilities

in order to make any borrowing under the revolving credit facility  after giving effect to any such borrowing  we must be in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility  including  without limitation  a senior debt to ebitda ratio which cannot exceed to 
the revolving credit facility contains customary covenants  including  among other things  limitations on our payment of cash dividends  restrictions on our payment of other dividends and on purchases  redemptions and acquisitions of our stock  limitations on additional indebtedness  certain limitations on acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  and the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
the interest rate on advances under the revolving credit facility may be  at our option  either the bank prime lending rate  on the one hand  or the interbank offering rate ibor plus an additional percentage ranging from 
to  on the other hand 
the percentage added to ibor is dependent upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio for the trailing four quarters 
on january   we increased our unsecured credit facility availability with our bank group from million to million 
in addition  we amended the credit facility to provide for the option to further increase the facility from million to million  with the funding increase subject to approval from the banks 
we may in the future borrow additional amounts under our revolving credit facility or enter into new or additional borrowing arrangements 
we anticipate that any proceeds from such new or additional borrowing arrangements will be used for general corporate purposes  including to develop and acquire businesses and redistribution facilities  to expand and improve existing facilities  to purchase property  equipment and inventory  and for working capital 
during august  as required by our bank credit facility  we entered into a two year interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of million and a fixed rate of 
the counterparty to the agreement was a member of our bank group 
this swap agreement expired on august  under the terms of the agreement  we were required to make quarterly payments at the specified fixed rate and in return received payments at variable rates 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap was a loss of million at december   and is included in other noncurrent liabilities and accrued expenses 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are included in current period earnings  as the agreement had not been designated as a hedging instrument 
in february  we repurchased  shares of our common stock from existing stockholders  including  shares repurchased from autonation  inc  our largest stockholder at the time  for a total of million in cash 
we partially funded the stock repurchase by obtaining a million term loan  which originally had a maturity date of february  on october   we fully paid the balance on the term loan 
on february   in connection with a business acquisition  we issued two promissory notes totaling million 
the annual interest rate on the notes is and interest is payable upon maturity 
the first million note was paid on february  and the second million note was paid on march  in may  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock from existing stockholders  including  shares repurchased from autonation  inc  for a total of million in cash 
the company partially funded the stock repurchase by borrowing an additional million against an existing revolving credit facility

we expect to use these funds for asset replacements  completion of two new facilities  systems development projects and to expand current facilities 
as of march   debt under our credit facility totaled approximately million 
we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for will be between million and million 
we believe that our current cash and equivalents  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements 
however  we may  from time to time  raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  or refinancing of our current credit facility  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements and future commitments we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to item of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended

risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
our business is also subject to the risks that many other companies face  such as general economic conditions and geopolitical events 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
in such an event  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks relating to our business we face intense competition from local  national and internet based automotive products providers  and this competition could negatively affect our business 
the automotive replacement parts industry is highly competitive and is served by numerous suppliers of oem parts  recycled parts and aftermarket parts 
within each of these categories of suppliers of automotive replacement parts  there are local owner operated companies  larger regional suppliers  national providers  and internet based suppliers 
providers of automotive replacement parts that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such parts may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of automotive replacement parts  which may further increase the competition we face 
some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise  greater financial  technical  manufacturing  distribution and other resources  longer operating histories  lower cost structures  and better relationships in the insurance and automotive repair industries 
in certain regions of the united states  local automotive recycling companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in the recycled parts industry 
as a result of these factors  our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply  to provide their products at lower costs  or to supply parts to customers unavailable to us 
an adverse change in our relationships with auction companies or our suppliers could increase our expenses and hurt our relationships with our customers 
most of our salvage inventory consists of vehicles offered at salvage auctions by several companies that own auction facilities in numerous locations across the united states 
we do not have contracts with any auction companies 
according to industry analysts  three companies control over of the salvage auction market in the united states 
in some localities  the automotive auction business may be even more highly concentrated 
if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions  or significantly raised its fees  our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 
moreover  auction companies have begun to allow bids to be submitted on salvage vehicles through the internet  which increases the number of potential bidders and may increase our cost of goods sold for recycled automotive replacement parts 
we also acquire some of our inventory directly from insurance companies  original equipment manufacturers  aftermarket parts manufacturers and others 
to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements  our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers 
in addition  we purchase aftermarket parts primarily from foreign manufacturers in taiwan 
in the event that our business relationships with these suppliers deteriorated or terminated or in the event that the importing of products into the united states from taiwan or the exporting of products by taiwan to the united states was disrupted  our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting inability to service our customers 
we may not be able to sell our products due to existing or new laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the sale of recycled or aftermarket automotive products 
some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled automotive products that we provide  such as airbags 
these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled automotive parts 
restrictions on the products we are able to sell could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations 
we became involved in the aftermarket automotive parts business upon the closing of an acquisition in february since  legislatures in a majority of states have introduced or considered bills that would prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket automotive parts in collision repair work and or require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent before using aftermarket automotive parts 
additional bills of this kind may be introduced in the future 
if a number of states adopt legislation prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket automotive parts  it could have a material adverse impact on our aftermarket replacement parts business 
certain organizations test the quality and safety of automotive replacement parts 
in the event that such organizations decide that a particular automotive part does not meet applicable quality or safety standards  we may decide to discontinue sales of such part or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such part 
such events could adversely affect our business 
in  a us congressman requested that the general accounting office gao review the role of the national highway traffic safety administration in regulating the safety and quality of aftermarket replacement automotive parts 
the gao released its report in january this report may lead to congressional hearings and possible future federal legislation  which could adversely impact our aftermarket replacement parts business 
if our business relationships with insurance companies end  we may lose important sales opportunities 
we rely on business relationships with certain insurance companies 
these insurance companies encourage automotive repair facilities to use products we provide 
because we do not have written agreements with these companies  these relationships may terminate at any time 
we rely on these relationships for sales to some collision repair shops  and a termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing  among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground  air  or water  the exposure to hazardous materials  and the generation  handling  storage  use  treatment  identification  transportation and disposal of industrial by products  waste water  storm water and hazardous materials 
we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations 
if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
we could also become liable if employees or other third parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials 
under certain environmental laws  we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at  or migrating to or from  our or our predecessors past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of  or was not responsible for  the release of such hazardous substances 
environmental laws are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws  and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances may adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits 
our operating subsidiaries must receive certain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations 
when we develop or acquire a new facility  we must seek the approval of state and local units of government 
governmental agencies often resist the establishment of an automotive recycling facility in their communities 
there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold 
proposed regulations under the national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system could harm our business 
in  congress enacted the anti car theft act to deter trafficking in stolen vehicles 
this law included the establishment of the national stolen passenger motor vehicle information system to track and monitor stolen automotive parts 
in april  the department of justice published for comment proposed regulations to implement this system 
the proposed regulations require  among other things  that insurance companies  salvagers  dismantlers  recyclers and repairers inspect salvage vehicles for the purpose of collecting the vehicle identification number and the part number for any covered major part that possesses the vehicle identification number 
the requirement to collect this information would place burdens and costs on us that otherwise would not normally exist  and could discourage our customers from purchasing our products 
we could be subject to product liability claims 
if customers of repair shops that purchase our products are injured or suffer property damage  we could be subject to product liability claims 
the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
we may lose business if recent litigation involving the use of parts that are not original equipment manufacturer parts results in insurance companies modifying arrangements affecting the use of recycled or aftermarket automotive products in the repair process 
as a result of litigation against an insurance company for using parts manufactured by companies other than the original equipment manufacturer  some insurance companies have curtailed or eliminated their requirement that repair shops use automotive parts that are not oem parts 
although our products are primarily recycled oem parts  we entered the aftermarket parts business through an acquisition in february in addition  litigation or restrictive insurance company repair policies could be extended to limit the use of recycled oem parts 
in an illinois lawsuit involving state farm mutual automobile insurance company avery v 
state farm  a jury decided in october that state farm breached certain insurance contracts with its policyholders by using non oem parts to repair damaged vehicles when use of such parts did not restore the vehicle to its pre loss condition 
the jury found that state farm misled its customers by not disclosing the use of non oem parts and the alleged inferiority of those parts 
the jury assessed damages against state farm of million  and the judge assessed an additional million of disgorgement and punitive damages for violations of the illinois consumer fraud act 
in april  the illinois appellate court upheld the verdict but reduced the damage award by million because of duplicative damage awards 
in october  the illinois supreme court agreed to hear the case  but no decision has yet been rendered 
some insurance companies have reduced or eliminated their use of aftermarket parts as a result of this case 
we sell primarily recycled oem automotive products as well as aftermarket automotive repair parts to repair shops affiliated with insurance companies and these repair shops are an important source of revenue for us 
the recycled oem products we sell were not the subject of avery v 
state farm  but our financial results would suffer if insurance companies modified or terminated the arrangements pursuant to which repair shops buy recycled automotive products from us due to a fear of similar claims with respect to recycled products 
moreover  in the event that the avery v 
state farm case is upheld by the illinois supreme court  the demand for our aftermarket parts could be further reduced 
we may not be able to successfully acquire new operations or integrate future acquisitions  which could cause our business to suffer 
we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons 
future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing  and such additional financing  whether sought through public or private debt or equity financing  may not be available when needed or may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we buy a company or a division of a company  we may experience difficulty integrating that company or division s personnel and operations  which could negatively affect our operating results 
in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us  we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning  treasury management and financial reporting  we may be held liable for environmental risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions  some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence  our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention  and we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated 
in connection with future acquisitions  we may assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire 
these liabilities  including liabilities for environmental related costs  could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition  the issuance of which would involve restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
our existing credit facility imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and requires us to meet certain financial tests 
our credit facility contains certain operating and financial restrictions that limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions  including the following incurring or guarantying additional debt  paying dividends or other distributions to our stockholders or redeeming  repurchasing or retiring our capital stock or subordinated obligations  making investments and capital expenditures  creating liens on our assets  selling  transferring  leasing  licensing or otherwise disposing of assets  engaging in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  engaging in mergers  consolidations or acquisitions  engaging in any material line of business substantially different from  or unrelated to  those lines of business currently carried on by us  and making changes to our equity capital structure or amending our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  or any stockholder rights agreement 
the credit facility requires that we satisfy certain financial tests 
the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit facility 
we expect that a default  if not waived  could result in acceleration of our debt  in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable 
if this occurs  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if new financing were available  it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing facility or it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
our future capital needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding that  if not available  could cause our business to suffer 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future to  among other things  fund our existing operations  to improve or expand our operations  to respond to competitive pressures or to make acquisitions 
from time to time  we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic alliances or other arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests  and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to further limitations on our operations 
if we fail to raise capital when needed  our business will be negatively affected 
our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 
our revenue  cost of salvage vehicles and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
future factors that may affect our operating results include  but are not limited to  the following fluctuations in the pricing of new oem replacement parts  the availability and cost of inventory  variations in vehicle accident rates  increasing competition in the automotive parts industry  changes in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business  changes in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process  our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully  fluctuations in fuel prices  changes in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business  operations and infrastructure  and declines in the values of our assets 
due to the foregoing factors  our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate 
accordingly  our results of operations may not be indicative of future performance 
these fluctuations in our operating results may cause our results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
if we lose our key management personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 
our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees  or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 
if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level  we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel  which could harm our business 
if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks  our business could be harmed 
we use a fleet of trucks to deliver the majority of the vehicle parts we sell 
we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services  including inclement weather  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  availability and price of fuel  and liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance 
in addition  our failure to deliver parts in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks relating to our common stock our executive officers  directors  and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders 
as of december   our executive officers  directors  and their affiliates  in the aggregate  beneficially owned approximately of our common stock 
if they were to act together  these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders  including the election of directors  any amendments to our certificate of incorporation  and certain significant corporate transactions 
these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other stockholders 
in addition  without the consent of these stockholders  we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that may be viewed as beneficial to us or our other stockholders 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
we and our stockholders may sell shares of common stock in the future 
we may also issue shares of common stock in connection with future acquisitions 
certain of our existing stockholders are parties to a registration rights agreement that provides such holders with the right to require us to effect the registration of their shares of common stock in specific circumstances 
in addition  if we propose to register any of our common stock under the securities act of  whether for our own account or otherwise  some existing stockholders may be entitled to include their shares of common stock in that registration 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect  if any  that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the value of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued in connection with an acquisition  or the perception that such sales could occur  may cause the value of our common stock to fall 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover  which could affect the value of our stock 
the anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could  together or separately  impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions that could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by stockholders to change management more difficult 
our incorporation under delaware law and these provisions could also impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquiror from making a tender offer for our common stock  which  under certain circumstances  could reduce the value of our common stock 
related party transactions we have entered into a number of related party transactions that we believe are on terms no less favorable to us than we otherwise could have obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
for a description of these transactions  please see the information appearing under the caption certain transactions in the proxy statement  which information is incorporated herein by reference

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility  where interest rates are tied to either the prime rate or ibor 
as of december  we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
our previous secured credit facility required that we enter into an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate our interest rate risk on a portion of the balance outstanding 
we do not however  as a matter of policy  enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the swap agreement  which expired on august   had a notional amount of million under which we paid a fixed rate of interest of and received payments based upon variable rates 
the swap agreement was not designated as a hedging instrument and  as a result  changes in the fair value of the swap agreement were included in current period earnings 
we recorded non cash credits of  and  during and  respectively  related to the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement 
based upon our variable rate debt at december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately million 
the company is also exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket parts in taiwan 
while all transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars  changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket parts 
we might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers 
under our present policies  we do not attempt to hedge this currency exchange rate exposure 
our investment in our central american operations is not material  and we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related to such operations
