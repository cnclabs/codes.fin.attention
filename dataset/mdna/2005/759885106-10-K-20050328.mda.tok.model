item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth above under the caption business risk factors 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements for the year ended december  and the related notes appearing in part ii item of this report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing drugs to treat neurological diseases and disorders 
we were incorporated in delaware in january we currently focus our research and development programs in the areas of neuroprotection  pain and neuroinflammatory diseases 
our most advanced product candidate cerovive nxy  is a novel free radical trapping neuroprotectant in development for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
in may  our exclusive licensee  astrazeneca  commenced two phase iii clinical trials saint i and ii with cerovive nxy to determine its effect on disability and neurological recovery in acute ischemic stroke patients 
in august  astrazeneca initiated a phase ii trial chant to assess safety and tolerability of cerovive nxy in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage 
in december  we announced that patient enrollment in the saint i trial  one of the two phase iii trials with cerovive nxy  had been completed 
we expect to announce top line results from the saint i trial in coordination with astrazeneca during the second quarter of enrollment of patients in the saint ii and chant trials with cerovive nxy is proceeding consistent with astrazeneca s announced goal of seeking regulatory approval in astrazeneca is responsible for funding and conducting all of the clinical trials with cerovive nxy 
in addition to cerovive nxy  we are independently conducting clinical trials with two other product candidates 
ren  an oral drug candidate for neuropathic pain  is currently in a phase ii clinical trial for sciatica that we began in and ren  an oral drug candidate for multiple sclerosis  is currently in a phase ia clinical trial that we commenced in february in july  we announced our decision to discontinue efforts to commercialize ren  an intravenous drug candidate that we were developing for the treatment of acute post operative pain 
in march  we announced our decision to discontinue development of ren in post herpetic neuralgia phn 
in addition to our clinical programs  we are conducting preclinical research and development activities in the areas of neuroprotection and pain to identify future product candidates for clinical development 
previously  we were also conducting research in the area of neuroinflammation which led to the advancement of ren into clinical development 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we continue the development and prepare for commercialization of ren and ren  expand our research and development programs  and advance new product candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs 
in addition  we may acquire or in license technology and products and may also acquire or invest in businesses that are complementary to our own 
we have a limited history of operations 
since our inception we have generated all of our revenues from agreements with corporate partners 
during  we recorded million in contract revenue related to milestone payments that we received from astrazeneca following their receipt of regulatory approval to commence phase iii trials for cerovive nxy 
upon achievement of certain future milestones involving the filing and approval of marketing applications in the us and us or japan  astrazeneca is obligated to make additional payments to us totaling up to million 
upon commercialization of cerovive nxy  we are entitled to receive mid teen percentage royalties on worldwide net sales from astrazeneca 

table of contents on december  we entered into a collaborative research  development and license agreement with genentech under which we received an upfront payment of million 
we have deferred the upfront payment and are recognizing it as contract revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated research period of two years 
accordingly  we recognized million related to this agreement during the year ended december  we expect to recognize the remaining deferred revenue  million  as contract revenue during the agreement with genentech also provides for future milestones and royalties in connection with the development and commercialization of products that may arise from the collaboration 
we have had no other income since inception other than interest income from short term investments 
in contrast to cerovive nxy  which is licensed to astrazeneca  we hold worldwide rights to commercialize ren and ren if either or both of these product candidates receives regulatory approval we may choose to market and sell the product candidate ourselves or with a partner in exchange for upfront fees  milestones and royalties on future sales  if any 
we currently contract with outside firms to manufacture ren and ren and have no plans to establish internal manufacturing capability 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for at least another months 
however  changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume our capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
acquisition in december  we acquired the pharmaceutical assets and intellectual property of centaur pharmaceuticals  inc centaur in a transaction accounted for as an acquisition of assets 
in connection with this asset acquisition  we paid centaur cash of million and million shares of our series d preferred stock which converted into  shares of common stock upon the consummation of our initial public offering valued at approximately million 
in addition  we incurred acquisition costs of million 
revenues to date  all of our revenue has been earned under agreements with astrazeneca and genentech 
we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales or royalties until at least  if at all 
we seek to generate revenue from a combination of product sales  upfront fees and milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the license of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of milestone payments we may receive from our collaborative or strategic relationships  as well as those we may receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
revenue derived from collaborative and strategic relationships helps us fund our operations and may increase in the future if we are successful in achieving milestones in our existing collaborations  licensing our technology and establishing new collaborations or strategic relationships 
if we are unsuccessful in these goals  our revenues will decline and we may be required to limit our research and development  clinical trial  manufacturing and marketing efforts 
research and development expenses our research and development r d expenses consist primarily of costs associated with research  preclinical development and clinical trials involving product opportunities in the areas of neuroprotection  pain and neuroinflammatory diseases 
we do not incur research and development costs for cerovive nxy  which is licensed to astrazeneca 
the expenses we incur in connection with our research  preclinical and clinical development consist primarily of employee compensation  supplies and materials  
table of contents costs for consultants  contract research and clinical trials including non cash expenses for options granted to non employees  license fees  facilities and overhead costs  funded r d at other companies and research institutions  manufacturing of clinical drug supplies  and depreciation of equipment 
r d costs  including some upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators  are expensed as incurred 
the timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in our future r d expenses 
prior to our acquisition of pharmaceutical assets from centaur in december  we had incurred research and development expenses of approximately million to assemble a team of neurobiologists and establish specialized capabilities in assay development  screening  lead optimization  target identification and target validation  which we used to pursue early stage research in the areas of neuroprotection and pain 
we are unable to estimate the portion of costs incurred that are allocable to the individual research activities we have conducted because we do not segregate costs among early stage research programs for both management and external reporting 
moreover  given the early stage nature of these projects and the subsequent integration of intellectual property and product opportunities that we acquired from centaur  we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost or timeline required to generate cash inflows from our research efforts 
during the twelve months ended december  and  we incurred research and development expenses of million and million  respectively 
the total r d costs related to individual research activities are as follows in millions year ended december  clinical development activities preclinical r d programs our clinical development efforts during were focused exclusively on initiating and conducting multiple phase ii clinical trials with ren and ren as described above  we discontinued clinical development activities involving ren during in march  we announced our decision to discontinue development of ren in phn while continuing a phase ii clinical trial in sciatica 
our preclinical r d activities during included toxicology and efficacy studies of various development candidates in preclinical models of pain and neuroinflammatory disease as well as formulation and manufacturing of drug supply for these studies 
the preclinical r d amount of million was expended primarily on employee costs  supplies and materials and infrastructure related to neurobiology  chemistry  cell biology and related functions associated with our earlier stage research in the areas of neuroprotection  pain and neuroinflammatory diseases 
our preclinical and clinical development expenses during were primarily related to activities required to advance ren and ren to ind filings with the fda and into clinical trials that commenced in the second half of and the first quarter of  respectively 
the preclinical r d amount of million was expended primarily on employee costs  supplies and materials and infrastructure related to neurobiology  chemistry and related functions associated with our earlier stage research in the areas of neuroprotection  pain and neuroinflammatory diseases 
development timelines and costs are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly for each product candidate and from quarter to quarter 
the process of seeking regulatory approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions  including finance  human resources and business development 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
we anticipate incurring increases in general and administrative expenses  such as increased costs for compliance with certain sections of the sarbanes oxley act of  insurance and investor relations associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
these increases will also likely include the hiring of additional personnel 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue under our collaborative agreements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the agreement 
amounts received under such arrangements consist of upfront license fees and include periodic milestone payments upon the achievement of certain events 
upfront payments which are subject to future performance requirements are recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized over the performance period 
the performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is periodically reevaluated 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized which would result in an acceleration or delay of expected revenue recognition 
payments received related to substantive  at risk milestones are recognized upon achievement of the scientific or regulatory event specified in the underlying agreement 
stock compensation we account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
 and related interpretations and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes to the assumptions used in the black scholes model may materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we are currently evaluating our option 
table of contents valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of sfas no 
r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their values beginning july  acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development relates primarily to purchased in licensed technology  intellectual property and know how 
we evaluate the stage of development of acquired projects  taking into account the level of effort  time and estimated cost associated with further developing the in process technology and producing a commercial product 
the nature of the remaining efforts for completion of acquired in process research and development projects generally include completion of clinical trials  completion of manufacturing validation  interpretation of clinical and preclinical data and obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory bodies  the cost  length and success of which are extremely difficult to determine 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist with timely completion of development projects  including clinical trial results  manufacturing process development results  and ongoing feedback from regulatory authorities  including obtaining marketing approval 
in addition  acquired products under development may never be successfully commercialized due to the uncertainties associated with the pricing of new pharmaceuticals  the cost of sales to produce these products in a commercial setting  changes in the reimbursement environment or the introduction of new competitive products 
as a result of the uncertainties noted above  we expense such acquired in process research and development projects when incurred 
clinical study activities and other expenses from third party contract research organizations some of our research and development  including certain clinical study activity  is conducted by various third parties  including contract research organizations  which may also provide contractually defined administration and management services 
we recognize expenses for these contracted activities based upon a variety of factors  including actual and estimated patient enrollment rates  clinical site initiation activities  labor hours and other activity based factors 
on a regular basis  our estimates of these costs are reconciled to actual invoices from the service providers  and adjustments are made accordingly 
results of operations comparison of the twelve months ended december   and revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the twelve months ended december  we had no revenue for the twelve months ended december  the revenue resulted from a collaboration agreement which we entered into with genentech at the end of under this agreement with genentech we received an upfront payment of million that we are recognizing as contract revenue on a straight line basis over the two year estimated research period of the agreement 
the revenue represented million in milestone payments we earned from astrazeneca upon commencement of the phase iii clinical trials with cerovive nxy 
research and development expenses total research and development expenses and dollar and percentage change as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands year ended december  total r d expense dollar increase percentage increase 
table of contents the increase in r d expense in over was primarily due to increased product development activities 
we advanced ren and ren into phase ii clinical trials during the second half of and the first quarter of  respectively  and conducted multiple phase ii clinical trials with both product candidates during most of also in  we conducted preclinical studies with ren to support filing an ind and advancing the drug candidate into a phase i clinical trial that commenced in the first quarter of in addition  we made new investments in expanding our research programs in the areas of neuroprotection and pain during specific increases included the following external clinical trial costs increased by million as a direct result of multiple clinical trials with ren and ren that were ongoing during most of  employee costs increased by million as we added r d personnel to expand our capabilities in assay development  chemistry  pharmacology  and clinical development 
these new employees were integral to progress in our research programs in the areas of neuroprotection  pain and neuroinflammation as well as conduct of the clinical trials with ren and ren employee costs also increased due to annual merit pay increases and rising employee benefit costs  outside service costs increased by million as we utilized third parties to assist with preclinical development of ren and the conduct of clinical trials with ren and ren  license fees increased by million in connection with the licensing of intellectual property for use in our preclinical development programs  including a one time fee that we paid to cutanix corporation cutanix to secure exclusive rights to certain chemical compounds that were previously subject to limited development and commercialization rights held by cutanix 
laboratory supplies and related material costs increased by million as a result of the expansion of our preclinical programs in neuroprotection  pain and neuroinflammatory diseases  and amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the centaur acquisition increased by million primarily due to additional contingent consideration that was recognized in may as all earn out conditions related to the asset acquisition were met 
we recorded a portion of the additional contingent consideration as an intangible asset in the second quarter of which resulted in additional quarterly amortization expense commencing in the second quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing expense of million in in our manufacturing effort was limited to production of ren for preclinical studies and phase i clinical trials that we initiated in february in we incurred greater manufacturing expenses as we contracted with outside parties to manufacture drug supplies for our phase ii clinical trials with ren and ren the increase in r d expense in over was primarily due to factors related to the expansion of our preclinical development activity in to advance ren and ren into clinical trials and the establishment of new research programs in the areas of pain and neuroinflammatory diseases to capitalize on intellectual property purchased from centaur in december specific increases included the following employee costs increased by million primarily due to the increased number of employees in our preclinical and clinical development operations  merit pay increases and increasing benefit costs  consulting costs increased million primarily due to non cash compensation related to stock options previously issued to consultants that became vested during the period and for consulting services associated with the advancement of ren and ren into the clinic  outside testing and analysis increased by million primarily due to the advancement of ren and ren into the clinic  manufacturing costs totaled million in compared to in as we contracted with outside parties to manufacture drug supplies for our clinical trials with ren and ren  
table of contents facilities related expenses allocated to r d increased by million in primarily due to our consolidation of facilities into a larger facility in south san francisco in to accommodate our expanding preclinical and clinical development activities  and amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the centaur acquisition increased by million primarily due to a full year of amortization expense being recognized in as compared to one month of amortization expense being recognized in additionally  during additional contingent consideration was recognized in may as all earn out conditions related to the asset acquisition were met 
a portion of this additional contingent consideration was recorded by the company as an intangible asset which resulted in additional amortization expense of million in excluded from research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  and was million and million  respectively  of employee stock based compensation which is reported under a separate caption see further discussion below under amortization of employee stock based compensation 
there was no employee stock based compensation for the twelve months ended december  the table below summarizes the current status of our drug candidates program indication clinical status commencement of current phase cerovive nxy acute ischemic stroke phase iii second quarter ren neuropathic pain sciatica phase ii third quarter ren multiple sclerosis phase i first quarter we estimate that typical phase i clinical trials will take to months to complete  phase ii clinical trials are expected to last approximately to months and phase iii clinical trials are expected to last approximately to months 
however  the length of clinical trials varies substantially based upon factors such as the intended use of the clinical product and the ability to enroll appropriate patients 
additionally  clinical trials of our drug candidates may fail to demonstrate safety and clinically significant efficacy which would prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in future periods as we continue to advance existing drug candidates into later stages of clinical trials and move preclinical products into clinical trials 
however  we currently do not have estimates of total costs to reach regulatory approval for each drug candidate or in the aggregate as our drug candidates are subject to an uncertain and lengthy regulatory process which may not result in obtaining the necessary regulatory approval 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative g a expenses and dollar and percentage change as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands year ended december  total g a expense dollar increase percentage increase the increase in g a expense in over is primarily due to investments in protecting intellectual property generated from our preclinical research programs and establishing administrative capabilities and infrastructure appropriate for a public company 
specific increases included the following legal expenses increased million primarily related to the costs of pursuing patent protection for discoveries made in our research programs  
table of contents employee costs increased million related to new hires  merit pay increases  and costs associated with certain severance agreements in  and outside services costs increased million due to professional fees for investor relations  market research  and other costs necessary to establish infrastructure appropriate for a public company 
the increase in g a expense in over is primarily due to the following factors employee related expenses increased by million 
the increase is primarily due to newly hired executives and severance costs incurred in legal and other professional fees increased by million 
the increase is primarily due to increased costs to support our business development and research activities 
during  we completed a strategic alliance with genentech and filed for patents as compared to during excluded from general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  and was million and million  respectively  of employee stock based compensation which is reported under a separate caption see further discussion below under amortization of employee stock based compensation 
there was no employee stock based compensation for the twelve months ended december  we expect g a expenses to increase in the future reflecting increased support activities associated with advancing existing drug candidates into later stages of clinical trials and advancing preclinical products into clinical trials and expenses associated with increased corporate governance regulation principally associated with the sarbanes oxley act of amortization of employee stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and directors  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million representing the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock and the option exercise price at the date of grant 
we recorded this amount as a component of stockholders equity net capital deficiency and are amortizing the amount  on a straight line basis  as a non cash charge to operations over the vesting period of the options 
we recorded amortization of employee stock based compensation of million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
there was no deferred stock compensation or related employee stock based amortization for the twelve months ended december  as of december   we had million of deferred stock compensation and we anticipate recording the remaining amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of approximately million  million  and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
purchased in process research and development 
total purchased in process research and development expense and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands year ended december  total purchased in process r d expense dollar decrease increase percentage decrease increase in connection with the acquisition of pharmaceutical assets and intellectual property from centaur in december  and the related purchase price allocation  we recorded an expense of million in the fourth quarter of  representing the write off of the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in the second 
table of contents quarter of we recorded an additional expense of million upon the commencement of phase iii clinical trials for cerovive nxy by astrazeneca  which triggered a contingent payment of additional shares of our series d preferred stock to centaur 
the principal technology acquired as part of the centaur acquisition related to cerovive nxy and ren that were in the process of being developed 
the fair value of each of the in process research and development projects was based on an income approach that attempts to estimate the future cash flows from the technology based on its successful development  net of tax 
in there was no purchased in process r d expense 
interest income 
total interest income and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands year ended december  total interest income dollar increase decrease percentage increase decrease the increase in over in interest income was primarily attributable to higher cash and investment balances due to our initial public offering completed in early february the decrease in as compared to was due to lower average cash and investment balances and lower prevailing interest rates during when compared to interest expense 
total interest expense and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are in thousands year ended december  total interest expense dollar decrease percentage decrease the decrease in interest expense for was primarily due to the lower aggregate interest rates on our debt balances related to the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
the decrease in interest expense for was primarily due to our lower average debt balances during the period compared to the period 
financial guidance we expect our operating expenses to increase as we continue to advance existing drug candidates into later stages of clinical trials and move preclinical products into clinical trials 
for the year ending december   the company presently anticipates total contract revenue from existing agreements of approximately million  and total operating expenses of million to million 
this guidance does not include the impact of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which the company is required to adopt in the third quarter of see recent accounting pronouncements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities as well as through equipment and leasehold improvement financing 
as of december   we had received approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
in february  we received approximately million from our initial public offering of common stock and concurrent private placement with genentech 
in addition  as of december   we had financed through loans the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements totaling approximately million  of which million was outstanding at that date 
these obligations are secured by the purchased equipment and leasehold improvements  bear interest at rates ranging from approximately to and are due in monthly installments through december as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
this increase resulted primarily from the net proceeds of million from our initial public offering and concurrent private placement with genentech  partially offset by cash used in operating activities and principal payments on notes 
net cash used in operating activities amounted to million for the twelve months ended december   primarily reflecting the net loss occurring for this period of million  partially offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  amortization of deferred stock compensation of million and other non cash charges related to equity issuance of million 
net cash used in investing activities excluding net proceeds from purchases  sales and maturities of short term investments for the twelve months ended december  amounted to million 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the twelve months ended december   primarily reflecting the net proceeds received from our initial public offering and proceeds from additional credit facilities  offset by principal payments on credit facilities 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
this increase resulted primarily from the net proceeds of million from the sale of series e preferred stock  partially offset by our operating loss and principal payments on notes 
net cash used in operating activities amounted to million for the twelve months ended december   primarily reflecting the net loss occurring for this period of million  partially offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  write off of acquired in process research and development purchased with preferred stock million  impairment of leasehold improvements million and amortization of deferred stock compensation of million 
net cash used in investing activities excluding net proceeds from purchases  sales and maturities of short term investments for the twelve months ended december  amounted to million 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the twelve months ended december   primarily reflecting the net proceeds received from the sale of series e preferred stock and proceeds from additional credit facilities  offset by principal payments on credit facilities 
the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  total thereafter operating leases equipment financing total we have entered into a variety of license agreements relating to our research and development efforts  most of which relate to product candidates in the early stage of preclinical development 
we have a cancelable license agreement relating to our product candidate in clinical trials  cerovive nxy 
under this agreement  we could be required to pay  annually in minimum royalty payments through nda approval and  annually in minimum royalty payments after nda approval 
additionally  low single digit royalties are payable on net product sales 

table of contents our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress of preclinical development and laboratory testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by evolving requirements of regulatory agencies  the number of product candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our plans to establish sales  marketing and or manufacturing capabilities  our ability to establish  enforce and maintain selected strategic alliances and activities required for product commercialization  the acquisition of technologies  products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments  and our revenues  if any  from successful development and commercialization of our products 
based upon our current operating plan we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of december  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources 
we may be required to seek additional sources of funding to complete development and commercialization of our products 
if we need to raise funds in the future  we may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that the funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy 
we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on july   the beginning of our third quarter 

table of contents sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb no 
opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the valuation model we ultimately select 
we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of sfas no 
r related to employee stock options 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share in note to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
