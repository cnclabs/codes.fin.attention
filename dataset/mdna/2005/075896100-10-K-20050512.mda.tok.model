the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be relevant under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in particular  judgment is used in areas such as the provision for sales returns  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets  income taxes and accruals for self insurance  litigation and store opening  expansion  relocation and closing costs 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
sales returns sales returns  which are reserved for based on historical experience  are provided for in the period that the related sales are recorded

the company has not historically had any material impairment of long lived assets 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the estimated cash flows generated by the company s long lived assets to the extent that an asset is impaired  the company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs 
goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets the company reviews goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
impairment testing is based upon the best information available including estimates of fair value which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value

self insurance the company utilizes a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability and employee related health care benefits a portion of which is paid by its employees 
liabilities associated with the risks that the company retains are estimated by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
although the company s claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past  actual experience could materially vary from its historical experience in the future 
factors that affect these estimates include but are not limited to inflation  the number and severity of claims and regulatory changes 
in the future  if the company concludes an adjustment to self insurance accruals is required  the liability will be adjusted accordingly 
litigation the company records an estimated liability related to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business which is based on available information and advice from outside counsel  where appropriate 
as additional information becomes available  the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revises its estimates as appropriate
