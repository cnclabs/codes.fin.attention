general the parent company is a bank holding company founded in and headquartered in jeffersonville  new york 
the parent company owns of the outstanding shares of the bank s common stock and derives substantially all of its income from the bank s operations in the form of dividends paid to the parent company 
the bank is a new york commercial bank chartered in serving sullivan county  new york with branch offices in jeffersonville  eldred  liberty  loch sheldrake  monticello  livingston manor  narrowsburg  callicoon and wurtsboro 
the bank s administrative offices are located in jeffersonville  new york 
the company s mission is to serve the community banking needs of its borrowers and depositors  who predominantly are individuals  small businesses and local municipal governments 
the company believes it understands its local customer needs and provides quality service with a personal touch 
the financial results of the company are influenced by economic events that affect the communities we serve as well as national economic trends  primarily interest rates  affecting the entire banking industry 
changes in net interest income have the greatest impact on the company s net income 
national economic policies have caused interest rates to begin a slow rise in the company s marketplace over the past six months 
despite this  the company s yields on interest earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities are not responding accordingly and fell in locally  the economy continued to exhibit strength in while the local economic forecast has been bright  it should be acknowledged that the economy in most other areas of new york state continues to be sluggish 
significant improvement in the local economy continues to be demonstrated in the sullivan county real estate market 
several major projects continued to progress along with a vibrant real estate market  which increase optimism in the county s future 
a permanent concert facility has begun construction on the original site of the woodstock festival in bethel this year 
a major health care facility employing people opened in monticello raceway has opened a video slots gaming center in the summer of several native american run casinos are still on the horizon 
the success of these projects  tourism  real estate values and the availability of qualified labor is critical to the local economy and the company 
critical accounting policies management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and values of real estate particularly in sullivan county 
collateral underlying certain real estate loans could lose value which could lead to future additions to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
financial condition total assets increased by million or to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to a million or increase in net loans from million at december  to million at december  a net decrease of million in the portfolio of securities available for sale for  due to maturities and calls  was the main funding source for new loan growth 
the overall assets increase was funded by a million increase in total deposits from million at december  to million at december  much of the securities portfolio remains funded with long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank  a leveraging strategy implemented since in which the company funded security purchases with fhlb borrowings at a positive interest rate spread 
in  total gross loans increased million or from million to million 
within the loan portfolio  commercial real estate loans increased million to million at december   residential real estate increased by million to million  home equity loans increased million to million  commercial loans increased by million while consumer installment loans decreased million to million 
the growth in commercial real estate loans reflects the company s strategy to provide loans for local real estate projects where there is strong loan to value ratio taking into consideration possible speculation regarding casino gambling proposals 
the growth in residential mortgages reflects new products to meet the highly competitive nature of this market 
as a result of casino gambling proposals and related local economic improvement  the company anticipates continued residential and commercial real estate loan opportunities 
accordingly  additional growth is anticipated in real estate loans during the growth in the non real estate commercial loan portfolio reflects continued business growth in the county 
the overall loan portfolio is structured in accordance with management s belief that loans secured by residential and commercial real estate generally result in lower loan loss levels compared to other types of loans  because of the value of the underlying collateral 
in the event that the casino gambling proposals do not progress  collateral underlying certain real estate projects could lose value 
there was no other real estate owned at december  as compared to  at december  total non performing loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  net loan charge offs increased from  in to  in at december   the allowance for loan losses equaled million representing of total gross loans outstanding and of total non performing loans 
total deposits increased million to million at december  from million at december  within the deposit mix  lower costing core deposits increased as did higher costing time deposits 
much of the increase in deposits was caused by the continued growth of newer branches and the attraction of new customers from larger regional banks 
the company continues to be successful in increasing demand deposit balances  which provides a pool of low cost funds for reinvestment opportunities 
demand deposits increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
time deposits increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
total stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million from december  the increase was due primarily to net income of million partially offset by cash dividends of million and a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income of results of operations versus net income net income for of million increased or  from the net income of million 
the higher level of earnings in reflects the interaction of a number of factors 
the most significant factor which increased net income was the increase in loan interest and fees of million to million from million or 
the increase in interest income on loans was partially offset by a decrease in interest income on securities which went down from million in to million in the provision for loan losses decreased or  from  in to  in salary and employee benefit expense increased  or primarily due to the addition of new employees  normal salary increases and the increased costs of providing pension and health care benefits

interest income and interest expense throughout the following discussion  net interest income and its components are expressed on a tax equivalent basis which means that  where appropriate  tax exempt income is shown as if it were earned on a fully taxable basis 
the largest source of income for the company is net interest income  which represents interest earned on loans  securities and short term investments  less interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities

provisions for loan losses are recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
the provision for loan losses was reduced in due to the reduction in both non performing loans and net charge offs as noted below 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  particularly in sullivan county 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of all or a portion of the principal is unlikely 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized 
total non performing loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  net loan charge offs increased from  in to  in while gross charge offs decreased from  in to  in summary of loan loss experience the following table indicates the amount of charge offs and recoveries in the loan portfolio by category

management strives to identify potential non performing loans early  take charge offs promptly based on a realistic assessment of probable losses  and maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses based on the inherent risk of loss in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance s coverage of non performing loans was at december  compared to and at december  and respectively 
no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any loan or group of loans  as the entire allowance is available to absorb charge offs in any loan category 
the amount and timing of future charge offs and allowance allocations may vary from current estimates and will depend on local economic conditions 
the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to major portfolio categories and the percentage of each loan category to total loans outstanding

the majority of the company s total nonaccrual and past due loans are secured loans and  as such  management anticipates there will be limited risk of loss in their ultimate resolution 
from time to time  loans may be renegotiated in a troubled debt restructuring when the company determines that it will ultimately receive greater economic value under the new terms than through foreclosure  liquidation  or bankruptcy 
candidates for renegotiation must meet specific guidelines

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information concerning off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity liquidity is the ability to provide sufficient cash flow to meet financial commitments such as additional loan demand and withdrawals of existing deposits 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are its deposit base  fhlb borrowings  repayments and maturities on loans  short term assets such as federal funds and short term interest bearing deposits in banks  and maturities and sales of securities available for sale 
these sources are available in amounts sufficient to provide liquidity to meet the company s ongoing funding requirements

recent accounting pronouncements the emerging issues task force eitf has provided guidance for the determination and recognition of other than temporary impairment on investment securities in eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
generally  an impairment is considered other than temporary unless i the investor has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment  and ii evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
if impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss should be recognized equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
certain disclosure requirements of eitf were adopted in and the company has presented the new disclosure requirements in its consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and the recognition and measurement provisions were initially effective for other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after june  however  in september  the effective date of these provisions was delayed until the finalization of a fasb staff position to provide addition implementation guidance 
upon finalization of the fasb staff position  management will evaluate the impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management of interest rate risk involves continual monitoring of the relative sensitivity of asset and liability portfolios to changes in rates due to maturities or repricing 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing of assets and liabilities through maturity and interest rate changes 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to maintain an appropriate balance between income growth and the risks associated with maximizing income through the mismatch of the timing of interest rate changes between assets and liabilities 
perfectly matching the repricing of assets and liabilities can eliminate interest rate risk  but net interest income is not always enhanced 
one measure of interest rate risk  the so called gap  is illustrated in the table below as of december  this table measures the incremental and cumulative gap  or difference between assets and liabilities subject to repricing during the periods indicated 
the dollar amounts presented are stated on the basis of contractual gap which measures the stated repricing and maturity of assets and liabilities 
the data presented indicates that rate sensitive liabilities are generally subject to repricing sooner than rate sensitive assets 
management retains the ability to change  or not change  interest rates on certain deposit products as general market rates change in the future  and is also in the position to liquidate a portion of its securities available for sale should conditions warrant such action 
the following is one of several different analysis tools management utilizes in managing interest rate risk 
to to to over maturity months months years years total loans  net      taxable securities      non taxable securities     total interest earning assets      now and super now accounts      savings and insured money market deposits       time deposits      long term borrowings    short term borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities      gap      cumulative gap     cumulative gap as a percentage of total interest earning assets based on anticipated maturity 
includes securities available for sale and securities held to maturity  at their amortized cost 
based on contractual maturity or period to repricing 
fixed rate deposits and deposits with fixed pricing intervals are included in the period of contractual maturity 
deposits withdrawable on demand or within short notice periods such as now and savings accounts are shown in repricing periods based on management s estimate of the interest rate sensitivity of these accounts  based in part on the company s favorable historical experience of a substantial portion of these balances during periods of changing interest rates 
there are several significant shortcomings inherent in the gap analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities have similar periods to maturity or to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while other interest rates may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
management takes these factors  and others  into consideration when reviewing the company s gap position and establishing its asset liability strategy
