in addition  in order to enhance our focus on the communications market and our end customers  we report information by the following market segments wide area networks and storage area networks wan san  wireless infrastructure and wireless terminal win wit  computation and consumer  and our cypress subsidiaries 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
our revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or compared to revenues for fiscal  and an increase of million or compared to revenues for fiscal the revenue increase in fiscal was attributable primarily to an increase in unit shipments 
average selling prices asps remained stable in the first half of fiscal  increased in the third quarter of fiscal before decreasing in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  our revenues improved across all of our market segments except for computation and consumer  which remained flat to the prior year 
in general  as we look ahead to fiscal  we believe that inventory corrections and soft demand in certain segments will continue in the first quarter of the year  resulting in revenues that are similar to the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe revenues will show sequential improvement during fiscal  with 
table of contents significant contributions from sunpower and acquisitions we made in fiscal  resulting in a slight increase in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of fillfactory nv fillfactory and cascade semiconductor corporation cascade  which contributed million to our total revenues 
sunpower contributed million to our total revenues in fiscal our gross margins improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal as changes in product mix and increased manufacturing efficiencies more than offset the small overall asp decline 
however  we experienced a drop in gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal to due to under utilization of our manufacturing facilities and decreasing asps 
we expect gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal to remain relatively flat to the fourth quarter of fiscal and then increase sequentially during the remainder of fiscal such that the overall fiscal gross margin percentage will be between to 
one of the growth drivers we expect in fiscal is our entry into the solar cell market through sunpower 
sunpower s business model is different from the other businesses  such that we expect the gross margins on these products to be lower than our historical average gross margin  thus effectively diluting our aggregate gross margin percentage 
however  the sunpower business model targets lower operating expenses  such that their operating margin contribution should be in line with the rest of our businesses and not detrimental to our overall financial performance 
research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  which were million or higher than fiscal primarily as a result of higher sales commissions driven by higher sales  a modest company wide salary increase in april  increase in professional fees and an increase in research and development supply and facilities costs driven by the ramp up of our sunpower manufacturing facility 
from a liquidity and capital resources standpoint  management has emphasized generating a positive cash flow from operations 
our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
as of the end of fiscal  total cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash were million  a million reduction from the end of fiscal this decrease was primarily due to cash used for acquisitions  capital investment and retirement of debt  partially offset by a positive cash flow from operations 
results of operations business segment net revenues year ended january  december  december  in thousands memory non memory sunpower total net revenues memory the semiconductor industry utilizes several types of metrics to analyze price performance and industry trends 
we use two measurements of pricing for memory products asp per unit and asp per megabit mbit 
these metrics indicate the price and technology trends that impact memory revenues 
as the memory capacity mbit density of units sold increases  the asp of each unit tends to increase ie  a mbit part will sell at a higher price than an mbit part 
however  unit pricing does not scale linearly by mbit  which usually means increasing the unit sales of higher priced  higher density units typically yields a lower asp per 
table of contents mbit 
therefore  if we sell an increasing number of higher priced  higher density units  asp per unit will most likely increase while the asp per mbit will most likely decrease 
we use the metrics asp per unit and asp per mbit in conjunction with one another as indicators of market trends and our operational performance 
the metric asp per unit utilizes total product revenues and total units sold as the basis for the calculation 
an increasing asp per unit metric here indicates that we are selling units at a higher average price  which usually indicates that either more units are being sold at higher densities or that average prices are going up  both positive trends for us 
the metric asp per mbit utilizes product revenues and the aggregate volume of megabits sold 
asp per mbit shows the average selling price for million bits mbit of memory capacity 
asp per mbit is calculated by dividing the asp per unit by the average size of the memory products sold 
since unit pricing does not scale linearly by mbit  increasing the unit sales of higher priced  higher density units typically yields a lower asp per mbit  but is a positive indicator of our performance as it implies sales of higher density units which typically indicates sales into newer and higher value added technology applications  both positive trends for us 
in reviewing these two metrics asp and asp per mbit in combination with one another  we would expect the two metrics to move in opposition to one another 
increasing asp per unit and decreasing asp per mbit at the same relative rate should be construed as a favorable situation 
conversely  decreasing asp per unit and increasing asp per mbit could indicate an unfavorable market trend for us 
we routinely receive questions regarding these metrics from industry analysts familiar with the dynamics of these metrics in public forums 
revenues for the sales of memory products for fiscal increased million or compared with revenues for fiscal the increase was primarily due to a increase in mbits sold  offset partially by a decrease in asp per mbit 
this was indicative of selling more units at higher density  given that price per mbit does not scale linearly as density increases 
this revenue increase was also indicative of mbits per unit sales increasing faster than the decrease in asp per mbit 
revenues for the sales of memory products for fiscal increased million or compared with revenues for fiscal a increase in mbits sold was partially offset by a decrease in asp per mbit 
this revenue increase was also indicative of mbits per unit sales increasing faster than the decrease in asp per mbit 
non memory revenues in fiscal from the sales of non memory products increased million or compared with revenues for fiscal the increase in non memory product revenues was primarily driven by million revenue growth from our network search engine products and million revenue growth from our universal serial bus family of products 
a million decrease in our timing product revenues in fiscal partially offset the revenue increases 
in fiscal  overall asps remained flat compared to fiscal for non memory products 
revenues in fiscal from the sales of non memory products increased million or compared with revenues for fiscal the increase in non memory product revenues  as compared to fiscal  was driven by revenue growth from our network search engines  programmable logic devices  physical layer devices  multi ports devices and universal serial bus family of products 
our subsidiaries silicon light machine slm and cypress microsystems cms also contributed to the revenue growth 
in fiscal  asps decreased as compared to fiscal for non memory products 

table of contents sunpower revenues in fiscal from the sales of sunpower products increased million or compared with revenues for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the initial sales of solar cell a products in the second half of fiscal market segment net revenues years ended january  december  december  in thousands wan san win wit computation and consumer cypress subsidiaries total net revenues wan san revenues from the sale of wan san products for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal our growing network search engine business contributed approximately million of this increase 
other products contributing to the segment growth included our micropower synchronous static random access memory sram and high speed synchronous sram products 
revenues from the sale of wan san products for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal improvement in the overall enterprise networking market has been followed by increases in broader based networking sales 
wan san product revenues increased as compared to fiscal due to increased demand for our network search engines 
this segment also experienced growth due to our acquisition of micron technology s high performance communications orientated sram product portfolio inventory in the second quarter of fiscal win wit revenues from the sale of win wit products for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal approximately million of this growth was contributed by our micropower srams  which was driven by the adoption of our one transistor pseudo sram products 
this segment has also benefited from a slight increase in our timing products 
revenues from the sale of win wit products for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal the revenue increase was attributable in part to strength in the handset business and a continued shift to a higher density sram product mix 
revenue in this segment is dominated by our mobl and micropower srams product families 
computation and consumer revenues from the sale of computation and consumer products for fiscal decreased million or compared to fiscal the decrease in revenue was primarily due to a reduction in sales of our frequency timing products compared to the fiscal revenue decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of image sensor revenue from our acquisition of fillfactory in the third quarter of fiscal revenues from the sale of computation and consumer products for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal in the computation sector  pc related demand grew due to the increase in the adoption rate of usb technology  a serial plug and play connection standard for pcs and peripherals 
growth in the consumer sector was driven by sales of our programmable clocks 

table of contents cypress subsidiaries revenues from the cypress subsidiaries for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal this increase was driven primarily by the continued production ramp of psoc products from cms  and the late market introduction of sunpower solar cells 
revenues from the cypress subsidiaries for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal the growth was driven by increased psoc product revenue from cms  and increased non recurring engineering revenue  product revenue  and license revenue from slm 
in addition  revenue increased as a result of the consolidation of sunpower  effective at the beginning of fiscal cost of revenues gross margin cost of revenues was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
although our overall asps declined during fiscal  we were generally able to offset this effect and increase our gross margin percentage by as compared with fiscal this increase in gross margin was attributable to the continued reduction of manufacturing cycle times  reduced die size  improved labor productivity  more efficient use of capital resources  improved defect densities  improved yields and ultimately lower manufacturing cost  partially offset by the decline in the favorable impact of inventory adjustments  as discussed below 
although our overall asps declined during fiscal  we were generally able to offset this effect and increase our gross margin percentage by as compared with fiscal this increase in gross margin is attributable to the continued reduction of manufacturing cycle times  reduced die size  improved labor productivity  more efficient use of capital resources  improved defect densities  improved yields and ultimately lower manufacturing costs 
inventory reserves our gross margin has been impacted by the timing of inventory adjustments related to inventory write downs and the subsequent sale of these written down products caused by the general state of our business including our inventory profile 
the table below sets forth the gross margin and the impact of inventory adjustments on gross margin 
year ended january  december  december  in thousands gross margin impact of inventory adjustments benefit the amount of reserved inventory on hand was million  million and million at the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
we record inventory write downs as a result of our normal analysis of demand forecasts and the aging profile of the inventory 
we record charges to cost of goods sold in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to write down the carrying values of our inventories when their estimated market values are less than their carrying values 
the inventory write downs reflect estimates of future market pricing relative to the costs of production and inventory carrying values and projected timing of product sales 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and volatile 
in recent years  a combination of global economic conditions and a slowing growth rate in the demand for semiconductors  coupled with worldwide increases in semiconductor production capacity  caused significant declines in demand and average selling prices for semiconductor components 
these trends could continue in the future and could cause us to re evaluate our inventory costs  which could result in additional inventory reserves 
in reviewing our inventory reserves  we follow methodologies that are consistent with those used by other companies within the semiconductor industry 
at the time of an inventory write down  we make a determination  based on demand forecasts and the aging profile of the inventory  that there is a very high 
table of contents probability that the inventory that was reserved would not be sold 
once the inventory is written down  a new cost basis is effectively established through the use of a contra asset account ie a reserve 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 the contra asset account is relieved at the time the inventory is either sold or scrapped 
we have formal programs to periodically scrap reserved inventory 
at january   the remaining reserve represented excess and obsolete inventories that have not been scrapped or sold 
segment cost of revenues gross margin our gross margin improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal our gross margin improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal following is gross margin discussion by our segments business segments small increases in our fiscal memory segment gross margin percentage were offset by small decreases in our fiscal non memory segment gross margin percentage 
as sunpower began shipments of solar cells in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the impact of its margin to the business segments in fiscal compared to fiscal was not significant 
our gross margin improvement in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the improvement in the non memory segment 
in fiscal  sunpower had no gross margin impact on business segment margins as we had not begun consolidating its results 
market segments small increases in gross margin percentage of our win wit and computation and consumer segments were offset by small decreases in gross margin percentage of our wan san market segment 
our gross margin improvement in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to improvements in the computation and consumer segment 
research and development year ended january  december  december  in thousands revenues research and development research and development as a percentage of revenues research and development r d expenditures in fiscal increased from fiscal primarily due to a million increase in salaries and other compensation due to a moderate pay increase  and a million increase in expenses related to sunpower consisting primarily of costs of test operations and facility expenses in the philippines manufacturing site 
sunpower began shipments of solar cell products in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and prior to this period  expenses were primarily r d and selling  general and administrative 
the increase in r d expenses was partially offset by million in depreciation 
r d expenses in fiscal decreased from fiscal due to closing down of design centers  headcount reductions in existing locations and a reduction in non cash deferred stock compensation 
to keep pace with changing business conditions and with our customers needs  we have scaled back on some of our process and design engineering projects and refocused our attention on fewer projects that are critical to our success 
selling  general and administrative year ended january  december  december  in thousands revenues selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative as a percentage of revenues 
table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal increased from fiscal primarily due to an approximately million increase in salaries and other compensation due to a moderate pay increase  a million increase in professional fees primarily associated with new requirements under the sarbanes oxley act  a million increase in sales commissions driven by increased revenues  a million increase in travel expenses and a million charge for a damage claim settlement 
the increase in sg a expenses was partially offset by a million credit primarily associated with the release of the allowance for uncollectible accounts relating to outstanding loans to employees under the employee stock purchase assistance plan 
sg a expenses in fiscal decreased from fiscal primarily due to continuing cost cutting measures including our efforts to utilize tight control on outside services and discretionary spending  and a decrease in non cash deferred compensation and contingent compensation charges related to our acquisitions of million 
sg a also benefited in fiscal compared with fiscal due to an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts of million in fiscal for loans outstanding to employees under our employee stock purchase assistance plan 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets the following table summarizes the components year ended january  december  december  in thousands amortization of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets total amortization and impairment of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives ranging from to years 
impairment of intangible assets during the third quarter of fiscal  slm  a subsidiary of cypress  continued to experience a severe economic downturn in the optical market in which slm participates 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we performed an impairment review on all of slm s intangible assets and recorded an impairment charge of million related to purchased technology 
no impairment existed in other intangible assets 
the fair value of purchased technology was determined using the income approach method  which was based on a discounted forecast of the estimated net future cash flows to be generated from the intangible assets using a discount rate of 
the carrying amount of purchased technology was million and the fair value was determined to be million  resulting in an impairment loss of million 
we noted no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets in fiscal and impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as part of our annual impairment review of the carrying value of our goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to slm 
no impairment existed in goodwill associated with other reporting units 
the fair value of goodwill associated with slm was determined based on the income approach method  which estimated the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows using a discount rate of 
the carrying amount of goodwill was million and the fair value was deemed to be zero  resulting in an impairment charge of million 

table of contents we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarters of fiscal and and determined that there was no impairment related to our goodwill 
in process research and development charges in connection with our acquisitions  we identified in process research and development projects in areas for which technological feasibility have not been established and no alternative future use existed 
the in process research and development charge of million in fiscal was related to the acquisition of fillfactory and the million charge in fiscal was related to our equity method investment in sunpower 
for the acquisition of fillfactory  in process research and development projects include the development of new image sensors in fillfactory s custom and standard product applications 
specifically  the custom products include industrial  automotive  medical and high end photography  and the standard products include high end photography  digital still cameras and wireless terminal cameras 
in assessing the projects  we considered key characteristics of the technology as well as its future prospects  the rate of technology changes in the industry  product life cycles  and various projects stage of development 
we allocated million of the purchase price to the in process research and development projects and wrote off the amount in the third quarter of fiscal as technology feasibility has not been established and no alternative future uses existed 
the value of in process research and development was determined using the income approach method  which calculated the sum of the discounted future cash flows attributable to the projects once commercially viable using discount rates ranging from to  which was derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect the stage of completion of the projects and the level of risks associated with the projects 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined by identifying the research and development expenses invested in the project as a ratio of the total estimated development costs required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the following table summarizes certain information of each significant project as of the acquisition date estimated stage total estimated estimated projects of completion costs to complete completion dates in thousands industrial digital still and wireless terminal cameras medical automotive high end photography to date  there have been no significant differences between the actual and estimated results of the in process research and development projects 
as of january   we have incurred total costs of approximately million to date related to the in process research and development projects and estimate that an additional investment of approximately million will be required to complete the projects 
we expect to complete the remaining projects within the timeframe as originally estimated 
the development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to factors including the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and competitive threats 
the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

table of contents other charges credits during fiscal  in connection with the construction of a facility  we entered into a tax abatement agreement with a development agency  which called for job creation and capital investment by us in return for a reduction in certain local taxes payable 
we were not able to fulfill certain terms of the agreement 
accordingly  at the time it became probable that certain terms of the agreement would not be met  we recorded an accrual of million  representing amounts payable under the agreement 
we never received any claim for repayment from the development agency 
at the end of fiscal  we determined that given the passage of time  there was a remote likelihood that the development agency would seek reimbursement of the amounts payable 
as a result  we reversed the accrual of million and recorded the amount as a credit in the consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal  we decided to halt the construction of our facility and recorded an accrual of million  representing primarily the cancellation penalties payable to suppliers 
subsequently  no claims were made against us by the suppliers 
during fiscal  we determined that the passage of time had made the likelihood of us being obligated to make these payments remote 
as a result  we reversed the accrual of million and recorded the amount as a credit in the consolidated statement of operations 
other charges of million were related to certain abandoned fixed assets 
restructuring the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in demand for  and supply of  semiconductors 
in some cases  industry downturns have lasted more than a year 
prior experience has shown that restructuring of operations  resulting in significant restructuring charges  may become necessary if an industry downturn persists 
as of january   we had two active restructuring plans one initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan and one initiated in the third quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan 
we recorded initial restructuring charges under the fiscal restructuring plan and the fiscal restructuring plan based on assumptions that we deemed appropriate for the economic environment that existed at the time these estimates were made 
as the semiconductor industry we operate in is subject to rapid change  cyclical patterns and high volatility  we have taken additional actions and made appropriate adjustments for property and equipment  leased facilities and personnel costs under both the fiscal restructuring plan and the fiscal restructuring plan 
the restructuring actions were aimed to reduce our future operating expenses and improve our cash flows primarily as a result of reduced employee expenses and reduced depreciation due to the removal of equipment 
as of december   both restructuring events have been substantially completed with reserves remaining only for restructured leased facilities and employee benefits 
as of january   reserves remained for restructured leased facilities  which will decrease over time as we continue to make lease payments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k for a detailed discussion of the two restructuring events 

table of contents other income and expense the following table summarizes the components of other income and expense year ended january  december  december  in thousands interest income interest expense other income and expense  net total interest income and expense and other interest income interest income consisted primarily of interest earned on cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted investments 
in addition  interest income included interest income related to our loans to employees under the employee stock purchase assistance plan 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in interest income related to our employee stock purchase assistance plan due to lower loan balances  partially offset by an million increase in interest income due to an increase in average cash and investment balances 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to lower loan balances related to our employee stock purchase assistance plan  coupled with lower average cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was primarily associated with our convertible subordinated notes 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in interest expense associated with our convertible subordinated notes notes and convertible subordinated notes notes 
we redeemed a portion of our notes and all of our notes in june and july  resulting in a decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease in interest expense associated with our notes and notes in fiscal was partially offset by an increase of approximately million in interest expense associated with our convertible subordinated notes notes 
we issued our notes in june during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we redeemed all of the outstanding notes 
there was no gain or loss upon redemption 
interest expense decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to the redemption of our notes and notes in june and july  partially offset by additional interest expense associated with our notes issued in june

other income  net for fiscal consisted primarily of our gain on the sale of an investment in nve corporation  offset by our loss on the repurchase of our notes and notes and amortization of deferred financing costs 
other expense  net for fiscal consisted primarily of write downs of investments in certain development stage companies and the amortization of deferred financing costs 
these expenses were partially offset by gains recognized on the repurchase of our notes 
during fiscal  we sold our investment in nve corporation  a publicly traded company  and recognized total gains of million from the transactions 
the sales consisted of million shares of nve corporation s common stock in the open market 
the fair market value of the investment was based on the market prices of nve corporation s common stock on the dates of sales  ranging from to per share 
gains on the sales were determined as the difference between the total proceeds of million less the carrying value of our investment of million 
as of january   we held warrants to purchase  shares of nve corporation s common stock at per share  which do not allow for net exercise 
if we exercise the warrants  we will not be allowed to sell the underlying shares in a public market transaction for months 
the warrants will expire in april if not exercised 
investment impairment and other charges for fiscal were primarily attributable to the million write downs of our investments in privately held development stage companies 
our ability to recover our investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute to their business plans and how well their products are ultimately accepted  as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding to continue operations 
we periodically review our investments for impairment and in the event the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis for the investment is established 
this impairment analysis includes assessment of each investee s financial condition  the business prospects for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing  and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or other investors 
during the periods from fiscal to  we made investments in several privately held development stage companies whose valuations subsequently proved to be high 
as the equity markets continued to decline 
table of contents significantly  these development stage companies were either unable to raise additional funding and therefore forced to cease operations  or were able to obtain additional funding but at a valuation lower than the carrying amount of our investments 
as the carrying amount of these investments exceeded their fair value and we determined that the decline in values was other than temporary  we recorded impairment charges of million  which represented the total amount of the write downs to the fair value of our remaining investment in each respective investee 
for those investees who ceased operations  the fair value of our investment was zero  and for those investees who have obtained additional funding at a lower valuation than the carrying amount of our investments  the fair value was based on the new share price of the additional funding 
benefit from provision for income taxes a tax benefit of million was recognized in fiscal  compared to tax expense of million in fiscal and tax expense of million in fiscal the tax benefit in fiscal was primarily attributable to a release of million of previously accrued taxes as discussed below  offset by foreign income taxes in certain jurisdictions 
the expense in fiscal and was largely attributable to foreign income taxes in certain jurisdictions 
no tax benefit was recognized in fiscal and for the future tax benefit of operating losses  as management believed it was more likely than not that the benefit would not be realized 
our effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate primarily due to our assessment of the utilization of loss carryovers and earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates 
the net deferred tax assets of million at january  were fully reserved due to uncertainty of realization in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we regularly assess our tax positions in light of legislative  bilateral tax treaty  regulatory and judicial developments in the many countries in which we and our affiliates do business 
we and our affiliates file tax returns in each jurisdiction in which we are registered to do business 
in the us and many of the state jurisdictions  and in many foreign countries in which we file tax returns  a statute of limitations period exists 
after a statute of limitations period expires  the respective tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period 
similarly  we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the statute of limitations expired for several tax jurisdictions 
the expiration of the statute of limitations led to management s assessment that the previously accrued income taxes were no longer necessary 
accordingly  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a benefit of million for the reversal of previously accrued income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our cash and investments  working capital and long term debt as of january  december  december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments restricted cash long term investments working capital long term debt excluding current portion we had available for sale investments classified as long term investments in fiscal and prior years

these uses of cash were partially offset by the collection of loans from employees under the stock purchase assistance plan of million 
during fiscal  we used million to redeem the remaining notes 
this was partially offset by million from the issuance of shares upon exercise of stock options by employees 
during fiscal  cash generated from operations was million  compared with million in fiscal this million increase was primarily due to a smaller net loss in fiscal  adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash generated from operations included an increase in working capital of million 
inventory reductions due to increased sales were more than offset by a significant increase in accounts receivable and a significant decrease in accounts payable 
purchases of investments  net of sales and maturities  used cash of million in fiscal  as we made additional investments due to our improved cash position 
acquisition of property  plant  and equipment used an additional million in cash 
these reductions in cash were partially offset by an increase from sale of our investment in nve corporation of million and the collection of loans from employees under the stock purchase assistance plan of million 
during fiscal  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our notes 
of the proceeds received  we used million to retire all of our notes and a portion of our notes  million to repurchase million shares of our common stock  million for debt issuance costs and million to purchase a call spread option on our common stock to mitigate the potential dilution of the notes 
during fiscal  cash generated from operations was million  which resulted from our net loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash generated from operations included an increase in working capital of million 
with continued weak sales  manufacturing capacity was reduced to avoid additional inventory builds 
accounts payable declined as we significantly slowed purchases of capital equipment in the latter part of fiscal these changes were partially offset by a decline in net accounts receivable commensurate with the change in revenues 
net of purchases  sales and maturities of investments generated million in cash in fiscal  as we liquidated investments to fund capital expenditures and business acquisitions 
this was offset by the acquisition of million in property  plant and equipment and million in investments in other companies

as of january   we were in compliance with these covenants 
if we failed to be in compliance with these covenants beyond any applicable grace period  the trustee of the notes  or the holders of a specific percentage thereof  would have the ability to demand immediate payment of all amounts outstanding 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we called for redemption all of our outstanding notes at total costs of million  which included outstanding principal of million and accrued interest of million 
in conjunction with our notes offering  we purchased a call spread option on million of our common shares expiring in july for million in cash 
the call spread option was designed to mitigate stock dilution from conversion of the notes 
the call spread option was restructured in may into a single contract of two equal parts maturing on august and september  as of each of the maturity dates  the call spread option was out of the money and expired 
the expiration of the call spread option had no impact on our cash balances or statement of operations in fiscal on june   we entered into a synthetic operating lease agreement for us manufacturing and office facilities 
the lease agreement requires us to purchase the properties or to arrange for the properties to be acquired by a third party at lease expiration 
if we had exercised our right to purchase all the properties subject to these leases at january   we would have been required to make a payment and record assets totaling million 
we are required to maintain restricted cash or investments to serve as collateral for these leases 
as of january   the amount of restricted cash was million  which was classified as a non current asset in the consolidated balance sheets 
in september  we entered into a million  month revolving line of credit with a major financial institution 
in december  this line of credit was extended to december and the total amount was increased to million 
as of january   million was outstanding 
loans made under the line of credit bear interest based upon the wall street journal prime rate or libor plus a spread at our election 
the line of credit agreement includes a variety of covenants including restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness  incurrence of loans  the payment of dividends or distribution on our capital stock  and transfers of assets and financial covenants with respects to tangible net worth and a quick ratio 
as of january   we were in compliance with all of the covenants 
our obligations under the line of credit are guaranteed and secured by the common stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
we intend to use the line of credit on an as needed basis to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
at january  we had long term loan agreements primarily with two lenders with an aggregate principal amount equal to million 
these agreements are collateralized by specific equipment located at our us manufacturing facilities 
principal amounts are to be repaid in monthly installments inclusive of accrued interest  over a three to four year period 
the applicable interest rates are variable based on changes to libor rates 
both loans are subject to financial and non financial covenants 
as of january   the aggregate principal outstanding was million and we were in compliance with the covenants 

table of contents on august   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding capital stock of fillfactory 
we acquired fillfactory for a total cash consideration of million  net of cash received 
several of our acquisitions obligate us to pay certain contingent cash compensation based on continued employment and meeting certain revenue project milestones 
as of january   total contingent compensation that could be paid in cash under our acquisition agreements assuming all contingencies are met was million 
capital resources and financial condition our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
accordingly  at the end of fiscal  in addition to the million in cash and cash equivalents  we had million invested in short term investments that are available for current operating  financing and investing activities  for a total liquid cash and investment position of million 
we had an additional million of restricted cash related to our synthetic lease for a total cash  investment and restricted cash position of million 
as of january   we had outstanding million in principal amount of our notes 
we also maintain the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately million in debt  equity and other securities under a shelf registration statement we filed with the securities and exchange commission in fiscal we believe that liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents  investments  and our borrowing arrangements described above and cash generated from operations  will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  should prevailing economic conditions and or financial  business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements including our debt obligations  we would be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if needed  would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position  facilitate growth  and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities that arise 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations payments due by periods less than more than total year years years years in thousands debt convertible subordinated notes notes principal notes interest other principal other interest operating leases synthetic lease other purchase obligations customer advances total contractual obligations 
table of contents purchase obligations represent principally our open purchase orders for services  software  manufacturing equipment and facilities 
purchase orders for raw materials and other similar goods and services are not included 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations are defined as enforceable agreements that are legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including quantity  price and timing 
our purchase orders for raw materials and other similar goods and services are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other similar goods and services specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
blanket purchase orders are also excluded because they generally represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
customer advances were related to a financing and supply agreement and certain custom design contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease on june   we entered into a synthetic operating lease agreement for manufacturing and office facilities located in minnesota and california 
the synthetic lease enables us to lease rather than acquire the facilities 
this results in improved cash flow through lower lease payments compared to expending much more cash in a direct acquisition of the properties 
the synthetic lease requires us to purchase the properties or to arrange for the properties to be acquired by a third party at lease expiration  which is in june if we had exercised our right to purchase all the properties subject to the synthetic lease at january   we would have been required to make a payment and record assets totaling million the termination value 
if we had exercised our option to sell the properties to a third party  the proceeds from such a sale could be less than the properties termination value  and we would be required to pay the difference up to the guaranteed residual value of million the guaranteed residual value 
we are required to evaluate periodically the expected fair value of the properties at the end of the lease term 
in the event we determine that it is estimable and probable that the expected fair value of the properties at the end of the lease term will be less than the termination value  we will ratably accrue the loss over the remaining lease term 
during fiscal  we performed the analysis and recorded a loss contingency of approximately million in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet relating to the potential decline in the fair value of the facilities in california 
the loss accrual was determined by management with the assistance of a market analysis performed by an independent appraisal firm 
the synthetic lease agreements require periodic payments that vary based on the libor rate  plus a spread 
the total amount of such payments which reflect payments under the existing synthetic lease and prior synthetic leases which have been terminated were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we are required to maintain restricted cash or investments to serve as collateral for this lease 
as of january   the amount of restricted cash recorded was million and was classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of january   we were in compliance with the financial covenants 
options as of january   we had outstanding a series of equity options on our common stock with an initial cost of million that were originally entered into in fiscal these options were included in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k 
we entered into the equity options as part of our stock repurchase program 
depending upon our common stock price at the maturity date of the 
table of contents equity options  we either take delivery of our common stock resulting in a reduction to our outstanding common stock or receive cash resulting in a return on the cash expended 
in conjunction with the issuance of the notes  we purchased a call spread option on our common stock the call spread option maturing on july  for million in cash 
the call spread option has been accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the call spread option covered million shares of our common stock 
the call spread option was designed to mitigate dilution from conversion of the notes 
the call spread option was restructured in may into a single contract of two equal parts maturing on august  and september   respectively 
as of each of the maturity dates  the call spread option was out of the money and expired 
the expiration of the call spread option had no impact on our cash balances or operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and the data used to prepare them 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and employee loans  inventories  valuation of long lived assets including intangibles  goodwill impairments  investment impairments  restructuring charges  litigation and settlement costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue by selling products to original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
our policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when titles and the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable  and customer acceptance and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we offer price protection and similar rights to certain us based distributors 
in addition  we provide limited stock rotation rights to these distributors 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other price protection credits to these distributors  revenues and costs relating to the distributor sales are deferred  on a gross basis  until such rights lapse  which is generally upon receiving notifications from the distributors that they have resold the products 
our method of deferral is based on certain assumptions 
reserves are provided for estimated returns relating to rights of return and other credits for price protection 
if actual results differ from our estimates  operating results could be adversely affected 
sales to certain other primarily non us based distributors carry no price adjustments or rights of return 
we have historically recognized revenue from sales to these distributors on shipment  with a related allowance for potential returns established at the time of sale 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
in that regard  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of 
table of contents our reported revenue may result 
we provide for these situations based on our experience with specific customers and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
at january  and december   our reserves for sales returns were million and million  respectively 
our principal post shipment obligations to our customers are rights to limited stock rotation to our us based distributors as discussed above  and quality related issues for which a warranty reserve is provided by us 
in addition  we provide a volume pricing discount to certain contract manufacturers  which is recorded as a reduction in revenue 
such volume discounts have not been significant historically 
allowance for doubtful accounts and employee loans we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million as of both january  and december  as of january  and december   we had outstanding loans  consisting of principal and cumulative accrued interest  of million and million  respectively  to employees and former employees under the shareholder approved employee stock purchase assistance plan 
each loan is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and is secured by a pledge of the shares of our common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
as of january  and december   we had an allowance for uncollectible accounts against these accounts of million and million  respectively 
in determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts  management considered various factors  including a review of borrower demographics including geographic location and job grade  loan quality and an independent fair value analysis of the loans and the underlying collateral 
as of january  and december   the carrying value of the loans exceeded the underlying common stock collateral by million and million  respectively 
if the underlying assumptions supporting our reserve requirements  including the value of our stock price  change  future operating results could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventory we write down our inventory for lower of cost or market reserves  aged inventory reserves and obsolescence reserves 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a device exceeds nine months of demand for that device and or when individual parts have been in inventory for greater than six months 
inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
our inventories represent high technology parts that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs 
conversely  if demand grows for items that have been fully reserved  our future margins may be higher 
valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
in addition  we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  
table of contents and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses 
we recorded million of impairment charges related to certain intangible assets in fiscal and no impairment charges in fiscal and if there is a significant decrease in our business in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges in the future 
goodwill impairment we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses with recognized goodwill  we made estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
our cash flow forecasts were based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in addition  we made certain judgments about allocating shared assets such as accounts receivable and inventory to the estimated balance sheet for those businesses 
we also considered our market capitalization on the dates of our impairment tests in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective in the beginning of fiscal  we completed the required transitional analysis in the first quarter of fiscal with no impairment charge required 
in addition  as required by sfas no 
 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no goodwill impairment existed for fiscal and  and recorded goodwill impairment charges of million for fiscal however  changes in these estimates  including projected cash flows of our market capitalization  could cause one or more of the businesses to be valued differently  which could result in a future impairment of our remaining goodwill 
investments in privately held companies as of january   the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in non marketable equity securities privately held companies totaled million 
our ability to recover our investments in private  non marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute to their business plans and how well their products are ultimately accepted  as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding to continue operations and to grow 
in the current equity market environment  their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers and private sales  is significantly constrained 
under our accounting policy  the carrying value of a non marketable investment is the amount paid for the investment unless it has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
we review all of our investments periodically for impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment 
this analysis includes assessment of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise  for example  when we hold contractual rights that give us a preference over the rights of other investors 
as the equity markets have declined significantly over the past few years  we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities 
if equity market conditions do not improve  as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds  the funds may not be available to them  or they may receive lower valuations  with more onerous investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments will likely become impaired 
however  we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future  or the extent or timing of individual impairments 
we recorded impairments of non marketable equity investments of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
table of contents restructuring expenses we currently have two active restructuring plans one initiated in the third quarter of fiscal and the other initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  we have announced a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal these plans were designed to reduce costs and expenses in order to return the company to profitability 
in connection with these plans  we have recorded  and will record  estimated expenses for severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
litigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such litigation  we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs 
accounting for income taxes our global operations involve manufacturing  research and development and selling activities 
profit from non us activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to us tax until repatriated to the us it is our intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to us companies  provided certain criteria are met 
fsp no 
provides accounting and disclosure guidance on the impact of the repatriation provision on a company s income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
we are currently studying the impact of the one time favorable foreign dividend provision and intend to complete the analysis by the end 
table of contents of fiscal accordingly  we have not adjusted our income tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the tax impact of any repatriation of non us earnings we may make 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
under sfas no 
r  companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services 
share based compensation arrangements include stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
public companies will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  the company expects to adopt sfas no 
r beginning the third quarter of fiscal sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
we are currently evaluating which method to adopt 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were zero in fiscal  and  respectively 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating sfas no 
and do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating sfas no 
and do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on recording other than temporary impairments of cost method investments and requires additional disclosures for those investments 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf issue no 
 however  the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ended after june  we will evaluate the impact of eitf issue no 
once final guidance is issued 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest and foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
an increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
the majority of our revenues  expenses and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily euro and japanese yen 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established cash flow and balance sheet hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
during fiscal  we entered into a series of euro forward contracts to hedge expected cash flow from one of our subsidiaries 
the total notional amount of the contracts was million 
if the forecasted cash flow fails to materialize  we will have to close out the contracts at the then prevailing market rates  resulting in gains or losses 
a unfavorable currency movement would result in approximately a million loss on these contracts 
all of the potential changes noted above were based on sensitivity analyses performed on our balances as of january  equity options at january   we had outstanding a series of equity options on our common stock with an initial cost of million which was classified in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contracts require physical settlement and the expiration date will be april upon expiration of the options  if our stock price is above the threshold price of per share  we will receive a settlement value totaling million 
if our stock price is below the threshold price of per share  we will receive million shares of our common stock 
alternatively  the contracts may be renewed and extended 
during fiscal and  we received total premiums of million and million  respectively  upon extensions of the contracts 
the amounts were recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets 
in conjunction with the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes notes in june  we purchased a call spread option the call spread option on million of our common shares expiring in july for million 
the call spread option was designed to mitigate stock dilution from conversion of the notes 
the call spread option was restructured in may into a single contract of two equal parts maturing on august and september  as of each of the maturity dates  the call spread option was out of the money and expired 
the expiration of the call spread option had no impact on our cash balances or operating results in fiscal investments in privately held companies we have invested in several privately held companies  all of which can be considered in the startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as of january   the carrying value of our investments in development stage companies was million 
as our equity investments generally do not permit us to exert significant influence or control over the entity in which we are investing  these amounts generally represent our cost of the investment  less any adjustments we make when we determine that an investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost 

table of contents the process of assessing whether a particular equity investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of judgment 
in making this judgment  we carefully consider the investee s cash position  projected cash flows both short and long term  financing needs  most recent valuation data  the current investing environment  management ownership changes  and competition 
this evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure and audit requirements as the reports required of us public companies  and as such  the reliability and accuracy of the data may vary 
based on our evaluation  we recorded impairment charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  as we deemed the decline in values was other than temporary 
estimating the net realizable value of investments in privately held early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to volatility in our reported results of operations and we may in the future incur additional impairments to our equity investments in privately held companies 
stock purchase assistance plan at the end of fiscal  other current assets included million of principal and cumulative accrued interest relating to employees and former employees under the shareholder approved employee stock purchase assistance plan 
we made the loans to employees for the purpose of purchasing our common stock 
each loan is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and is secured by a pledge of the shares of our common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
the primary benefit to us from this program is increased employee retention 
in accordance with the plan  the chief executive officer and the board of directors do not participate in this program 
to date  there have been immaterial write offs 
as of january   we had an allowance for uncollectible accounts against these loans of million 
in determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts  management considered various factors  including a review of borrower demographics including geographic location and job grade  loan quality and an independent fair value analysis of the loans and the underlying collateral 
as of january   the carrying value of the loans exceeded the underlying common stock collateral by million 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we instituted a program directed at minimizing losses as a result of our common stock price fluctuations 
under this program  either a limit sale order or a stop loss order is placed on the common stock purchased by each employee with the loan proceeds once the common stock price exceeds that employee s break even point 
if the common stock price reaches the sale limit order or declines to the stop loss price  the common stock purchased by the employee under the plan will be automatically sold and the proceeds utilized to repay the employee s outstanding loan to us
