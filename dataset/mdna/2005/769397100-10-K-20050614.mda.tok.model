critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified three policies  that due to judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights msr s and the impairment of investments 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussions and analysis contained herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in particular  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  describes generally the company s accounting policies and note  mortgage servicing rights provides details used in valuing the company s msr s and the effect of changes to certain assumptions 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is provided based upon management s continuing analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes techniques to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
the appropriate allowance level is estimated based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
mortgage servicing rights the company stratifies its msr s based on the predominant characteristics of the underlying financial assets including coupon interest rate and contractual maturity of the mortgage 
an estimated fair value of msr s is determined quarterly using a discounted cash flow model 
the model estimates the present value of the future net cash flows of the servicing portfolio based on various factors  such as servicing costs  servicing income  expected prepayments speeds  discount rate  loan maturity and interest rate 
the effect of changes in market interest rates on estimated rates of loan prepayments represents the predominant risk characteristic underlying the msr s portfolio 
the company s methodology for estimating the fair value of msr s is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
for example  the determination of fair value uses anticipated prepayment speeds 
actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on the fair value 
thus  any measurement of msr s fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions made as of the date made 
those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied to a different time 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan is paid off earlier than anticipated 
moreover  since most loans within the servicing portfolio do not contain penalty provisions for early payoff  the company will not receive a corresponding economic benefit if the loan pays off earlier than expected 
msr s are the discounted present value of the future net cash flows projected from the servicing portfolio 
accordingly  prepayment risk subjects the company s msr s to impairment 
msr s impairment is recorded in the amount that the estimated fair value is less than the msr s carrying value on a strata by strata basis 
investment valuation the company s determination of impairment for various types of investments accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
is predicated on the notion of other than temporary 
the key indicator that an investment may be impaired is that the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value 
each reporting period  the company reviews those investments the fair value is less than carrying value 
the review includes determining whether certain indicators indicated the fair value of the investment has been negatively impacted 
these indicators include deteriorating financial condition  regulatory  economic or technological changes  downgrade by a rating agency and length of time the fair value has been less than carrying value 
if any indicators of impairment are present  management determines the fair value of the investment and compares this to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  the investment is considered impaired a nd a determination must be made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
securities held to maturity are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized in interest income using the interest method 
if the cost basis of these securities is determined to be other than temporary impaired  the amount of the impairment is charged to operations 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value 
premiums and discounts are amortized using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity 
unrealized holding gains and losses  or valuation allowances established for net unrealized losses  are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income taxes  unless the security is deemed other than temporary impaired 
if the security is determined to be other than temporary impaired  the amount of the impairment is charged to operations 
the company s underlying principle in determining whether impairment is other than temporary is an impairment shall be deemed other than temporary unless positive evidence indicating that an investment s carrying value is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs negative evidence to the contrary 
evidence that is objectively determinable and verifiable is given greater weight than evidence that is subjective and or not verifiable 
evidence based on future events will generally be less objective as it is based on future expectations and therefore is generally less verifiable or not verifiable at all 
factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary include  a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and c the company s intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time 
in situations in which the security s fair value is below amortized cost but it continues to be probable that all contractual terms of the security will be satisfied  and that the decline is solely attributable to changes in interest rates not because of increased credit risk  and the company asserts that it has positive intent and ability to hold that security to maturity  no other than temporary impairment is recognized 
operating strategy in the fiscal year ended march   the company began to implement a growth strategy to broaden its products and services from those of a traditional thrift to those more closely related to commercial banking 
the growth strategy included four elements geographic and product expansion  loan portfolio diversification  development of relationship banking and maintenance of asset quality 
since the end of fiscal  the company has added three branches including the branch in downtown vancouver 
in addition  the july acquisition of today s bancorp  inc added one branch and a lending center 
the washougal branch was relocated to a new facility  and the stevenson  white salmon and goldendale branches were remodeled 
the number of automated teller machines increased from six to so that each branch location now is serviced by at least one automated teller machine 
the company s growing commercial customer base has enjoyed new products and the improvements in existing products 
these new products include business checking  internet banking and new loan products 
retail customers have benefited from expanded choices ranging from additional automated teller machines  consumer lending products  checking accounts  debit cards  hour account information service and internet banking 
fiscal marked the nd anniversary since the bank opened its doors in the historical emphasis has been on residential real estate lending  however  the company began diversifying its loan portfolio through the expansion of commercial loans in in fiscal  the company had four experienced commercial lenders and currently there are seven commercial lenders who are expanding the commercial lending services available to the company s customers 
in fiscal  commercial loans including commercial real estate as a percentage of the loan portfolio were  which has increased to of total loans at the end of fiscal year commercial lending including commercial real estate has higher credit risk  wider interest margins and shorter loan terms than residential lending which can increase the loan portfolio profitability 
the company s relationship banking has been enhanced by the addition of riverview asset management corp  a trust company directed by experienced trust officers  through expanded loan products serviced by experienced commercial and consumer lending officers  and an expanded branch network led by experienced branch managers 
development of relationship banking has been the key to the company s growth 
the fair market value of assets under management has increased from million at march   to million at march  net interest income the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income it receives on interest earning assets and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is also affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets equal or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the level of non interest income and expenses also affects the company s profitability 
non interest income includes deposit service fees  income associated with the origination and sale of mortgage loans  brokering loans  loan servicing fees  income from real estate owned  net gains and losses on sales of interest earning assets  bank owned life insurance income and asset management fee income 
non interest expenses include compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  deposit insurance premiums  data servicing expenses and other operating costs 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government legislation and regulation  and monetary and fiscal policies 
comparison of financial condition at march  and at march   the company had total assets of million compared with million at march  the increase in total assets was primarily as a result of the increase in loans outstanding 
cash  including interest earning accounts  totaled million at march   compared to million at march   as a result of the company s increase in total deposits 
loans receivable  net  were million at march   compared to million at march   a increase 
the increases in commercial real estate  commercial construction  land  and consumer loans were partially offset by decreases in one to four family residential  multi family  construction one to four family  and multi family construction loans 
decreases in one to four family residential loans reflect managements decision to sell fixed interest rate mortgages and retain adjustable rate interest rate mortgages in the loan portfolio 
as interest rates fall  loan volume shifts to fixed rate production 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  loan volume will shift to adjustable rate production 
selling fixed interest rate mortgage loans allows the company to reduce the interest rate risk associated with long term fixed interest rate products 
it also provides additional funds for new loans and provides a means for the diversification of the loan portfolio 
the company continues to service the loans it sells  maintaining the customer relationship and generating ongoing non interest income 
a substantial portion of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real estate  either as primary or secondary collateral located in its primary market areas 
investment securities available for sale was million at march   compared to million at march  the decrease reflects pay downs of million and the fiscal year third quarter impairment write down on freddie mac and fannie mae of million and the subsequent sale of these securities during the fourth quarter with outstanding balances of million 
during the first and fourth quarter of fiscal year million of agencies bonds were purchased by the company 
mortgage backed securities held to maturity was million at march   compared to million at march  the  decrease was a result of pay downs 
mortgage backed securities available for sale was million at march   compared to million at march  the million decrease was a result of pay downs 
deposit accounts totaled million at march  compared to million at march  the increase in deposits is primarily a result of the increases in certificates of deposit and non interest bearing account balances 
checking accounts and money market accounts transaction accounts total average outstanding balance increased to million at march   compared to million at march  transaction accounts represented and of average total outstanding balance of deposits at march  and march   respectively 
fhlb advances were million at march  and during the current year the company borrowed and repaid overnight borrowings that totaled million 
shareholders equity increased million to million at march  from million at march  the increase was primarily the result of million total comprehensive income   earned esop shares and  exercise of stock options  offset by million of cash dividends paid to shareholders 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and net income 
net income was million  or per diluted share for the year ended march   compared to million  or per diluted share for the year ended march  net interest income 
net interest income for fiscal year was million  representing a million  or a increase  from million in fiscal year this improvement reflected an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets primarily as a result of increases in the average balance of mortgage and non mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of daily interest bearing assets to million  which was offset by a increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities an increase in all deposit categories and a  increase in fhlb borrowings to million 
the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities increased to in fiscal from in fiscal which indicates that the interest earning asset growth is being funded less by interest bearing liabilities as compared to capital a nd non interest bearing demand deposits 
interest income 
interest income was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million  for the fiscal year ended average interest bearing assets increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the yield on interest earning assets was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal the increased yield is the primarily the result of the higher yields on investment securities and daily interest earning assets that reflect the increases in interest rates that occurred during fiscal year the increased interest income is the result of the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets and the increase in the yield on interest earning assets 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended march  totaled million  an  increase from million for the year ended march  the increase in interest expense is the result of higher rates of interest that occurred during fiscal years and the weighted average interest rate of total deposits increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the weighted average interest rate of fhlb borrowings increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the level of liquidity in fiscal year allowed the runoff of high interest rate deposits acquired in the acquisition of today s bancorp and held fhlb borrowings at million 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended march  was  compared to  for the year ended march  the provision for loan losses increased during the year ended march  as net charge offs decreased to  from million in fiscal year net charge offs to average net loans was for fiscal year as compared to for prior year 
non accrual loans continued to decrease from million at march  to  at march  the allowance for loan losses was million at march  compared to million at march  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total net loans was at march  compared to at march  the quality of the loan portfolio continues to increase as the criticized classified loan balances have decreased by million and non accrual loans decreased by  at march  compared to march  the mix o f the loan portfolio reflected an increase in the balances of commercial real estate loans  and construction  and consumer loans at march  as compared to balances at march  the loan loss rates for consumer and construction other loans were increased by basis points  speculative construction and multi family loans were increased by basis points  land and lots loans were increased by basis points and commercial real estate loans were decreased by basis points during fiscal year in order to reflect the risk of loss 
management considered the allowance for loan losses at march  to be adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio 
the company establishes a general reserve for loan losses through a periodic provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio and current economic conditions 
the provisions for loan losses are based on management s estimate of net realizable value or fair value of the collateral  as applicable  and the company s actual loss experience  and standards applied by the ots and the fdic 
the company regularly reviews its loan portfolio  including non performing loans  to determine whether any loans require classification or the establishment of appropriate reserves 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require the company to provide additions to the allowance for loan losses based upon judgments different from those of management 
the allowance for loan losses is provided based upon management s continuing analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
this detailed analysis includes techniques to estimate the fair value of the loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves subjective judgments regarding future event s  and thus there can be no assurance those additional provisions for credit losses will not be required in future periods 
although management uses the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary as a result of economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
any increase or decrease in the provision for loan losses may have a corresponding negative or positive effect on the company s net income 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the same period in excluding the million net impairment charge of investment securities and subsequent gain on sale  non interest income increased million or for the year ended march  when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in loan servicing income for fiscal year reflects the  decrease in servicing amortization as the servicing portfolio has decreased 
it also reflects a  increase in market valuation of mortgage servicing right compared to the  increase in market valuation of mortgage servicing rights in fiscal for the year ended march   fees and service charges increased  or  when compared to the year ended march  the  increase in fees and service charges is primarily a result of the  or  growth in mortgage broker fe es and a  increase in fees from deposit services in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the increase in the number of mortgage brokers from nine to ten in fiscal year combined with the mortgage interest rates experienced in fiscal increased the volume of mortgage refinance activity as compared to the mortgage refinance activity in fiscal the increased mortgage refinance activity resulted in increased mortgage broker activity 
the reduced gains on sale of loans held for sale reflected the mortgage broker activity having a higher proportion of brokered loans versus portfolio loans 
mortgage brokered loan production increased from million in to million in mortgage broker fees included in fees and service charges totaled million for the year ended march  compared to million for the previous year 
mortgage broker commission compensation expense was million for the fiscal ended march  compared to  for the f iscal ended march  asset management services income was million for the fiscal year compared to  for the fiscal year riverview asset management corp 
had million in total assets under management at march  compared to million at march  in first quarter of fiscal year the camas branch and operations center was sold and leased back resulting in a gain of  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year one measure of a bank s ability to contain non interest expense is the efficiency ratio  which is calculated by dividing total non interest expense less intangible asset amortization by the sum of net interest income plus non interest income less intangible asset amortization  lower of cost or market adjustments and securities impairment charge 
the company s efficiency ratio excluding intangible asset amortization  lower cost or market adjustments and securities impairment charge was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the principle component of the company s non interest expense is salaries and employee benefits 
for the year ended march   salaries and employee benefits  which includes mortgage broker commission compensation  was million  an increase over the prior year total of million 
salaries also increased as the number of full time equivalent employees increased to at march  from at march   which was primarily the result of the expansion related to increased staffing in branches and operations 
the acquisition of today s bancorp and the related acquisition of million in deposit accounts created an  core deposit intangibles cdi  representing the excess of cost over fair market of the acquired deposits 
the cdi is being amortized over a ten year life using an accelerated amortization method 
the amortization expense was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the acquisition of the hazel dell and longview branches from the resolution trust corporation in fiscal see item properties  and the related acquisition of million in customer deposits created a million core deposit intangible asset  representing the excess of fair value of deposits over the acquired cost 
cdi was  at march  and was fully amortized during the fiscal year the amortization expense of cdi was  for the fiscal year provision for federal income taxes 
the provision for federal income taxes was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the primary reason the tax provision is lower in the current year compared to the prior year is a result of the tax treatment of an increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance

the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal which indicates that the interest earning asset growth is being funded more by interest bearing liabilities as compared to capital and n on interest bearing demand deposits 
interest income 
interest income was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  average interest bearing assets increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the yield on interest earning assets was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal the decreased yield is the primarily the result of the lower yields on loans that reflect decreases in the federal reserve board discount rates that occurred during fiscal years and interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended march  totaled million  a million decrease from million for the year ended march  the decrease in interest expense is the result of lower rates of interest paid on deposits and fhlb borrowings as a result of decreases in the federal reserve board discount rates that occurred during fiscal years and the weighted average interest rate of total deposits decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the weighted average interest rate of fhlb borrowings decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the level of liquidity in fiscal year allowed the runoff of high interest rate deposits acquired in the acquisition of today s bancorp and held fhlb borrowings at million

the allowance for loan losses increased million to million at march  from million at march  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total net loans increased to compared to at march  net charge offs to average net loans for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the increase in the balance of the allowance for loan losses at march  reflects the acquisition of today s bancorp  the proportionate increase in loan balances  the change in mix of loan balances  the increase in substandard assets and a change in loss rate when compared to march  the acquisition of today s bancorp added million to the allowance for loan losses and approximately  of the charge offs was related to loans acquired in the acquisition 
the mix of the loan portfolio showed an increase in the balances of commercial  commercial real estate loans  and construction  and consumer loans at march  as compared to balances at march  substandard assets increased by million to million at march  compared to million at march  the balance of substandard asset of million at march  is a decrease of million from the million balance of substandard assets after the acquisition of today s bancorp 
the loss rate for other mention loans was increased from at march  to at march  in order to reflect the risk of loss 
management considered the allowance for loan losses at march  to be adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio non interest income 
non interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  compared to million for the same period in excluding the fiscal million pretax loss on sale of securities and other than temporary impairment on equity investments  non interest income increased  or  for the year ended march  when compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to the loan servicing income of  for fiscal year compared to a loss of  for fiscal year the increase in loan servicing income for fiscal year reflects the  increase in market valuation of mortgage servicing rights in fiscal as compared to the  write down of mortgage servicing rights in fiscal for the year ended march   fees and service charges increased  or when compared to the year ended march  the  increase in fees and servi ce charges is primarily a result of the  or  growth in fee income from deposit services that was offset by the  decrease in mortgage broker fees in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the rise in mortgage rates experienced in fiscal reduced the volume of mortgage refinance activity as compared to the mortgage finance activity in fiscal the reduced mortgage refinance activity resulted in reduced mortgage broker activity and reduced gains on sale of loans held for sale

the company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets 
interest rate sensitivity will increase by retaining portfolio loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and selling fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans with terms of more than years 
however  the company may originate fixed rate loans for investment when funded with long term funds to mitigate interest rate risk 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuation s because they generally represent a stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms up to ten years 
the company has adopted a strategy that is designed to maintain or improve the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities 
the primary elements of this strategy involve the origination of adjustable rate loans or purchase of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities for its portfolio  increasing commercial  consumer and residential construction loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one to four family residential mortgage loans  matching asset and liability maturities  investing in short term mortgage backed and other securities  and the origination of fixed rate loans for sale in the secondary market and the retention of the related loan servicing rights 
this approach has remained consistent throughout the past year as the company has experienced a change in the mix of loans  deposits and fhlb advances 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect the company s earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect the company s earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of the company s earnings  management has sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
pursuant to this strategy  the company actively originates arm loans for retention in its loan portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loans with terms of more than years generally are originated for the intended purpose of resale in the secondary mortgage market 
the company has also invested in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities to increase the level of short term adjustable assets 
at march   arm loans and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities c onstituted million  or  of the company s total combined mortgage loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio 
this compares to arm loans and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities at march  that totaled million  or  of the company s total combined mortgage loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio 
although the company has sought to originate arm loans  the ability to originate and purchase such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
particularly in lower interest rate environments  borrowers often prefer to obtain fixed rate loans 
the company s mortgage servicing activities provide additional protection from interest rate risk 
the company retains servicing rights on all mortgage loans sold 
as market interest rates rise  the fixed rate loans held in portfolio diminish in value 
however  the value of the servicing portfolio tends to rise as market interest rates increase because borrowers tend not to prepay the underlying mortgages  thus providing an interest rate risk hedge versus the fixed rate loan portfolio 
the loan servicing portfolio totaled million at march   including million of purchased mortgage servicing 
the purchase of loan servicing replaced loan servicing balances extinguished through prepayment of the underlying loans 
the average balance of the servicing portfolio was million and produced loan servicing income of  for the year ended march  see item business lending activities mortgage loan servicing 
consumer loans  commercial loans and construction loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans  and accordingly reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
adjustable interest rate consumer  commercial  construction and other loans totaled million or of total gross loans at march  as compared to million  or  at march  at march   the construction  commercial  consumer and other loan portfolios amounted to million  million  million and million  or   and of total loans  net of deferred fees  respectively

a measure of the company s exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is provided by the test required by ots thrift bulletin no 
a  interest rate risk management 
this test measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
using data compiled by the ots  the company receives a report which measures interest rate risk by modeling the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
this procedure for measuring interest rate risk was developed by the ots to replace the gap analysis the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a specific time period 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the following table provides the estimated impacts of immediate changes in interest rates at th e specified levels based on the latest ots report dated december  at december  net portfolio value net portfolio value as a change dollar amount dollar change percent change percent of present value of assets in rates npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp no information is provided because the three month treasury bill was at december  for example  the above table illustrates that an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates at december  would increasillion  or  at that date 
at december   an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates would have increased the company s npv by approximately  or  at that date 
the million increase in the npv to  at december  is the result of the impact of more adjustable loan balances in the loan portfolio at december  as compared to december  certain assumptions used by the ots in assessing the interest rate risk of savings associations within its region were used in preparing the preceding table 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
furthermore  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of cash flows is its operations as a lender  which generate interest income on loans 
this is supplemented by fee income  service charges  and interest on investment securities  and reduced by payment of interest expense and non interest expenses 
after payment of expenses  the company has significant positive cash flow from operating activities 
the company s investing activities typically use cash  primarily for loan originations 
for the year ended march   additional cash flows were provided by the company s financing activities as a result of a significant increase in deposit accounts 
the company s primary source of funds are customer deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  the sale of loans  maturing securities and fhlb advances 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  satisfy other financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the company generally maintains sufficient cash and short term investments to meet short term liquidity needs 
at march   cash totaled million  or  of total assets 
the bank has a of total assets line of credit with the fhlb of seattle to the extent the bank provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient fhlb stock 
at march   the bank had million of outstanding advances from the fhlb of seattle under an available credit facility of million  limited to available collateral 
liquidity management is both a short and long term responsibility of the company s management 
the company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of i expected loan demand  ii projected loan sales  iii expected deposit flows  iv yields available on interest bearing deposits and v liquidity of its asset liability management program 
excess liquidity is invested generally in interest bearing overnight deposits and other short term government and agency obligations 
if the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  it has additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb and collateral for borrowing at the federal reserve bank discount window 
at march   the bank s ratio of cash and eligible investments to the sum of withdrawable savings and borrowings due within one year was 
the company s primary investing activity is the origination of loans

certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than on e year from march  totaled million 
historically  the company has been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature

while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  prepayment of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the increase in interest rates during the fiscal year has created an interest rate environment that caused the demand for fixed rate single family loans and repayment of existing single family mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities to be less than in the prior year 
the company s business plan emphasizes the sale of fixed rate mortgages as part of its interest rate risk strategy 
the decrease in the cash flows from operating activities of loans sold to million for the fiscal compared to million for fiscal reflects this strategy under the changing interest rate environment 
the bank has experienced growth in deposit accounts that is attributable to organic growth 
the information contained in item  business deposit activities and other sources of funds deposit flow reflects this net increase in cash flows from deposits of million for fiscal as compared to an million increase in net cash flows for the same period in the prior year 
the higher interest rate certificates of deposit have been allowed to runoff 
should the bank require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional funds are available through the use of fhlb and pacific coast banker s bank borrowings 
at march  advances from fhlb totaled million and the bank had additional borrowing capacity available of million from the fhlb  subject to collateral limitations 
at march  the bank s available borrowing line subject to collateral limitations was million 
the bank has a million fed funds line with pacific coast banker s bank at march  sources of capital and liquidity for the company on a stand alone basis include distributions from the bank and the issuance of debt or equity 
dividends and other capital distributions from the bank are subject to regulatory restrictions 
ots regulations require the bank to maintain specific amounts of regulatory capital 
as of march   the bank complied with all regulatory capital requirements as of that date with tangible  core and risk based capital ratios of  and  respectively

effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

qualitative aspects of market risk 
the company s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while limiting its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the company intends to reduce risk where appropriate but accept a degree of risk when warranted by economic circumstances 
the company has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the mismatch between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets 
interest rate sensitivity will increase by retaining portfolio loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and selling fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans with terms of more than years 
interest rates on residential one to four fami ly mortgage loan applications are typically locked during the application stage for periods ranging from to days  the most typical period being days 
these loans are locked with the fhlmc under a best efforts delivery program 
the company makes every effort to deliver these loans before their rate locks expire 
this arrangement requires the company to deliver the loans to the fhlmc within ten days of funding 
delays in funding the loans can require a lock extension 
the cost of a lock extension at times is borne by the borrower and at times by the company 
these lock extension costs paid by the company are not expected to have a material impact to operations 
this activity is managed daily 
consumer and commercial loans are originated and held in portfolio as the short term nature of these portfolio loans match durations more closely with the short term nature of retail deposits such as now accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts 
the company relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the company promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with longer terms to maturity 
except for immediate short term cash needs  and depending on the current interest rate environment  fhlb advances will usually be of longer term
