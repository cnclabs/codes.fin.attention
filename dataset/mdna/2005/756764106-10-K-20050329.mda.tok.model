item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we operate in four reportable segments hotels and restaurants  franchise  central services and development  entertainment  and real estate 
the hotels and restaurants segment derives revenue primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage operations at our owned and leased hotels and from management fees charged to the owners of our managed hotels 
management fees are typically based on a percentage of the hotel s gross revenues plus an incentive fee based on operating performance 
the franchise  central services and development segment is engaged primarily in licensing our brands to franchisees 
this segment generates revenue from franchise fees that are typically based on a percent of room revenues and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brands and access to our central services programs reservation system  guest loyalty program  national and regional sales  revenue management tools  quality inspections  advertising and brand standards 
the entertainment segment derives revenue primarily from ticketing services and promotion and presentation of entertainment productions 
the real estate segment generates revenue from owning  managing  leasing and developing commercial and multi unit residential properties

table of contents key hotel and restaurant segment revenue data from continuing operations are as follows in thousands year ended december  hotel and restaurant segment revenues room revenues food and beverage revenues amenities and other department revenues management contract revenue total hotel and restaurant segment revenues system wide performance statistics are as follows year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  average average average occupancy adr revpar occupancy adr revpar occupancy adr revpar owned or leased hotels continuing operations discontinued operations combined system wide red lion hotels owned  leased  managed and franchised year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues hotel and restaurant revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  revenue from owned and leased hotels was up million compared to the increase was primarily due to growth of about million in room revenue between comparable periods  or 
occupied rooms increased in compared to and adr is up to 
the resulting revpar from owned and leased hotels that are part of continuing operations was higher than revpar in of 
these increases are partially offset by declines of thousand in food and beverage revenue as compared to  primarily due to the closure of one of our hotel restaurants 
incidental revenues from guest amenities and other sources is also down thousand  primarily related to the closure of one of our hotel gift shops  lower telephone revenue and lower movie rental revenue 
revenue from management of third party hotels  included in this segment  is down million for from million in to thousand in due to a decrease in the number of hotels under management agreements 
was a period of strong growth for us 
demand suffered significantly early in due  in our opinion  to declining business and excursion travel resulting from national economic challenges  personal spending cutbacks and national security threats 
we believe that our operating results reflect that our hotel and restaurants segment began to stabilize during the third quarter of and has continued these positive trends through our occupancy gains during each month of compared to the same periods in substantiate this belief 
these results are typical of the overall national trends 
during the third and fourth quarters of  our revenue results are indicative of better regional demand for mid scale and upper mid scale hotel rooms and our ability to service that demand through our system of hotels 
we also believe the rebranding of hotels from westcoast to red lion hotels  which was completed in the first quarter of  continues to have a positive effect 

table of contents our strategy has been to increase occupancy through strategic marketing and investment in our properties  and then to increase rate as demand increases for our rooms 
our occupancy has now increased year on year for each of the past thirteen calendar months and the resulting demand allowed us to increase the average daily rate during the fourth quarter 
we believe that the combined effect of this strategy is that revpar has increased at a faster rate than many of our direct competitors over the past year 
we continue to receive a higher percentage of our reservations through electronic distribution systems that include our own branded website and third party internet channels alternative distributions system or ads 
our central reservations and distribution management technology allows us to manage the yield on these ads channels on a real time  hotel by hotel basis 
we have fixed charge markup merchant model agreements with nine ads providers  which typically entitle the provider to keep a fixed percentage of the price paid by the customer for each room booked 
this allows us to maximize the yield of a typically lower rated market segment 
our focus on our branded website has made it our single largest source of online reservations  allowing us to further maximize our yield on those types of bookings 
our success is reflective of our management of these ads channels and our merchant model agreements 
during  we experienced higher system wide adr compared to by 
at the same time  our system wide occupancy grew from to between comparative years 
in addition  through we continued to increase bookings as a result of our focus on direct sales  stay comfortable advertising campaign and the we promise or we pay branded website booking initiative 
the we promise or we pay initiative is designed to encourage guests to book on our branded websites of westcoasthotels 
com and redlion 
com 
through this initiative  we guarantee to our guests that our branded websites will provide the lowest rate available compared to non opaque ads channels 
our branded websites have become our single largest source of electronically distributed room revenue 
we increased reservation contribution  measured in terms of revenue  to system hotels over the past year to during from during we also began to see the positive effects of our launch of netguests  our privately labeled wireless internet service during the third quarter of and into the fourth quarter 
netguests provides hotel guests and guestawards frequency program members access to free high speed wireless internet 
in we have initiated our capital improvement program which significantly improved room amenities with new pillow top beds and an upgraded pillows and linens package 
we also launched a marketing campaign geared specifically to increasing awareness of the netguests and room amenity upgrade programs known as stay comfortable 
our brand strengthening initiatives  marketing efforts and technological upgrades are achieving the desired results 
our central reservations system is able to drive more business to our system hotels and a greater percentage of that business is coming through our branded websites 
revenue derived through our branded website yields a higher margin for the system hotels than other electronic distribution sources 
franchise  central services and development revenue for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  net changes in franchise fee income accounted for substantially all of this change  with an average of franchises in place during compared to an average of during entertainment segment revenue increased approximately million  or for the year ended december   to million from million during the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was due to presentation of nine broadway shows during compared to four such shows presented during the remaining increase was primarily due to ticketing income from four new locations we now serve 
real estate revenue from continuing operations is up to million for the year ended december  compared to million for overall  the segment experienced increased revenues from fees earned on three new management and development projects during that were in place for only a portion of it also experienced increased leasing occupancy  and increased management fees for real estate projects 
these improvements were offset by slightly lower commission revenue  fewer achieved percentage rents  and lower rental rates at an owned facility 

table of contents direct expenses in aggregate  direct expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for this represents an increase of million or between periods 
direct expenses include direct operating expenses for each of the operating segments  depreciation  amortization  gain or loss on asset dispositions and conversion expenses  if any 
direct hotels and restaurants segment expenses increased million from million in to million for the year ended december  hotel room related costs were up about million between comparative periods due primarily to labor costs for additional hotel staffing related to higher guest service levels and direct sales efforts  promotional activities  the costs of the netguests program  and the general increased costs associated with higher occupancies 
also  our hotels experienced an overall increase in utility costs  maintenance costs  and sales department related expenses 
medical benefits and worker s compensation costs also contributed to the increase 
food and beverage costs were down thousand  resulting from lower labor costs and the positive effects of our core menu program 
facility and land lease expense is down thousand due to the reduced lease expense from having purchased the yakima and bellevue properties  partially offset by the increase in lease expense related to the sale leaseback of the river inn property discussed below 
direct costs for franchise  central services and development were down thousand between comparative periods due to labor savings and cost containment earlier in the year 
the entertainment segment direct costs increased million in connection with the additional broadway presentations in noted above  reduced profitability in certain operating areas due to non scalable labor costs  increases in ticketing activity requiring more labor  and advertising costs for the broadway season 
real estate segment direct expenses from continuing operations were down thousand on consistent activity between periods 
corporate services direct expenses also remained consistent between periods 
depreciation and amortization increased thousand or between and  for two primary reasons 
the operating results for reflected a depreciation catch up adjustment for certain assets previously held for sale in spokane  washington and kalispell  montana  for which no such adjustment exists for in this was offset by the effect of depreciation on recent capital additions which added to the depreciable base of property and equipment 
for the year ended december   the net gain recognized on asset disposals was million  related to the recognition of deferred gains over time on both a previously sold office building and hotel  and a thousand gain on the sale of undeveloped land in spokane  washington  offset by a loss on the sale of a land parcel in yakima 
in connection with that land sale  we extended our catering agreement with the city of yakima  washington 
the net loss for the year ended december  of thousand was related primarily to the disposition of signage related to the rebranding of of our hotels and the disposition of our interest in a hotel venture  offset by the recognition of deferred gains over time on the office building 
conversion costs in represent expenses incurred unrelated to property and equipment to re brand hotels to the red lion name 
no such costs were incurred in undistributed corporate expenses undistributed corporate expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of thousand was primarily due to higher employee costs and certain corporate insurance costs 
undistributed corporate expense includes general and administrative charges such as corporate payroll  legal expenses  contributions  directors and officers insurance  bank service charges  outside accountants and consultants expense  and investor relations charges 
we consider these expenses to be undistributed because the costs are not directly related to our business segments and therefore are not distributed to those segments 
in contrast  costs more directly related to our business segments such as accounting  human resources and information technology expenses are distributed out to operating segments and are included in direct expenses 

table of contents operating income operating income from continuing operations increased by thousand or from million for to million for during the first two quarters of we experienced a decline in operating income primarily due to increased costs in our operating segments for the reasons previously discussed 
during the third and fourth quarters of operating income rebounded  due to strong revenue increases in our hotel operating segment for the reasons previously discussed  with aggregate costs remaining steady and proportionate to the revenue base 
this rebound more than offset the declines from the first two quarters 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was due to a greater average amount of outstanding interest bearing debt  primarily in connection with the addition of the million of debentures issued during the first quarter of to westcoast hospitality capital trust the trust  a deleware statutory trust sponsored by us 
a majority of the proceeds from the debentures were used to retire our then existing preferred stock and eliminate the ongoing dividend requirement of those securities 
while these new debentures reflect a rate  the interest is tax deductible under current us federal tax law giving them an effective post tax rate of approximately 
the average pre tax interest rate on debt during was versus during in addition to the interest rate on the debentures  a substantial portion of our borrowings carry a pre tax interest rate of for ten years  which management believes is a favorable long term rate 
other income expense the other income and expense line items are comparable between periods and consistent with our long term historical results 
during  we had thousand of loan fee write offs  offset by a contract termination fee of thousand and other miscellaneous net gains 
income taxes income tax benefit on continuing operations for was thousand 
income tax expense for was thousand 
the change of thousand in tax provision was primarily due to increased deductions related to interest on the debentures held by the trust  partially offset by a higher pre tax net income from operations 
net income loss from continuing operations net loss from continuing operations for was thousand  compared to net income from continuing operations for of million 
the lower income was primarily the result of increased interest expense due to the trust preferred offering in the first quarter of  partially offset by stronger performance in our operating segments for the reasons previously discussed 
discontinued operations in connection with our november announcement of plans to invest million to improve comfort  freshen d cor and upgrade technology at our hotels  we implemented a plan to divest of our non strategic owned hotels  one of our real estate office buildings and certain other non core properties collectively referred to as the divestment properties 
the activities of those hotels and the real estate property are considered discontinued operations under generally accepted accounting principles 
we evaluated the divestment properties for potential impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  four of the hotel assets included in the divestment properties were determined to have been impaired  million in aggregate  or million net of the expected income tax benefit of million 
the impairment amount was calculated using expected sales prices  less expected transaction costs  as compared to the carrying value at the 
table of contents date of the evaluation  in november that impairment amount is reflected  net of income tax impact  as part of discontinued operations 
also in november  the hotels and the office building were reclassified as assets held for sale  specifically designated as discontinued operations 
all of the results of operations of these hotels and office building have been reclassified from continued operations to discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
depreciation of these assets  if previously appropriate  has been suspended 
for comparative purposes  for periods prior to the balance sheet and operations activity for the properties considered discontinued has been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
the net impact on consolidated earnings of the activities of the discontinued operations was thousand of net income for the year ended december   including tax impact 
this includes thousand of aggregate net impact from the hotels and thousand of net impact from the office building 
this compares to the year ended december  for which the discontinued operations had a net impact on consolidated earnings of a thousand net loss including tax impact 
the balance includes aggregate activity of the hotels of a thousand net loss and a thousand net income from the office building 
net income loss and loss applicable to common shareholders the net loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to net income of for the year ended december  the lower net income is primarily the result of the million net of tax impairment discussed above  increased interest expense due to the trust preferred offering in the first quarter of  partially offset by stronger performance in our operating segments for the reasons previously discussed 
due to the retirement of all of our series a and series b preferred stock in february  preferred stock dividends decreased million between the and as a result  the increase in interest expense was partially offset by the decrease in preferred stock dividends 
the resulting net loss applicable to common shareholders was million for compared to million for earnings per share the loss per share for was compared to a loss of for the net loss applicable to common shareholders increased million as described above  while the number of weighted average common shares outstanding in both periods remained relatively consistent 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues hotel and restaurant revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  declined by million  or  to million compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to reductions of about million in room revenue and million in food and beverage revenue 
at our owned and leased hotels  adr was in compared to in average occupancy in for owned and leased hotels was versus in the resulting revpar of was lower than although demand suffered significantly in the first and second quarters of due  in our opinion  to declining business and excursion travel resulting from national economic challenges  personal spending cutbacks and certain national security threats  we believe these results reflect that our hotel and restaurants segment began to stabilize during the third quarter 
these results are indicative of the overall national trends 
we expected to experience normal seasonal declines in revenue during the fourth quarter of and were able to reduce the impact of these declines through effective expense management 
also  much of the decline between the fourth quarter of and was due to an anticipated drop in group business due to the fact that a government agency  which had conducted significant training in  did not contribute to group business in 
table of contents we also believe the rebranding of hotels from westcoast to red lion hotels  which was completed in the first quarter of  had a positive effect 
additionally  in the first quarter of  our hotel in salt lake city was positively impacted by the winter olympics 
the lack of similar activity during the first quarter of resulted in a million decrease in comparative revenues 
management fee revenue for the year ended december  declined thousand from this drop was the result of both a decline in the number of hotels managed during the comparable periods  from eleven down to six  and a general decline in the room revenues for the managed properties  on which our management fees are primarily based 
however  these decreases were partially offset by a thousand management agreement termination fee realized during the fourth quarter of we continued to receive a higher percentage of our reservations through third party internet channels in  on which we generally realize lower room rates 
decreases in adr slowed during the third and fourth quarters of  partly reflective of our efforts to control these alternate distribution systems  or ads 
we launched a new pilot ads channel management program in select hotels on august  and have realized positive revenue trends in those properties during the trial period 
we signed fixed charge markup agreements with nine ads providers  which typically entitle the provider to keep a fixed percentage of the price paid by the customer for each room booked 
the central reservations and distribution management technology placed in service during the first and second quarters of allowed us to manage the yield on ads channels on a real time  hotel by hotel basis 
franchise  central services and development revenue for the year ended december  decreased by thousand  or  to million compared to million in net changes in franchise fee income accounted for about thousand of this change 
the variance was caused by a departure of franchises that left our hotel system in early  offset by the addition of three franchises to our system during the year 
however  the decreases in fees during were offset by the recording of termination fees totaling thousand 
we do not believe any of these changes in our system represent a material trend in our business 
entertainment segment revenue increased thousand for the year ended december  to million from million in this increase was due primarily to increased ticket demand for our broadway productions and for tickets in eastern washington and colorado  especially during the winter ski season in january  february and december of real estate revenue from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased by thousand  or  to million 
the decrease was due primarily to reduced rental revenue in connection with the sale of an office building that closed in march  offset by rental income from new tenants at owned real estate properties and by commissions received on the sales and leasing of certain real estate space on behalf of third parties 
direct expenses in total  direct expenses for the year ended december  decreased thousand to million in from million in direct hotels and restaurants segment expenses from continuing operations decreased from million in to million in the improvement was principally due to savings on labor resulting from adjustments of our workforce 
these savings were partially offset by increases in the costs of our self funded employee medical coverage 
we also saw the realization from cost cutting measures early in the year 
facility and land lease expense is up thousand due to the partial year lease expense associated with the sale leaseback of the river inn property discussed elsewhere 
in the other operating segments  direct costs increased in aggregate thousand  from million in to million in direct costs for franchise  central services and development were down thousand due to labor savings and cost containment 
entertainment segment direct costs were up thousand in connection with increases in sales activity requiring more labor at events 
real estate segment and corporate services direct expenses have remained consistent between periods 

table of contents depreciation and amortization was up million in compared to a portion of the million recapture of depreciation on assets held for sale described below related to properties that are part of continuing operations 
in addition we experienced additional depreciation on property and equipment additions during the year and additional amortization associated with deferred finance fees associated with the refinance during for the net loss on asset disposals was thousand 
the amount is comprised of a thousand loss on the disposition of our interest in a hotel and the disposition of signage related to the rebranding of of our hotels  offset by the recognition of deferred gains related to an office building and a hotel property 
the large gain in is related to the original sale of the same office building 
conversion costs represent the expense incurred unrelated to property and equipment to re brand the hotels to the red lion name 
undistributed corporate expenses undistributed corporate expenses for the year ended december  increased thousand to million from million for this change was due primarily to higher employee benefit costs and increases in the expenses relative to both insurance and professional services in  offset by our cost containment efforts 
undistributed corporate expense includes general and administrative charges such as corporate payroll  legal expense  contributions  directors and officers insurance  bank service charges  outside accountants and consultants expense  and investor relations charges 
we consider these expenses to be undistributed because the costs are not directly related to our business segments and therefore are not distributed to those segments 
in contrast  costs more directly related to our business segments such as accounting  human resources and information technology expenses are distributed out and included in direct expenses 
operating income operating income from continuing operations for year ended december  decreased million or from million in to million in we believe the decline in operating income was primarily due to a continued soft market and weak us economy  which continue to result in reduced room rates and occupancy at our hotels 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  up thousand over or 
the increase was due to a greater average amount of outstanding interest bearing debt in versus while the average interest rate on debt stayed consistent  in versus in other income expense other income expense for the year ended december  was a net expense of thousand  comprised of thousand in deferred loan fee write offs related to the refinance of debt during the second and fourth quarters of  partially offset by a contract termination fee of thousand and other miscellaneous net gains of thousand 
the amount is consistent with our historical results 
income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december  decreased by million to an expense of thousand compared to million of expense in primarily due to lower pre tax income and the benefit realized from certain tax credits utilized in net income loss from continuing operations net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased million compared to  due primarily to a million decline between periods in operating income for hotels and restaurants 
a number of repositioning initiatives impacted year on year financial comparisons  including the 
table of contents following results from the first quarter of included a million pre tax gain on the sale of an office building  results included more than thousand of conversion expenses including a non cash write down of signage related to the re branding of hotels to the red lion name  we completed the refinance and replacement of our revolving credit facility in the second and fourth quarter of  resulting in a non cash write off of thousand in loan fees  in the second quarter of we realized a loss on disposition of a partnership interest of thousand  and  during we recaptured depreciation expense associated with certain assets that were reclassified in as no longer held for sale 
discontinued operations in connection with our november announcement of plans to invest million to improve comfort  freshen d cor and upgrade technology at our hotels  we implemented a plan to divest of our non strategic owned hotels  one of our real estate office buildings and certain other non core properties collectively referred to as the divestment properties 
the activities of those hotels and the real estate property are considered discontinued operations under generally accepted accounting principles and were reclassified as assets held for sale  specifically designated as discontinued operations 
all of the results of operations of these hotels and office building have been reclassified from continued operations to discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
for comparative purposes  for periods prior to the balance sheet and operations activity for the properties considered discontinued has been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
the net impact on consolidated earnings of the activities of the discontinued operations was a thousand loss for the year ended december   including tax impact 
this includes aggregate activity of the hotels of a thousand net loss and a thousand net income from the office building 
this compares to the year ended december  for which the discontinued operations had a net impact on consolidated earnings of a thousand net income including tax impact 
the balance includes thousand of net income from the hotels thousand of net income from the office building 
earnings loss per share earnings per share for year ended december  decreased by to a loss per share of basic and diluted compared to earnings per share for or diluted earnings per share 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding did not change substantively during  however  income loss applicable to common shareholders decreased million 
liquidity and capital resources overview we have taken several actions that we believe strengthen our balance sheet  particularly in the long term 
those actions include the closing of the million offering of trust preferred securities in the first quarter of described below  the million debt refinance in june described elsewhere in this annual report  and the elimination of our preferred stock and its associated dividend requirements 
in addition  the credit agreement we secured in october  also described elsewhere in this annual report  provided revolving credit of up to million 
we intend to use our credit facility  if necessary  for our short term working capital needs and to  among other things  finance capital expenditures and potential acquisitions of hotels 
at december  we had no amounts outstanding under our line of credit 
on february   subsequent to the balance sheet date  we modified our existing bank credit facility with wells fargo bank by entering into a first amended and restated credit agreement 
the credit agreement includes a revolving credit facility with a total of million in borrowing capacity for working capital purposes 
additionally  we intend to use the borrowings to accelerate the pace of our capital improvements to our red lion hotels 
in january we closed on the purchase of the red lion hotel yakima gateway property pursuant to an option exercised in in april we closed on the purchase of the red lion bellevue inn property 
table of contents pursuant to an option exercised in through october we maintained a interest in a real estate limited partnership which owned the budget inn hotel 
in november  we acquired the remaining ownership from the partner 
we have not identified any other acquisitions that are probable 
our short term liquidity needs include funds for interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and on the debentures  funds for capital expenditures and  potentially  acquisitions 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and reserves established from existing cash  and  if necessary  by drawing upon our credit facility 
a majority of our leased and owned hotels are subject to leases and debt agreements that require us to spend to of room revenues derived from these hotels on replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment at these hotels  or payment of insurance premiums or real and personal property taxes with respect to these hotels 
this is consistent with what we would spend on furniture  fixtures and equipment under normal circumstances to maintain the competitive appearance of our owned and leased hotels 
in general  we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property development  property acquisitions  renovations and other non recurring capital improvements through net cash from operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  including our credit facility  the issuance of debt or equity securities and joint ventures 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report  we are also divesting non core hotel properties  one office building and other non core assets to fund a significant portion of our million reinvestment plan in the hotels 
historically  our cash and capital requirements have been satisfied through cash generated from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities  and the issuance of equity securities 
we believe cash flow from operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and existing cash on hand will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service and other obligations through our ability to fund operations  make planned capital expenditures  make required payments on any securities we may issue in the future and remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will be dependent on our future operating performance 
our future operating performance is dependent on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including occupancy and the room rates we can charge 
these factors also include prevailing economic conditions and financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors affecting our business and operations  and may be dependent on the availability of borrowings under our credit facility or other borrowings or securities offerings 
cash flow from operations  which includes the cash flows of business units identified as discontinued operations  for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  net income  after reconciling adjustments to net cash provided by operations such as non cash income statement impacts like impairment loss  depreciation  loan fee write offs  the deferred tax provision  gains and losses on assets  and the provision for doubtful accounts totaled million in for net income adjusted for those same items totaled million 
the difference was predominantly due to lower net operating performance  specifically in the franchise segment and associated with increases in undistributed corporate expenses 
working capital changes  including restricted cash  receivables  accruals  payables  and inventories  used an additional million in cash during this was predominantly due to a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in other current assets 
in  restricted cash and the timing of payroll liabilities accounted for million of the change in cash 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash additions to property and equipment totaled million in compared to million in the capital additions includes million of cash paid related to the three property acquisitions during that period  in addition to million of capital improvement projects 
the three acquisitions consisted of million related to the acquisition of the yakima gateway property  million related to the acquisition of the bellevue property  and approximately thousand related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in the budget inn 
also in  we had cash proceeds on assets sold of million  including approximately million related to the sale of certain land in spokane  washington 

table of contents the capital additions included an investment in signage related to the red lion rebranding initiative and various other projects in the operating divisions 
it also included additions to certain software and equipment which was sold and then leased back as described in the annual report 
proceeds from asset dispositions include thousand received in connection with the disposition of our ownership interest in a hotel property in the second quarter of and million related to the sales operating leaseback of another property during the fourth quarter of described in our annual report 
the other major variances between the two periods were the million investment in the trust described above  representing of the total capitalization of the trust and the million advance to the trust to cover the trust preferred offering costs 
lastly  during the second quarter of we received a thousand distribution and a million payment under a note receivable from an equity method investee that owns the whc building 
net financing activities provided million during the year ended december  including million in proceeds from the debenture sale  offset by million paid to redeem the series a and series b preferred shares 
we also paid million in dividends during the first quarter of  had scheduled principal payments on long term debt of million and no net activity under the credit facility note payable to bank 
this compares to a net usage of cash for financing activities including a net million repaid on the then existing credit facility note payable to bank  million borrowed under term loans  million borrowed as interim financing related to equipment leases  million paid in scheduled principal payments on long term debt and capital leases  million paid in deferred financing costs  and million paid in preferred stock dividends 
at december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents for continuing operations  including million of cash restricted under securitized borrowing arrangements for future payment of furniture  fixtures and equipment  repairs  insurance premiums and real and personal property taxes 
at december   million of the cash balance was held in short term  liquid investments readily available for our use 
at december  we had million in cash on hand including restricted cash of million 
approximately million of the cash balance was held by an intermediary related to the sale of the red lion river inn  without restriction as to use  to facilitate a tax deferred exchange transaction completed in cash and cash equivalents included with assets of discontinued operations were thousand and thousand as of december  and  respectively 
financing during the first quarter of we completed a public offering of million of trust preferred securities through westcoast hospitality capital trust the trust  a delaware statutory trust sponsored by us 
the securities  which have been listed on the new york stock exchange  entitle holders to cumulative cash distributions at a annual rate and mature on february  in addition  we invested million in trust common securities  representing of the total capitalization of the trust 
the trust used the proceeds of the offering and our investment to purchase from us million of our junior subordinated debentures with payment terms that mirror the distribution terms of the trust securities 
interest incurred on the debentures is tax deductible by us under current us federal tax law and the debentures are uncollateralized 
the cost of the trust preferred offering totaled million  including million of underwriting commissions and expenses and thousand of costs incurred directly by the trust 
the trust paid these costs utilizing an advance from us 
the advance to the trust is included with other long term assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the proceeds received by us from the debenture sale  net of the costs of the trust preferred offering and our investment in the trust  were million 
we utilized approximately million of these net offering proceeds to pay accrued dividends on and redeem in full all outstanding shares of our series a and series b preferred stock on february  dividend payments on these preferred shares were not tax deductible 
we are using the million balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including capital improvements 

table of contents our revolving credit agreement in effect at december  with wells fargo bank national association secured during october provided a revolving credit facility with a total of million in borrowing capacity 
this included two revolving lines of credit line a allowed for maximum borrowings of million and was collateralized by our personal property and five of our owned hotels 
line b allowed for maximum borrowings of million and was collateralized by our personal property 
line b expired in october and was not renewed  leaving the maximum borrowing capacity under the credit agreement at million 
interest under the line is computed based  at our option  upon either the bank s prime rate or certain libor rates 
the agreement  as amended and effective december   contained certain restrictions and covenants  the most restrictive of which required us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million  a minimum ebitda coverage ratio of  and a maximum funded debt to ebitda as defined by the bank ratio of for the four quarters ended december  at december  we were in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement 
we utilized line a during the first quarter of  with the maximum amount borrowed during that quarter of million 
this borrowing was made prior to the close of our trust preferred offering in february the line was not used during the second  third or fourth quarters of at december  no amounts were outstanding under any portion of the credit agreement 
on february   subsequent to the balance sheet date  we modified our existing bank credit facility with wells fargo by entering into a first amended and restated credit agreement

critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the accounting principles of our company comply with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the more critical accounting policies and estimates used relate to revenue is generally recognized as services are performed

 depreciation would be recaptured for the period they were classified on the balance sheet as held for sale 
our company s intangible assets include brands and goodwill 
we account for our brands and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 

we expect to receive future benefits from previously acquired brands and goodwill over an indefinite period of time and therefore do not amortize our brands and goodwill in accordance with sfas no

this statement also amends sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  to state that the guidance for a incidental operations and b costs incurred to sell real estate projects does not apply to real estate time sharing transactions 
the accounting for those operations and costs is subject to the guidance in sop this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 

the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

this statement is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render service 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on july   requiring compensation cost to be recognized as expense for the portion of outstanding unvested awards  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated using an option pricing model 
we are evaluating the impact  if any  that these provisions of sfas no 
r may have on our consolidated financial statements but do not expect them to have a material impact 
in addition  fas no 
r will require the company to recognize compensation expense  if applicable  for the difference between the fair value of our common stock at the actual purchase price of that stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we cannot estimate what the final impact to the consolidated statement of operations will be in the future  because it will depend on  among other things  when and if shares are purchased and certain variables known only when the plan is purchasing shares
