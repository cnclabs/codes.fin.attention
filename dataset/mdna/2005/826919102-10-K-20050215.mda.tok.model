item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see the cautionary statement above and factors affecting our future operating results under item for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our fiscal year end financial reporting periods are a or week year ending on the saturday closest to december st 
fiscal had weeks and ended on january  fiscal had weeks with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter of the year and ended on january  fiscal had weeks and ended on december  overview we design and develop proprietary  analog intensive  mixed signal integrated circuits ics for a broad range of applications 
our innovative ics can dramatically reduce the cost  size and system power requirements of the products that our customers sell to consumers 
we currently offer ics that can be incorporated into communications devices  such as wireless phones and modems  as well as cable and satellite set top boxes  residential communication gateways for cable or digital subscriber line dsl  satellite radios and networking equipment 
we also offer a family of bit microcontrollers mcus for use in a broad array of applications such as industrial automation and control  automotive sensors and controls  medical instrumentation  and electronic test and measurement equipment 
our major customers include agere systems  conexant  hughes network systems  intel  lg electronics  sagem  samsung  sendo  smart link and thomson 
our company was founded in our business has grown rapidly since our inception  as reflected by our employee headcount  which increased to at the end of fiscal  from employees at the end of fiscal and employees at the end of fiscal as a fabless semiconductor company  we rely on third party semiconductor fabricators in asia  and to a lesser extent the united states  to manufacture the silicon wafers that reflect our ic designs 
each wafer contains numerous die  which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an ic 
we also rely on third parties in asia to assemble  package  and  in the substantial majority of cases  test these die and ship these units to our customers 
we have increased the amount of testing performed by such third parties  which facilitates faster delivery of products to our customers particularly those located in asia  shorter production cycle times  lower inventory requirements  lower costs and increased flexibility of test capacity 
we implemented supply chain management software during fiscal which improved our ability to scale our operations  reduced our inventory requirements and improved the quality of our shipment scheduling commitments with our customers through improved efficiency 
our product set has expanded to a broad portfolio targeting mobile handset and broad based mixed signal applications 
our expertise in analog intensive  high performance  mixed signal ics enables us to develop highly differentiated solutions that address multiple markets 
for example  our silicon direct access arrangement daa product family is optimized for the personal computer pc modem market  our isomodem family of embedded modems has been widely adopted by satellite set top box manufacturers  and our aero global system for mobile communications gsm general packet radio services gprs transceiver family is being shipped in mobile handsets worldwide 
we continue to introduce next generation ics with added functionality and further integration 
in february  we introduced a power amplifier product for gsm gprs mobile handsets that is in the sampling stage to wireless customers 
in june  we introduced the aero ii transceiver that provides increased performance and integration over our prior offerings 
in july  we introduced and are now sampling the aero edge radio  which addresses the enhanced data rates for global evolution edge standard for mobile handsets 
through our recently acquired mcu business and our internal development efforts  we further diversified our product portfolio 
we plan to continue to diversify our product portfolio by introducing products that increase the content we provide for existing applications and by introducing ics for markets we do not currently address  thereby expanding our total available market opportunity 
we group our products into two categories  mobile handset products and broad based mixed signal products 
mobile handset products include the aero transceivers  to the extent incorporated into handsets  the rf synthesizers and the power amplifier 
broad based mixed signal products include our silicon daa  isomodem  proslic  satellite tuner  dsl analog front end  clock chips  optical transceivers and clock data recovery ics cdrs  general purpose rf synthesizers for non handset applications  as well as the microcontroller products 
during fiscal  and  one customer  samsung  represented  and of our revenues  respectively 
no other single end customer accounted for more than of our revenues in any of these years 
in addition to direct sales to customers  some of our end customers purchase products indirectly from us through distributors and contract manufacturers 
an end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer 
although we actually sell the products to  and are paid by  the distributors and contract manufacturers  we refer to such end customer as our customer 
two of our distributors  edom technology and uniquest  each selling products to customers in asia  represented and of our fiscal revenues  respectively 
there was one distributor  edom technology  which accounted for of our total revenues during fiscal two of our distributors  uniquest and edom technology  represented and of our fiscal revenues  respectively 
there were no other distributors or contract manufacturers that accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal years  or the percentage of our revenues derived from customers located outside of the united states was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal this percentage increase in the two most recent years reflects our product and customer diversification and increased market penetration for our products  as many of our mobile handset  and increasingly  broad based mixed signal customers manufacture and design their products in asia 
all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
we believe that a majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from customers outside of the united states 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our ics can range from one month to months or more 
an additional three to six months or more are usually required before a customer ships a significant volume of devices that incorporate our ics 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we typically experience a significant delay between incurring expenses for research and development and selling  general and administrative efforts  and the generation of corresponding sales 
consequently  if sales in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and  potentially  future quarters would be adversely affected 
moreover  the amount of time between initial research and development and commercialization of a product  if ever  can be substantially longer than the sales cycle for the product 
accordingly  if we incur substantial research and development costs without developing a commercially successful product  our operating results  as well as our growth prospects  could be adversely affected 
because many of our ics are designed for use in consumer products such as personal computers pcs  personal video recorders  set top boxes and mobile handsets  we expect that the demand for our products will be typically subject to some degree of seasonal demand resulting in increased sales in the third and fourth quarters of each year when customers place orders to meet holiday demand 
however  rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas make it difficult for us to accurately estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
the following describes the line items set forth in our consolidated statements of income revenues 
revenues are generated almost exclusively by sales of our ics 
we recognize revenue on sales when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales direct to customers and contract manufacturers upon shipment 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on products unsold by distributors 
accordingly  we defer the revenue and cost of revenue on such sales until the distributors sell the product to the end customer 
our products typically carry a one year replacement warranty 
replacements have been insignificant to date 
our revenues are subject to variation from period to period due to the volume of shipments made within a period and the prices we charge for our products 
the vast majority of our revenues were negotiated at prices that reflect a discount from the list prices for our products 
these discounts are made for a variety of reasons  including to establish a relationship with a new customer  as an incentive for customers to purchase products in larger volumes  and to provide profit margin to our distributors who resell our products or in response to competition 
in addition  as a product matures  we expect that the average selling price for such product will decline due to the greater availability of competing products 
our ability to increase revenues in the future is dependent on increased demand for our established products and our ability to ship larger volumes of those products in response to such demand  as well as our ability to develop or acquire new products and subsequently achieve customer acceptance of newly introduced products 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of those products  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance  costs of software royalties and amortization of purchased software  other intellectual property license costs  and certain acquired intangible assets  an allocated portion of our occupancy costs  allocable depreciation of testing equipment and leasehold improvements  impairment charges related to certain manufacturing equipment held for sale or abandoned  and  for prior periods  a portion of the settlement costs associated with a patent infringement lawsuit 
generally  we depreciate equipment over four years on a straight line basis and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the applicable lease term 
recently introduced products tend to have higher cost of revenues per unit due to initially low production volumes required by our customers and higher costs associated with new package variations 
generally  as production volumes for a product increase  unit production costs tend to decrease as our yields improve and our semiconductor fabricators  assemblers and test operations achieve greater economies of scale for that product 
additionally  the cost of wafer procurement and assembly and test services  which are significant components of cost of goods sold  vary cyclically with overall demand for semiconductors and our suppliers available capacity of such products and services 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs of employees engaged in research and development activities  new product mask  wafer  packaging and test costs  external consulting and services costs  amortization of purchased software  equipment tooling  equipment depreciation  amortization of acquired intangible assets  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs for such operations 
we generally depreciate our research and development equipment over four years and amortize our purchased software from computer aided design tool vendors over three to four years 
research and development activities include the design of new products  refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  related allocable portion of our occupancy costs  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  professional fees  directors and officers liability insurance  patent litigation legal fees  other promotional and marketing expenses  and reserves for bad debt 
write offs of uncollectible accounts have been insignificant to date 
write off of in process research development 
write off of in process research development reflects the write off of in process research and development costs which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of cygnal in fiscal and krypton isolation  inc krypton in fiscal impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets reflects the charge to write down that portion of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets that was in excess of its fair market value 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options and direct issuances of stock to our employees  we record deferred stock compensation  representing  for accounting purposes  the difference between the exercise price of option grants  or the issuance price of direct issuances of stock  as the case may be  and the fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants or issuances 
the deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options or shares  generally five to eight years 
the amortization of deferred stock compensation is recorded as an operating expense 
interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
we generally invest in tax exempt short term investments which yield lower nominal interest proceeds 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest on our short and long term obligations 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net primarily reflects our share of income and losses related to our equity investments and the gain on the disposal of fixed assets 
provision for income taxes 
we accrue a provision for federal  state and foreign income tax at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses  research and development tax credits and interest income from tax exempt short term investments

mobile handsets mobile handset revenues were million or of total revenues in fiscal compared to the prior year  revenues increased million or 
growth in the sales of our mobile handset products were driven by increased unit sales of our aero transceiver family of products reflecting the increased demand and market share gains driven largely by asian mobile handset customers 
unit sales of our mobile handset products increased year over year by 
in addition  average selling prices in this area increased year over year by 
broad based mixed signal broad based mixed signal revenues were million or of total revenues in fiscal compared to the prior year  revenues increased million or 
growth in the sales of our broad based mixed signal products were primarily driven by increased unit sales of our isomodems reflecting growth in demand and market share gains primarily in the set top box and personal video recorder market segments  microcontrollers  a new business that we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal which contributed revenues of million in fiscal  proslics reflecting growth in demand and market share gains in the voice over internet protocol voip market segment  and daas reflecting growth in demand in voice applications  such as voip  and modems for personal computers 
unit sales of broad based mixed signal products increased year over year by 
in addition  average selling prices in this area increased year over year by reflecting the change in mix in this area towards higher priced items 
as our products become more mature  we expect to experience decreases in average selling prices in the future 
our revenues will be dependent on our ability to increase sales volumes and introduce higher priced  next generation products and product extensions 
gross profit year ended in millions january  january  change change gross profit percent of revenue the year over year increase in gross profit dollars for fiscal was primarily due to the substantial increase in sales volumes in both our mobile handset and broad based mixed signal product groups 
the increase in gross profit percentage in fiscal was primarily due to the absence of any significant one time charges such as the million charge associated with a patent litigation settlement recorded during the first fiscal quarter of we expect to experience declines in the average selling prices of our mobile handset products and certain of our broad based mixed signal products 
this downward pressure on gross profit as a percentage of revenues may be offset to the extent we are able to introduce higher margin new products and continue to gain market share with our broad based mixed signal ics  and achieve lower production costs from our wafer foundries and third party assembly and test sub contractors 
research and development year ended in millions january  january  change change research and development percent of revenue the year over year increase in research and development expense for fiscal was principally due to increased staffing  including personnel related to our acquisition of cygnal  and associated occupancy and other costs to pursue new product development opportunities  and to continue to develop new testing methodologies for newly introduced and existing products 
some of our more significant development projects in the mobile handset product area included a power amplifier  a single chip transceiver  and an edge compliant radio 
significant development projects in the broad based mixed signal product area included the f and f microcontrollers integrating analog to digital converters targeting precision measurement applications 
all of these development projects have either been completed or are scheduled to be completed over the next twelve months 
additionally  many of these new products are being sampled by certain of our customers and are in the design in phase 
we don t expect the products derived from these projects to begin to contribute to revenues in a meaningful way until fiscal years or additionally  we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and associated costs to pursue additional new product development opportunities  and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to changes in sales volume and the timing of certain expensive items related to new product development initiatives  such as engineering mask and wafer costs 
selling  general and administrative year ended in millions january  january  change change selling  general and administrative percent of revenue the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense was principally attributable to an increase of approximately million for sales commissions and bonuses associated with our increased revenue levels  an increase of approximately million for personnel associated with our acquisition of cygnal  an increase of approximately million for increased staffing and associated costs related to the expansion of our internal information technology and services support organization  an increase of approximately million for increased staffing and associated costs associated with the geographical expansion of our sales support organization in asia and europe  an increase of approximately million in legal  consulting and auditing fees which were primarily driven by activities related to the establishment of a headquarters for non us operations in singapore and compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  and an increase of approximately million for increased staffing and associated costs related to product marketing and marketing applications activities associated with our mobile handset products 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to expand our sales channels  marketing efforts and administrative infrastructure 
in addition  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues because of potential significant variability in our future revenues  fluctuating usage of advertising to promote our products and  in particular  our newly introduced products  and fluctuating legal costs related to litigation and intellectual property matters 
write off of in process research development year ended in millions january  january  change write off of in process research development we wrote off in process research and development in fiscal related to our acquisition of cygnal 
we did not have any such write offs in fiscal amortization of deferred stock compensation year ended in millions january  january  change amortization of deferred stock compensation the decrease in the dollar amounts of amortization of deferred stock compensation is primarily related to the expiration of amortization on certain grants in which the deferred stock compensation has become fully amortized because the grants have become fully vested 
interest income year ended in millions january  january  change interest income the increase in the dollar amount of interest income was due to a greater amount of cash and short term investments balances during the year ended january  and due to an increase in the interest rates of the underlying instruments during fiscal interest expense year ended in millions january  january  change interest expense the increase in the dollar amount of interest expense during the most recent period was due to accrued interest associated with software license agreements 
other income expense  net year ended in millions january  january  change other income expense  net the increase in the dollar amount of other income for the most recent period was primarily due to gains on the sale of test equipment 
provision for income taxes year ended in millions january  january  change provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of due to the impact of research and development tax credits  state taxes  tax advantaged interest income and other permanent items 
we anticipate the effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately due to our recent completion of an alignment of our financial structure with our international operational structure 
however  due to the variability of business conditions  the relative mix in earnings between the us and international operations  and other risks  this effective tax rate may not be realized 
our us earnings are typically taxed at a higher rate than our international earnings 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues year ended in millions january  december  change change revenues the increase in revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to significant growth in the volume of sales for our aero transceiver used in gsm mobile handsets and isomodem products used in satellite set top boxes  primarily reflecting gains in market share and an increase in the overall market size 
we saw significant growth in the sales of our daa products  primarily reflecting an increase in the overall market demand for these products and strength in mobile notebook computer modems 
during fiscal  we experienced normal decreases in the average selling prices for certain products 
however  these price decreases were offset by the significant increases in sales volumes for our products and the introduction of higher priced next generation products and product extensions 
gross profit year ended in millions january  december  change change gross profit percent of revenue the increase in gross profit dollars from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the substantial increase in sales volume 
the decrease in gross margin percentage from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to a million charge associated with a patent litigation settlement in fiscal  a greater portion of our sales being comprised of our lower margin mobile handset products  and a million impairment charge associated with test equipment held for sale 
research and development year ended in millions january  december  change change research and development percent of revenue the increase in the dollar amount of research and development expense from fiscal to fiscal was principally due to increased staffing and associated costs to pursue new product development opportunities  and continue to develop new testing methodologies for newly introduced and existing products 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense decreased due to the substantial increase in revenues in fiscal selling  general and administrative year ended in millions january  december  change change selling  general and administrative percent of revenue the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense from fiscal to fiscal was principally attributable to increased staffing and associated costs  sales commissions associated with our higher revenues and the conversion of our largest customer account  samsung  from a non commission bearing distributor account to a commission bearing direct account  and employee bonuses resulting from increased earnings 
this increase was partially offset by lower patent litigation related legal costs following settlement of the tdk litigation 
write off of in process research development year ended in millions january  december  change write off of in process research development we wrote off in process research and development in fiscal related to our acquisition of cygnal 
we did not have any write offs in fiscal impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during fiscal during fiscal  we wrote off thousand  which represented the remaining goodwill related to the fiscal acquisition of krypton 
amortization of deferred stock compensation year ended in millions january  december  change amortization of deferred stock compensation the decrease in the dollar amounts of amortization of deferred stock compensation in fiscal was primarily related to the expiration of amortization on certain grants in which the deferred stock compensation has become fully amortized because the grants have become fully vested 
interest income year ended in millions january  december  change interest income the decrease in the dollar amount of interest income in fiscal was generally due to lower interest rates on cash and short term investments balances during the current year and our transition to tax exempt investments which bear even lower interest rates 
interest expense year ended in millions january  december  change interest expense the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower debt  lease and other long term payable balances during fiscal other income expense  net year ended in millions january  december  change other income expense  net other expense primarily reflects our share of the losses in our investment in asic design services  inc provision for income taxes year ended in millions january  december  change provision for income taxes effective tax rate provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of due to the impact of research and development tax credits  state taxes  tax advantaged interest income and other permanent items 
business outlook we expect revenues in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
furthermore  we expect our diluted net income per share to be in the range of to 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity as of january  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our short term investments consist primarily of municipal and corporate debt securities that have initial maturities of less than one year 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal the increase was principally due the higher sales volumes and net income during fiscal and the absence of any significant one time payments in fiscal such as the million payment associated with a patent litigation settlement made during fiscal operating cash flows during fiscal reflect our net income of million  adjustments for non cash items depreciation  amortization  gain on disposal of property  equipment and software and tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options of million  and a net increase in the components of our working capital of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash used of million during fiscal the increase was principally due to an increase of million in net purchases of short term investments  a million decrease in the net cash acquired from acquisition of business activity and a million increase in net purchases of property  equipment and software and other assets 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal additionally  as part of our growth strategy  we expect to evaluate opportunities to invest in or acquire other businesses  intellectual property or technologies that would complement or expand our current offerings  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal the decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal was principally due to lower proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
in our day to day business activities  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as purchase orders  leases and other long term contracts 
maturities under these contracts are set forth in the following table as of january   in thousands payments due by period thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations operating lease obligations include amounts for leased facilities 
purchase obligations include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders with suppliers where there is a fixed non cancelable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of research and development projects  potential acquisitions of companies or technologies and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
we believe our existing cash and short term investment balances are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues and cost of revenues on sales to distributors  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past their contractual due date  the current business environment  and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future 
accounts receivable write offs to date have been minimal 
inventory valuation we assess the recoverability of inventories through an on going review of inventory levels in relation to sales history  backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
to address the difficult  subjective and complex area of judgment in determining appropriate inventory valuation in a consistent manner  we apply a set of methods  assumptions and estimates to arrive at the net inventory amount by completing the following first  we identify any inventory that has been previously written down in prior periods 
this inventory remains written down until sold  destroyed or otherwise disposed of 
second  we write down the inventory line items that may have some form of obsolescence due to non conformance with electrical and mechanical standards as identified by our quality assurance personnel 
third  the remaining inventory not otherwise identified to be written down is compared to an assessment of product history and forecasted demand  typically over the last six months and next six months  or actual firm backlog on hand 
however  microcontroller product history and forecasted demand is typically measured over the last twelve months and next twelve months  respectively  due to the breadth of customers and markets served and longer product life cycles 
finally  the result of this methodology is compared against the product life cycle and competitive situations in the marketplace driving the outlook for the consumption of the inventory and the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those that we project 
in the event that actual demand is lower or market conditions are worse than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including fixed assets and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
occasionally  we may hold certain assets for sale 
in those cases  the assets are reclassified on our balance sheet from long term to current  and the carrying value of such assets are reviewed and adjusted each period thereafter to the fair value less expected cost to sell 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  the accounting guidance allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the second step of the analysis compares the implied fair value of our goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income loss for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
further  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in additional assessments of income tax 
we believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment  sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options 
under the new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the consolidated statement of income 
sfas r will be effective for periods beginning after june  and allows  but does not require  companies to restate the full fiscal year of to reflect the impact of expensing share based payments under sfas r 
we have not yet determined which fair value method and transitional provision we will follow 
however  we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas r will impact our overall financial position 
see stock based compensation in note for the pro forma impact on net income and net income per share from calculating stock based compensation costs under the fair value alternative of sfas however  the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective date of sfas r may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under sfas  but such differences have not yet been quantified 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital and the maximization of after tax returns on our investment portfolio 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments holdings as of january   an immediate one percentage point decline in the yield for such instruments would decrease our annual interest income by approximately million 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in terms of the average maturity of our investments and the credit quality of the investments we hold
