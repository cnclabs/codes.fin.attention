future events and actual results  performance  and achievements could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking statements 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect actual results or changes in  or additions to  the factors affecting such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause our actual results of operations or financial condition to differ from those described in this report include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following o our business is dependent upon our being able to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends  customer preferences  and other fashion related factors  which we may not be able to successfully accomplish in the future 
o a slowdown in the united states economy  an uncertain economic outlook  and escalating energy costs could lead to reduced consumer demand for our apparel and accessories in the future 
o our business could be negatively affected by a deflationary pricing environment in the apparel industry 
o the women s specialty retail apparel industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
o we cannot assure the successful implementation of our business plan for increased profitability and growth in our plus size women s apparel business 
o our business plan is largely dependent upon continued growth in the plus size women s apparel market  which may not occur 
o we depend on key personnel  particularly our chief executive officer  dorrit j 
bern  and we may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel

o we depend on the availability of credit for our working capital needs  including credit we receive from our suppliers and their agents  and on our credit card securitization facility 
if we were unable to obtain sufficient financing at an affordable cost  our ability to merchandise our stores would be adversely affected

such risks include but are not necessarily limited to political instability  imposition of  or changes in  duties or quotas  trade restrictions  increased security requirements applicable to imports  delays in shipping  increased costs of transportation  and issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards 
o our stores experience seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income

in addition  extreme or unseasonable weather conditions may have a negative impact on our sales 
o natural disasters  as well as war  acts of terrorism  or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and customer traffic to our stores  or otherwise adversely affect our business 
o we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance for our operations at a reasonable cost 
o we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights  which are important to our success and our competitive position 
o we may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of suitable sales associates at our stores 
o our manufacturers may be unable to manufacture and deliver merchandise to us in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards 
o our sales are dependent upon a high volume of traffic in the strip centers and malls in which our stores are located  and our future growth is dependent upon the availability of suitable locations for new stores 
o we may be unable to successfully implement our plan to improve merchandise assortments in our brands 
o the carrying amount and or useful life of intangible assets related to acquisitions are subject to periodic valuation tests 
an adverse change in interest rates or other factors could have a significant impact on the results of the valuation tests  resulting in a write down of the carrying value or acceleration of amortization of acquired intangible assets 
o pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to include our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports 
our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to attest to whether or not our assessment is fairly stated in all material respects and to separately report on whether or not they believe that we maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting 
if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to timely attest to our assessment  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a possible loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting 
such a failure could result in our inability to provide timely and or reliable financial information and could adversely affect our business 
restatement of financial statements our system of internal controls over financial reporting includes the monitoring of emerging accounting issues and the reviewing of industry and peer group filings and news releases 
as a result of the publicity on the restaurant industry financial statement restatements related to leases  we commenced a review of certain of our accounting policies related to leases during january subsequently  on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease related accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
based on our internal review  and after consultation with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm  we restated our financial statements for years prior to fiscal to correct our accounting for landlord allowances  calculation of straight line rent expense  recognition of rent holiday periods  and depreciation of leasehold improvements for our retail stores 
we lease substantially all of our stores under non cancelable operating lease agreements 
these lease agreements generally include standard language on landlord allowances for costs relating to the design  construction  fixturing  and opening of stores 
construction allowances vary by store  and represent a reimbursement from the landlord for a portion of the leasehold improvement costs we incur 
historically  we classified construction allowances as a reduction of property  equipment  and leasehold improvements on our consolidated balance sheets and as a reduction of capital expenditures on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in addition  when accounting for leases with renewal options  we historically recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial non cancelable lease term  beginning with the lease commencement date 
however  we depreciated leasehold improvements over their estimated useful life of ten years  which  in many cases  may have included both the initial non cancelable lease term and option renewal periods provided for in the lease 
also  we historically recognized rent holiday periods on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing with the initial occupancy date  or the opening date of the stores 
management re evaluated fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  and determined that the lease term should commence on the date we take possession of the leased space for construction purposes  which is generally two months prior to a store opening date 
as a result of the restatement  construction allowances have been recorded as a deferred rent liability on our consolidated balance sheets instead of being recorded as a reduction of the cost of leasehold improvements 
in our consolidated statements of cash flows  we have recognized construction allowances as an operating activity instead of recognizing them as a reduction of our investment in capital assets 
in addition  the construction allowances will be amortized over the related lease term as a reduction of rent expense rather than as a reduction of depreciation expense commencing on the date we take possession of the leased space for construction purposes 
we also corrected the lease term used to determine straight line rent expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements to include lease option renewal periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period is reasonably assured and the failure to exercise such an option would result in an economic penalty 
depreciation of leasehold improvements has been recognized over the shorter of the corrected lease term or the assets estimated useful lives 
lease terms used to determine straight line rent expense include pre opening store build out periods commonly referred to as rent holidays  where applicable 
these corrections resulted in the accelerated recognition of certain annual rent expense and depreciation expense on leasehold improvements 
as a result of the above corrections  we recorded additional deferred rent in accrued expenses and deferred taxes and other non current liabilities and we adjusted retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet 
we also corrected amortization in cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for each of our three fiscal years in the period ended january  these accounting changes resulted in a decrease in retained earnings of million for the cumulative effect as of the beginning of fiscal  and decreases in retained earnings of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these corrections did not have any impact on our previously reported comparable store sales  net sales  cash flow  and actual lease payments  or on the economic value of our leasehold improvements 
see item financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  note restatement of financial statements below for further details of the restatement 
overview we are a specialty apparel retailer primarily focused on serving the plus size woman through three distinct brands lane bryant  fashion bug  and catherines plus sizes 
we currently represent approximately of the women s plus size specialty retail apparel market  and we are the third largest specialty apparel retailer in the united states 
through our varied plus size fashion concepts  we cater to customers from a broad range of socioeconomic  demographic  and cultural groups 
as of january   we operated  stores in states 
the apparel industry is highly competitive and is continuously faced with new and existing competitors seeking areas of growth to expand their businesses 
our strategy focuses on increasing our market share in the growing plus size women s apparel market through our three brands 
americans continue to gain weight in all age groups  with an estimated of american adults being overweight and half of american women wearing size or larger 
through our three brands  we offer plus size women s apparel to a broad range of age groups  with varied fashion tastes and income levels  in multiple shopping venues 
by focusing on the plus size market  we believe that we are well positioned to meet the demands of this growing demographic 
our long term plans are to continue to expand our market position in the women s plus size specialty apparel market 
these plans include the addition of new stores primarily at our lane bryant brand  continued growth in e commerce  entry into the catalog business  international expansion  and increasing our relevance to our customer 
in fiscal  we more than doubled our sales volume in our e commerce channel and expanded e commerce into canada 
we view the direct to consumer channels  including catalogs  to be disproportionately important to the plus size customer and a significant growth opportunity 
in october  the lane bryant catalog trademark  which is currently licensed by a third party  will revert back to lane bryant 
we are currently building our direct to consumer business organization for entry into catalog sales 
we view the growth in our store base and the extension into other direct to consumer channels as an opportunity for us to maintain and increase our market share 
we continue to pursue ways to increase our relevance to our customer  and believe that through factors such as our expertise in plus size fit and our figure magazine america s leading plus size fashion and lifestyle magazine we are differentiating ourselves from our competitors 
with the addition of e commerce at our fashion bug website in fiscal  we now offer e commerce at each of our three brands 
our fiscal plan is to increase our e commerce sales volume more than by continuing to broaden category offerings at our websites 
our e commerce sales in fiscal and fiscal were less than one percent and two percent  respectively  of our consolidated net sales  and we expect our e commerce sales in fiscal to increase to more than two percent of consolidated net sales 
although our websites primarily offer basic merchandise assortments  we see opportunities to expand our product offerings into additional categories  such as hard to find sizes 
this will allow us to offer a greater variety of merchandise categories than those currently offered in our stores 
over the last three years  the retail apparel industry has been negatively affected by the general slowdown in the us economy  reduced levels of consumer confidence  and the unstable geopolitical climate 
we expect the deflationary pricing environment to continue to impact the apparel industry 
in addition  the elimination of quota on imports in may create further downward pressure on retail prices 
in fiscal we initiated a cost reduction plan that decreased expenses by a total of approximately million on an annualized basis 
in fiscal  we completed the cost reduction initiative with the consolidation of our catherines and lane bryant distribution centers into our new white marsh distribution center 
in addition to our continuing focus on maintaining control over expenses and inventories  another area of focus in fiscal is the continued improvement of gross margins at our three brands through improved product mix and reduced markdowns 
we made significant progress in fiscal  particularly at our lane bryant brand 
an improvement of basis points in our consolidated gross margin in fiscal contributed to a increase in our net income over the prior year 
the positive results achieved in fiscal are primarily attributable to plans implemented in fiscal to improve merchandise assortments at our lane bryant brand 
in fiscal  lane bryant experienced a increase in comparable store sales 
however  our fashion bug brand experienced only a modest increase in comparable store sales  while our catherines brand experienced a decrease in comparable store sales 
our fiscal results were negatively impacted by disappointing sales performances at each of our brands during the fourth quarter  mainly as a result of our lack of a timely response to the competitive promotional environment that developed during the christmas holiday season 
our challenge in fiscal will be to improve the performance of our fashion bug and catherines brands while continuing to enhance our lane bryant brand s performance 
another area we focused on in fiscal was inventory management 
improved management of inventory during fiscal resulted in a decrease in inventory of million  which allowed us to utilize our working capital more effectively  while concurrently increasing comparable store sales 
as a result  we strengthened our balance sheet and increased our cash flows 
critical accounting policies we have prepared the financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  analysis of current trends  and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we periodically reevaluate our accounting policies  assumptions  and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances warrant 
historically  actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  we consider the following accounting policies and related assumptions to be more critical to  and involve the most significant management judgments and estimates in  the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in the financial statements as amended by sab 
our revenues from merchandise sales are net of returns and allowances and exclude sales tax 
we record a reserve for estimated future sales returns based on an analysis of actual returns and we defer recognition of layaway sales to the date of delivery 
a change in our actual rates of sales returns and layaway sales experience would affect the level of revenue recognized 
revenues from our e commerce business include shipping and handling fees billed to customers 
e commerce revenues are recognized after the following have occurred execution of the customer s order  authorization of the customer s credit card has been received  and the product has been shipped and received by the customer 
we record a reserve for estimated future e commerce sales returns based on an analysis of actual returns 
we offer our customers various loyalty card programs 
customers that join these programs are entitled to various benefits  including discounts and rebates on purchases during the membership period 
customers generally join these programs by paying an annual membership fee 
we recognize revenue from these loyalty programs as sales over the life of the membership period based on when the customer earns the benefits and when the fee is no longer refundable 
costs we incur in connection with administering these programs are recognized in cost of goods sold as incurred 
during fiscal  we introduced a fashion bug customer loyalty card program that we operate under our fashion bug proprietary credit card program 
this program provides customers with the option to cancel their membership within days  entitling them to a full refund of their annual fee 
additionally  after days  customers that cancel their membership are entitled to a pro rata fee refund based on the number of months remaining on the annual membership 
accordingly  we recognize of the annual membership fee as revenue after days  with the remaining fee recognized on a pro rata basis over nine months 
under a previous fashion bug customer loyalty card program  we recognized revenues from annual membership fees as sales over the life of the membership based on discounts earned by the customer 
for customers who did not earn discounts during the membership period that exceeded the card fee  the difference between the membership fee and discounts earned was recognized as revenue upon the expiration of the annual membership period 
upon early cancellation of the loyalty card  refunds of membership fees were reduced by the amount of any discounts granted to the member under the program 
we discontinued the issuance of new cards under this program in december  and we terminated the program during the second quarter of fiscal inventories we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market under the retail inventory method average cost basis  which is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost  and the resulting gross margins  are adjusted in proportion to markdowns and shrinkage on our retail inventories 
the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
the rim calculation involves certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
events such as store closings  liquidations  and a weak general economic environment for retail apparel sales could result in an increase in the level of markdowns 
such an increase in the level of markdowns could result in lower inventory values and increases to cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in future periods under the rim 
also  failure to properly estimate markdowns currently can result in an overstatement or understatement of inventory cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
at the end of fiscal and fiscal  in addition to markdowns that had been recorded in inventory  an additional million and million  respectively  of markdowns  representing markdowns not yet taken on aged inventory  was recorded in order to properly reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we elected to adopt the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
see accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor below as of the beginning of fiscal as of january  and january   million and million  respectively  of cash received from vendors was deferred into inventory to be recognized as inventory is sold 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 we are required to assess our long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we consider historical performance and estimated future results in our evaluation of potential impairment  and compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we write down the asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
our estimate of fair value is generally based on either appraised value or the present value of future cash flows  based on a number of assumptions and estimates 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded a million write down of under performing assets related to our consolidated monsoon joint venture during fiscal the write down is included in occupancy expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of the beginning of fiscal in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we performed a review of our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment 
as a result  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill related to our catherines acquisition which included the value of intangible assets we did not separately account for at the date of the catherines acquisition exceeded the estimated fair value of the goodwill under sfas no 
we determined the estimated fair value of the catherines goodwill using the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the catherines assets 
we recorded a write down  which was not deductible for income tax purposes  of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its estimated fair value 
the majority of the write down was attributable to the value of unrecorded trademarks 
we also evaluated our goodwill  trademarks  tradenames  and internet domain names related to our lane bryant acquisition as of february  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 and determined that there was no impairment of those assets 
we have included the write down of the catherines goodwill as the cumulative effect of an accounting change as of february  in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal our calculation of the estimated fair value of the goodwill and other intangible assets required estimates  assumptions  and judgments  and results might have been materially different if other estimates  assumptions  and judgments had been used 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used were reasonable and appropriate 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we re evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment 
we performed this annual review during the fourth quarters of fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal and determined that there has been no additional impairment of these assets 
acquisitions purchase price allocation we account for acquisitions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations 
we assign to all identifiable assets acquired including intangible assets  and to all identifiable liabilities assumed  a portion of the cost of the acquired company equal to the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition 
we record the excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed  if any  as goodwill 
we make the initial purchase price allocation based on the evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined  we make appropriate adjustments to the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and make corresponding changes to the amount allocated to goodwill 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
we have  if necessary  up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation 
asset securitization asset securitization is a practice commonly used in the retail industry that allows companies with proprietary credit card programs to finance credit card receivables at attractive rates 
asset securitization primarily involves the sale of proprietary credit card receivables to a special purpose entity  which in turn transfers the receivables to a trust the trust that is a qualified special purpose entity qspe and is administered by an independent trustee 
we use asset securitization to fund the credit card receivables generated by our fashion bug credit card program 
the fashion bug credit cards are issued by spirit of america national bank  one of our subsidiaries 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  spirit of america national bank acquired the catherines proprietary credit card portfolio and the right to operate the program  and added the catherines credit card receivables to the trust 
because the trust qualifies as a qspe  its assets and liabilities are not consolidated in our balance sheet 
investors purchase various forms of certificates or credit card receivable interests the certificates issued by the trust that represent undivided interests in the trust s underlying assets 
the trust pays to the certificate holders a portion of future scheduled cash flows from the credit card receivables under preset terms and conditions 
payments to certificate holders are dependent upon actual cash flows generated by the underlying trust assets 
we retain subordinated interests in certain securitization transactions that effectively serve as a form of credit enhancement to the certificates sold to outside investors 
to the extent that cash flows to the trust from the credit card receivables remain available after repayment of the outside investors interests  such amounts are paid to us 
neither the investors nor the trust have recourse against us beyond the combination of trust assets and our subordinated interests  other than for breaches of certain customary representations  warranties  and covenants 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and related indemnities do not protect the trust or the outside investors against credit related losses on the receivables 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  we record an interest in the estimated present value of cash flows we expect to receive over the period the receivables are outstanding 
these cash flows essentially represent finance charges and late fees in excess of amounts paid to certificate holders  credit losses  and service fees  and are referred to as the interest only strip i o strip 
in addition to the i o strip  we recognize a servicing liability  since the servicing fees we expect to receive from the securitizations do not provide adequate compensation for servicing the receivables 
the servicing liability represents the present value of the excess of the costs of servicing over the servicing fees we expect to receive  and is recorded at estimated fair value 
since quoted market prices are generally not available  we determine the fair value of the costs of servicing by calculating all costs associated with billing  collecting  maintaining  and providing customer service during the expected life of the securitized credit card receivable balances 
we discount the costs in excess of the servicing fees we expect to collect over the estimated life of the receivables sold 
the discount rate and estimated life assumptions used in valuing the servicing liability are equivalent to those used in valuing the i o strip 
we amortize the i o strip and the servicing liability on a straight line basis over the expected life of the credit card receivables 
we use certain key valuation assumptions related to the average life of the receivables sold and anticipated credit losses  as well as the appropriate market discount rate in determining the estimated value of the i o strip and the servicing liability 
we estimate the values for these assumptions using historical data  the impact of the current economic environment on the performance of the receivables sold  and the impact of the potential volatility of the current market for similar instruments in assessing the fair value of the retained interests 
changes in the average life of the receivables sold  discount rate  and credit loss percentage could cause actual results to differ materially from the estimates  and changes in circumstances could result in significant future changes to the assumptions currently being used 
the following table presents the decrease in our i o strip receivable that would result from hypothetical adverse changes of and in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the i o strip in millions change change assumption payment rate residual cash flows discount rate credit loss percentage costs associated with exit or disposal activities we have traditionally recognized certain costs associated with restructuring plans as of the date of commitment to the plan  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullified eitf issue no 
under sfas no 
 we are required to recognize liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity initiated after december  when the liabilities are incurred 
commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
under sfas no 
 we are required to recognize severance pay over time rather than up front if the benefit arrangement requires employees to render future service beyond a minimum retention period 
the liability for severance pay is recognized as employees render service over the future service period  even if the benefit formula used to calculate an employee s termination benefit is based on length of service 
fair value should be used for initial measurement of liabilities under sfas no 
adoption of sfas no 
results in the deferral of recognition of certain costs for restructuring plans initiated subsequent to december   from the date of commitment to such a plan to the date that costs are incurred under the plan 
on march   we announced the implementation of a cost reduction plan see results of operations  comparison of fiscal to fiscal  expenses related to cost reduction plan below 
costs incurred in connection with the implementation of this plan have been accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor eitf issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  addresses the accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor  including both a reseller of the vendor s products and an entity that purchases the vendor s products from a reseller 
we adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
as of the beginning of fiscal we recognized a charge of million  net of income taxes of million  for the cumulative effect of the deferral of cash received from vendors as of the beginning of fiscal as of january  and january   million and million  respectively  of cash received from vendors has been deferred into inventory and will be recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold as inventory is sold 
stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  allows two alternatives for accounting for stock based compensation the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
companies electing to adopt the intrinsic value method are required to provide pro forma disclosures of the effect of adopting the fair value method 
we currently account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method 
we recognize compensation expense for stock options and stock awards that have an exercise price less than the market price of our common stock at the date of grant of the option or award 
we measure compensation expense based on the difference between the market price and the exercise price of an option or award at the date of grant 
this compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each option or award 
we do not recognize compensation expense for options having an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant or for shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
under the fair value method  we would be required to recognize compensation expense for all stock options and stock awards 
compensation would be measured based on an estimated fair value of the option or award  using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes or binomial pricing model 
these models require estimates or assumptions as to the dividend yield and price volatility of the underlying stock  the expected life of the option or award  and a relevant risk free interest rate 
for purposes of determining our pro forma disclosures of the effect of adopting the fair value method  we use the black scholes option pricing model and various assumptions that are detailed in item financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  note summary of significant accounting policies  common stock plans below 
the use of different option pricing models and different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different estimates of compensation expense under the fair value method

r 
insurance liabilities we use a combination of third party insurance and or self insurance for certain risks  including workers compensation  medical  dental  automobile  and general liability claims 
our insurance liabilities are a component of accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet  and represent our estimate of the ultimate cost of uninsured claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating our self insurance liabilities  we use independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analyses of historical data 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance liabilities could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
we evaluate the adequacy of these liabilities on a regular basis  modifying our assumptions as necessary  updating our records of historical experience  and adjusting our liabilities as appropriate 
operating leases we lease substantially all of our store properties and account for our store leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
a majority of our store leases contain lease options that we can unilaterally exercise 
the lease term we use for such operating leases includes lease option renewal periods only in instances in which the failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty for us and exercise of the renewal option is therefore reasonably assured at the lease inception date 
store leasehold improvement assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term  as determined above 
for leases that contain rent escalations  the lease term for recognition of straight line rent expense commences on the date we take possession of the leased property for construction purposes  which is generally two months prior to a store opening date 
similarly  landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases tenant improvement allowances are recorded as a deferred rent liability and recognized as a reduction of rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the date we take possession of the leased property for construction purposes

off balance sheet arrangements spirit of america national bank our wholly owned credit card bank transfers its interest in credit card receivables created under our fashion bug proprietary credit card program and  subsequent to the end of fiscal  receivables purchased and created under our catherines proprietary credit card program to the charming shoppes master trust the trust through a special purpose entity 
the trust is an unconsolidated qualified special purpose entity 
the trust can sell interests in these receivables on a revolving basis for a specified term 
at the end of the revolving period  an amortization period begins during which the trust makes principal payments to the parties that have entered into the securitization agreement with the trust 
as of january   the trust had the following securitization facilities outstanding dollars in millions series series series series series date of facility july may november january august type of facility term conduit term conduit term maximum funding funding as of january  first scheduled principal payment 
march not applicable august not applicable april expected final principal payment february not applicable may not applicable march renewal not applicable annual not applicable annual not applicable series and series have scheduled final payment dates that occur in the twelfth month following the month in which the series begins amortizing 
these series generally begin amortizing days after start of the purchase commitment by the series purchaser currently in effect 
the series securitization began its scheduled amortization period in march  and million of principal was amortized in fiscal the remaining million of principal was amortized in the fiscal first quarter and was funded with the proceeds available from series  which was issued on august  see below 
on august  the trust issued million of new five year asset backed certificates series in a private placement under rule a 
of the million of certificates issued  million were sold to investors  and we held million as a retained interest 
the certificates pay interest to investors on a floating rate basis tied to one month libor 
concurrently  the trust entered into a series of fixed rate interest rate hedge agreements with respect to the million of certificates sold to investors 
the blended weighted average interest rate on the hedged certificates is 
the trust used million of the proceeds to pay down other securitization series and placed the remaining proceeds of million into a pre funding cash account 
we are using the proceeds from this pre funding cash account to pay down series which is currently in its amortization period as well as provide financing for additional receivables  including the acquisition of the catherines proprietary credit card portfolio in march see below 
during the fiscal third and fourth quarters  the trust used million of cash from the pre funding cash account to fund the series amortization 
during fiscal  we sold to investors million of series certificates that we were previously holding as a retained interest 
these certificates were included in the million of short term available for sale securities we held at january  on august   we sold to investors million of the million of series certificates we held as a retained interest 
as these credit card receivables securitizations reach maturity  we plan to obtain funding for the fashion bug and catherines proprietary credit card programs through additional securitizations 
however  we can give no assurance that we will be successful in securing financing through either replacement securitizations or other sources of replacement financing 
we securitized million and million of credit card receivables in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and had million of securitized credit card receivables outstanding as of january  we held certificates and retained interests in our securitizations of million as of the end of fiscal  which were generally subordinated in right of payment to certificates issued by the trust to third party investors 
our obligation to repurchase receivables sold to the trust is limited to those receivables that  at the time of their transfer  fail to meet the trust s eligibility standards under normal representations and warranties 
to date  our repurchases of receivables pursuant to this obligation have been insignificant 
charming shoppes receivables corp 
csrc and charming shoppes seller  inc  our consolidated wholly owned indirect subsidiaries  are separate special purpose entities created for the securitization facilities 
as of january   csrc held million of charming shoppes master trust certificates and retained interests and charming shoppes seller  inc held retained interests of million which are included in the million of short term available for sale securities we held at january  
these assets are first and foremost available to satisfy the claims of the respective creditors of these separate corporate entities  including certain claims of investors in the charming shoppes master trust 
additionally  if either the trust or charming shoppes  inc fails to meet certain financial performance standards  the trust would be obligated to reallocate to third party investors holding certain certificates issued by the trust  collections in an amount up to million that otherwise would be available to csrc 
the result of this reallocation would be to increase csrc s retained interest in the trust by the same amount 
subsequent to such a transfer occurring  and upon certain conditions being met  these same investors would be required to repurchase these interests 
as of january   there were no reallocated collections as the result of a failure to meet these financial performance standards 
in addition to the above  we could be affected by certain other events that would cause the trust to hold proceeds of receivables  which would otherwise be available to be paid to us with respect to our subordinated interests  within the trust as additional enhancement 
for example  if we fail or the trust fails to meet certain financial performance standards  a credit enhancement condition would occur and the trust would be required to retain amounts otherwise payable to us 
in addition  the failure to satisfy certain financial performance standards could further cause the trust to stop using collections on trust assets to purchase new receivables  and would require such collections to be used to repay investors on a prescribed basis  as provided in the trust agreements 
if this were to occur  it could result in our having insufficient liquidity  however  we believe we would have sufficient notice to seek alternative forms of financing through other third party providers 
as of january   the trust was in compliance with all applicable financial performance standards 
amounts placed into enhancement accounts  if any  that are not required for payment to other certificate holders will be available to us at the termination of the securitization series 
we have no obligation to directly fund the enhancement account of the trust  other than for breaches of customary representations  warranties  and covenants and for customary indemnities 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and indemnities do not protect the trust or investors in the trust against credit related losses on the receivables 
the providers of the credit enhancements and trust investors have no other recourse to us 
these securitization agreements are intended to improve our overall liquidity by providing short term sources of funding 
the agreements provide that we will continue to service the credit card receivables and control credit policies 
this control allows us  absent certain adverse events  to fund continued credit card receivable growth and to provide the appropriate customer service and collection activities 
accordingly  our relationship with our credit card customers is not affected by these agreements

market risk we manage our fashion bug proprietary credit card program and  beginning in march  our catherines proprietary credit card program through various operating entities that we own 
the primary activity of these entities is to service the balances of our proprietary credit card receivables portfolio that we sell under credit card securitization facilities 
under the securitization facilities  we can be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent that the interest rates charged to our customers vary from the rates paid on certificates issued by the trust 
the finance charges on most of our proprietary credit card accounts are billed using a floating rate index the prime rate  subject to a floor and limited by legal maximums 
the certificates issued under the securitization include both floating and fixed interest rate certificates 
the floating rate certificates are based on an index of either one month libor or the commercial paper rate  depending on the issuance 
consequently  we have basis risk exposure to the extent that the movement of the floating rate index on the certificates varies from the movement of the prime rate 
additionally  as of january   the floating finance charge rate on the credit cards was below the contractual floor rate  thus exposing us to interest rate risk on the portion of certificates that are funded at floating rates 
in addition  as a result of the trust entering into a series of fixed rate interest rate hedge agreements with respect to the million of series certificates see off balance sheet financing above  we have significantly reduced the exposure of floating rate certificates outstanding to interest rate risk 
to the extent that short term interest rates were to increase by one percentage point by the end of fiscal  an increase of approximately thousand in selling  general  and administrative expenses would result 
as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent that there are borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  such borrowings would be exposed to variable interest rates 
an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and decrease our cash flows 
conversely  a decrease in market interest rates would decrease our interest expense and increase our cash flows 
we are not subject to material foreign exchange risk  as our foreign transactions are primarily us dollar denominated and our foreign operations do not constitute a material part of our business
