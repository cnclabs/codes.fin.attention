item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement amounts in thousands in march  in conjunction with the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended december   we concluded that certain policy riders were not reserved for in prior years 
the policy riders are options chosen by the policyholders and the previously unidentified policy riders include inflation  restoration of benefit and return of premium benefit 
a significant majority of these policy riders were inflation riders 
the premiums associated with the policies were properly billed and any claims incurred on these policies were properly paid 
however  the policy riders were not identified in the data utilized to calculate policy reserves 
as a result of this conclusion  we have restated our previously issued financial statements for the years ended december  and to reflect the inclusion of the policy riders and reduced shareholders equity by  as of january  to reflect the impact of the previously unidentified policy riders for prior years 
the total cumulative impact of the restatement that affected shareholders equity as of december  was a decrease in shareholders equity of  which includes a decrease in beginning shareholders equity as of january  of  the overall financial decrease on shareholders equity of the restatement as of each year end was as follows december   december   december  the adjustment as of december  represents an opening retained earnings adjustment on january  the adjustment represents the retained earning impact of the restatement to net income in the respective period 
as to the individual financial statement line items  our historical consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  reflect the effects of the restatement on i net policy acquisition costs amortized and its effects on unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs  ii benefits to policyholders expense and its effects on policy reserves  iii the federal income tax benefit and its effects of deferred income taxes and iv basic and diluted earnings per share

we have restated all pertinent historical information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies amounts in thousands  except per share data the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
management has made estimates in the past that we believed to be appropriate but were subsequently revised to reflect actual experience 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if o it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and o changes in the estimate or different estimated amounts that could have been selected could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
policy reserves our policies are accounted for as long duration policies 
as a result there are two components of the liabilities associated with our policies 
the first is a liability for future policyholder benefits  represented by the present value of future benefits less the present value of future premium collections 
in calculating these reserves we utilize assumptions  including estimates for persistency policies that do not terminate  morbidity claims expectations  interest rates  and premium rate increases 
these assumptions are estimated in the year a policy is issued 
once the assumptions are established  we continue to utilize those assumptions unless our assessment of deferred acquisition costs dac indicates that the current unamortized dac asset is not recoverable in future periods 
any variance from the assumptions established in the year a policy is issued could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the significant assumptions utilized in setting our future reserves for policyholder benefits are o a voluntary lapse rate that ranges from to  depending on the age of the policyholder and the number of years the policy has been in force 
the high end of the lapse rate range is for our more recently issued policies 
a significant majority of our policyholders are between the ages of to at the time we issue them a policy 
the lapse rates range from in the early duration for these policies down to in the later durations 
o morbidity based upon past company experience and industry data 
we also include an estimate for improving morbidity trends in the general population 
o the use of the select and ultimate  sex distinct  actuarial table for mortality 
o for policies issued in through  we use a interest rate to discount future experience 
for policies issued prior to  we use a interest discount rate 
o we also include an estimate of premium rate increases based on what we had planned to implement as of september  when we last revised our assumptions at the time we recorded an impairment to our dac 
long term care insurance has fixed annual premiums that can be adjusted only upon approval of the insurance departments of the states where the premiums were written 
the process for filing for premium rate increases requires us to demonstrate to the insurance department that expected claims experience is anticipated to exceed original assumptions 
the approval of premium rate increases is at the discretion of the insurance department 
we have filed and implemented premium rate increases on most of our in force policies 
we have and are continuing to file and implement additional premium rate increases on the majority of our policies issued prior to we have been successful in obtaining premium rate increases in the past 
however  there has been increased public and regulatory scrutiny over the practice of obtaining premium rate increases on long term care insurance 
we base our premium rate increase assumptions on our past experience and our expectations of the amounts of actual rate increases that we will be able to achieve 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the assumed level of rate increases  we could recognize an impairment in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition we are currently in litigation concerning the premium rate increases we have implemented  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
our assumptions remain unchanged in future periods regardless of actual experience unless we impair our dac due to an expected loss in future periods using updated assumptions for all of the above 
however  when actual experience differs from our expectations  the incremental difference between actual and expected results is recognized in the current period 
claim reserves the second component of the liabilities associated with our policies is a reserve we establish for incurred  either reported or not yet reported  claims 
this amount represents the benefits to be paid in the future for our current claims 
the significant assumptions utilized in establishing claim reserves are expectations about the duration  cost of care being reimbursed and incidence of claims and the interest rate utilized to discount the claim reserves 
these assumptions are based on our past experience  industry experience and current trends 
we establish our claim reserves in each period based upon our most currently available information and assumptions 
we use a discount rate of for claim reserves  which approximates the current yield to maturity of our assets 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate can cause our claim reserves to increase by approximately  as part of our monitoring of claims reserves  we compare actual results to our expectations 
any deviation from our expectations is recorded in the period in which the deviation occurs 
any changes in our estimates in the future may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
deferred acquisition costs in connection with the sale of our insurance policies  we defer and amortize a portion of the policy acquisition costs over the related premium paying periods of the life of the policy 
these costs include all expenses that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of the policy  including commissions  underwriting and other policy issue expenses 
the dac is determined using the same projected actuarial assumptions used in computing benefit reserves 
we regularly assess the recoverability of our unamortized dac asset through actuarial analysis 
to determine recoverability  the present value of anticipated future premiums less future costs and claims are added to current reserve balances 
if this amount is greater than the current unamortized dac then the dac is deemed recoverable 
if this amount is less than the current unamortized dac  then we impair our dac and record a charge in our current period results of operations 
the dac recoverability analysis includes our most recent assumptions for persistency  morbidity  interest rates  and premium rate increases  all or any of which may be different than the assumptions utilized in establishing our benefit reserves 
the significant assumptions utilized in the dac recoverability analysis that differ from our current assumptions for policy reserves and dac include o investment of future cash flows in instruments and at durations similar to our current investment mix  using current market interest rates for new investments new investments are assumed to average 
o an estimate that claims will improve due to the expected results from recently implemented and future planned improvements to our claims adjudication procedures 
o an estimate that the ultimate level of premium rate increases that will be approved and implemented will be higher than the originally assumed percentage of 
changes in one or a combination of these assumptions can produce significant volatility in the recoverability of dac 
litigation and contingencies we are involved in lawsuits relating to our operations 
these lawsuits include  but are not limited to  allegations as to improper sales practices in connection with the recent premium rate increases on our long term care policies 
we recognize an estimated loss for contingencies when we believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to litigation and contingency matters 
as time passes and additional facts and circumstances become known  our estimation of the probability of loss as well as our ability to reasonably estimate a loss may change 
the ultimate outcome of litigation and other contingencies could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position in the future 
deposit accounting for centre reinsurance agreement the centre reinsurance agreement is being accounted for utilizing deposit accounting for reinsurance contracts 
we are using deposit accounting because we believe the reinsurance contract does not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer will suffer a significant loss 
we assessed this long duration reinsurance contract using the reasonable possibility of significant loss criteria due to certain contract provisions that limit the risk to the reinsurer  including an aggregate limit of liability for the reinsurer  experience refund provisions  and expense and risk charges provided to the reinsurer 
we also entered into the reinsurance agreement with the intent of commuting the agreement at december   which further supports the use of deposit accounting 
we have established the accounting model for this reinsurance agreement assuming that we will commute the contract on december   the first available commutation date 
we intend  but are not required  to commute the agreement on the first commutation date 
we have significant incentive to commute the agreement on december  as the expense and risk charges applied to the notional experience account for the benefit of the reinsurer begin to escalate after that date and the reinsurer may exercise warrants at a common stock equivalent price of per share  representing approximately of the then outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
our current modeling and actuarial projections suggest that it is probable we will be able to commute the agreement  as planned  on december  in order to commute the agreement  our statutory capital following commutation must be sufficient to support the reacquired business in compliance with all statutory requirements 
upon commutation  we would receive cash or other liquid assets equaling the market value of our notional experience account from the reinsurer 
we would also record the necessary reserves for the business in our statutory financial statements 
our ability to commute the agreement is highly dependent upon the market value of the notional experience account exceeding the level of required reserves to be established 
as of december   the statutory basis reserve liabilities of  exceed the combination of the notional experience account value and funds held due to the reinsurer of  based upon our current modeling and actuarial projections  management believes it is probable that the value of the notional experience account will exceed the reserve liabilities at december  in addition to the performance of the reinsured policies from now until  the notional experience account value is susceptible to market interest rate changes 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the market value of the current notional experience account by approximately  and jeopardize our ability to commute as planned 
as we approach the intended commutation date  the sensitivity of our notional experience account to market interest rate movement will decline as the duration of the benchmark indices becomes shorter  however  the amount of assets susceptible to such interest sensitivity will continue to grow as additional net cash flows are added to the experience account balance prior to commutation 
the reinsurer has agreed to fix the market value of the experience account and to invest the assets in a manner that we request in order to minimize short term volatility when we inform the reinsurer of our intention to commute the agreement 
as a result of our intention to commute  we considered only the expense and risk charges anticipated prior to the commutation date in our unamortized dac recoverability analyses and have not recorded the potential of future escalating charges 
in the event we determine that commutation of the reinsurance agreement is unlikely on december   but likely at some future date  we will include additional annual expense and risk charge credits against our notional experience account in our dac recoverability analysis 
as a result  we could impair the value of our dac asset and record the impairment in our financial statements 
however  we currently believe that it is probable we will have sufficient statutory capital and surplus to commute the reinsurance agreement on december  or that other alternatives  such as new reinsurance opportunities or  additional capital issuances will be available to enable us to commute the agreement as planned 
as part of our reinsurance agreement  effective december   the reinsurer was granted four tranches of warrants to purchase shares of non voting convertible preferred stock 
the first three tranches of warrants are exercisable through december  at common stock equivalent prices ranging from to per share 
if exercised and converted  the convertible preferred stock would represent approximately of the then outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis 
if the agreement is not commuted on december   the reinsurer may exercise the fourth tranche of convertible preferred stock purchase warrants at a common stock equivalent price of per share  which if converted would represent an additional of the then outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
we are recognizing the additional consideration of entering into the agreement  represented by the fair value of the warrants granted to the reinsurer  over the period of time to the expected commutation date 
notional experience account our centre reinsurance agreement includes a provision for the maintenance of a notional experience account for our benefit in the event we elect to  and are able to  commute the reinsurance agreement in the future 
the notional experience account balance was  as of december  we receive a return on the experience account that is based on a series of benchmark indices and derivative hedges 
the benchmark indices are comprised of us treasury strips  agencies  and investment grade corporate bonds with weightings of approximately  and  respectively  and a duration of approximately years 
we believe the return on the notional experience account represents a hybrid instrument  containing both a fixed debt host and an embedded derivative  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we are accounting for the investment return on the experience account as follows a 
the fixed debt host yields a fixed return based upon the yield to maturity of the underlying benchmark indices 
the return on the fixed debt host is reported as investment income in the statements of income and comprehensive income 
b 
the change in fair value of the embedded derivative represents the percentage change in the underlying indices applied to the notional experience account  similar to that of an unrealized gain loss on a bond 
the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative is reported as market gain or loss on notional experience account in the statements of income and comprehensive income 
our conclusion that the return on the notional experience account represents a hybrid instrument with an embedded derivative is based on our belief that the economic characteristics and risk of the fixed debt host contract are not clearly and closely related to those of the embedded derivative 
when we determine the yield on the fixed debt host and the value of the embedded derivate  we reconcile these amounts to the amount credited to the experience account by the reinsurer  as we believe the actual return credited by the reinsurer should equal the sum of the amounts recognized in our statements of income and comprehensive income 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the market value of the current notional experience account by approximately  and jeopardize our ability to commute as planned 
as we approach the intended commutation date  the sensitivity of our experience account to market interest rate movement will decline as the duration of the benchmark indices becomes shorter  however  the amount of assets susceptible to such interest sensitivity will continue to grow as additional net cash flows are added to the experience account balance prior to commutation 
we intend to give notice to the reinsurer of our intention to commute on december  at such time as we are highly confident of our ability to support the reacquired policies 
the reinsurer has agreed to fix the market value of the experience account at that time  and to then invest the assets in a manner that we request in order to minimize short term volatility 
goodwill the balance of our goodwill was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the goodwill at both december  and relates to the purchase of our insurance agencies  uig and nishd 
we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis unless an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that an impairment has occurred 
during we performed our impairment test on a quarterly basis due to declining sales 
the test is done at a reporting unit level  which combines the operations of uig and nishd 
uig and nishd are both insurance agencies that sell senior market insurance products  and therefore have similar economic characteristics 
during our quarterly impairment test as of december   we determined that the goodwill related to the agency reporting unit was impaired 
this impairment was a result of declining sales  particularly in the fourth quarter of  which led to lower than planned net income at the reporting unit level 
the decline in sales is attributable to a decline in sales across the long term care industry during as a result of higher priced policies and the negative impact of premium rate increases that have been implemented on previously issued policies 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined utilizing the present value of cash flows  which includes assumptions for future growth in sales 
during the most recent impairment test  we lowered the assumptions related to future sales growth and as a result recognized an impairment of  in the valuation is sensitive to future growth in sales of insurance policies  the persistency of the renewal commission stream and expense savings initiatives that we have implemented 
we utilized a discount rate in the goodwill analysis 
we assume that our agencies are capable of future growth from both the sale of our products and from the sale of other carriers products 
our future growth assumptions now range from in the first years and stabilize at in the later years of our analysis 
the growth rates in the early years are dependent upon the ability of our agencies to execute on recently signed agreements with unaffiliated insurance companies and to sell policies underwritten by our insurance subsidiaries especially in states such as california where we have recently received approval to sell our products 
our insurance subsidiaries have recommenced sales in states since february  after the cessation of sales in september the goodwill analysis for our agencies is sensitive to the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to successfully supply product that is competitive and to improve their financial strength ratings 
future growth in sales is also dependent upon recent contracts to sell insurance products of unaffiliated insurance companies 
if the future growth in sales or expense savings initiatives do not occur as we anticipate  we may realize an additional impairment in the goodwill allocated to the agency operations in the future 
preferred interest on early conversion holders of our convertible subordinated notes are entitled to convert their notes into shares of our common stock before october and receive a discounted amount of interest that they would have otherwise received until that date 
we may elect to pay this interest in cash or in newly issued shares of common stock 
if we elect to pay in newly issued shares of common stock  the stock is valued at a discount to the then fair market value of traded shares 
we have determined that this feature is an embedded derivative as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host contract  the convertible subordinated notes  because it could at least double the investor s initial rate of return on the host contract and could also result in a rate of return that is at least twice what otherwise would be the market return for a contract that has the same terms as the host contract and that involves a debtor with a similar credit quality 
as a result of this determination  we have separately valued and bifurcated the embedded derivative from the host contract 
at each balance sheet date  the embedded derivative must be recorded at fair value  with any change in fair value recognized in current operations 
as of december  the fair value of the embedded derivative was  in determining the fair value of the embedded derivative  we make certain assumptions  including the future volatility and liquidity of the company s common stock 
we believe the liquidity of the stock significantly impacts the assumed value of the embedded derivative due to the ability of a converting holder to liquidate the shares and recognize its intended value 
we also take into consideration recent trends in the number of holders converting 
if we assumed that all holders converted on december   without giving any consideration to the relationship of the current share price to the conversion price or to the impact of this level of conversions on the stock price  the value of the embedded derivative would be  if actual experience differs from our current assumptions  our results of operations may be subject to significant volatility in future periods 
valuation allowance for income taxes we have net operating loss carryforwards of  or  on a tax effected basis  which have been generated by taxable losses at the parent company  and if unused will expire between and we have net operating loss carryforwards of  or  on a tax effected basis  which have been generated by taxable losses at our insurance subsidiaries  and if unused  will expire in the parent company s net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized by our insurance subsidiaries  subject to a limitation equal to the lesser of of the insurance subsidiary taxable income or of the current aggregate carryforward amount 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  against our net operating loss carryforwards on a tax affected basis 
we recorded the valuation allowance due to a change in ownership as defined in the internal revenue code 
as a result of the change in ownership we are now subject to a limitation on the amount of prior period net operating loss carryforwards we can utilize 
if we do not generate enough taxable income in the future we may need to record an additional valuation allowance  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
overview our principal products are individual  defined benefit accident and health insurance policies that consist of nursing home care  home health care and medicare supplement 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the states in which they are licensed to write insurance 
these laws and regulations govern matters such as payment of dividends  settlement of claims and loss ratios 
state regulatory authorities must approve premiums charged for insurance products 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries are required to establish and maintain reserves with respect to reported and incurred but not reported claims  as well as estimated future benefits payable under our insurance policies 
these reserves must  at a minimum  comply with mandated standards 
our reserves are certified annually by our consulting actuary as to standards required by the insurance departments for our domiciliary states and for the other states in which we conduct business 
we believe we maintained adequate reserves as mandated by each state in which we are currently writing business at december  results of operations twelve months ended december  and certain amounts related to have been restated to reflect the impact of previously unreserved policy riders amounts in thousands premium revenue 
total premium revenue earned in the twelve months ended december   including long term care  disability  life and medicare supplement  decreased to  compared to  in the same period in effective september   we discontinued the sale nationally of all new long term care insurance policies until the corrective action plan the plan was completed and approved by the pennsylvania insurance department the department 
upon the department s approval of the plan in february  we recommenced new policy sales in states  including pennsylvania 
we are now approved to recommence new policy sales in additional states  including florida and california subject to corrective orders 
these states accounted for approximately in aggregate of our total direct premium revenue in florida  california and pennsylvania accounted for approximately  and  respectively of our direct premium revenue in we are working with the remaining states to recommence new policy sales in all jurisdictions 
total first year premium revenue earned in increased to  compared to  in first year long term care premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in we believe that the increase in first year premiums is due to the recommencement of sales in additional states during  the engagement of additional independent agents that had not previously sold our policies  and the introduction of our new products  which have higher annual premiums than our previously sold products 
we anticipate that first year premium revenue will continue to increase as independent agents that sold our policies prior to the cessation of sales are reengaged and independent agents that had not previously sold our policies are recruited 
we also anticipate that we will recommence sales in additional states in which we are currently not writing new business 
total renewal premium revenue earned in decreased to  compared to  in renewal long term care premiums earned in decreased to  compared to  in the decrease in renewal premium revenue is due to the lapsation of existing policies and a reduced level of new premium levels compared to periods prior to the cessation of sales in l 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience reduced levels of renewal premium revenue until such time as an increased level of new premiums is sufficient to offset the lapsation of existing policies 
our persistency was and in and  respectively 
net investment income 
net investment income earned in increased to  from  in our average yield on invested assets at cost  including cash and cash equivalents  was and  in and  respectively

the notional experience account yields a fixed return based upon the yield to maturity of the underlying benchmark indices  which are comprised of us treasury strips  government agencies and investment grade corporate bonds with weightings of approximately  and  respectively  and have duration of approximately years 
the average yield on the notional experience account was and in and  respectively 
market gain loss on notional experience account 
we recorded a gain on our notional experience account of  in compared to a market loss of  in during the interest rates on the underlying investments in the benchmark indices supporting our notional experience account were lower at the end of the year compared to the beginning of the year  resulting in a market gain 
during  although interest rates were volatile during the year  interest rates at the beginning and end of the year were relatively unchanged 
the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index was and in and  respectively 
the total return on our notional experience account  which generates the majority of our net investment income  was and in and  respectively 
management attributes the favorable return achieved from its notional experience account in to the impact of declining market interest rates upon the long duration of the underlying benchmark indices 
in  market interest rates remained stable  producing an immaterial impact upon the total market return of the notional experience account 
change in preferred interest on early conversion 
the fair value of the embedded derivative as of the date that the option to receive discounted interest was granted was  due to the issuance of additional convertible debt in february and november of  we recorded an additional  representing the fair values of these embedded derivatives 
as of december   we adjusted the embedded derivative to its then fair value of  by recording a gain of  compared to a loss of in we believe that the value of the embedded derivative is significantly affected by the ability of the investor to liquidate their shares in the market 
we further believe that the number of shares of our common stock outstanding and the average daily trading volume of our common stock provide an indication of the ability for the market to bear additional sales of stock without a material reduction of the current market value of those shares 
the value decreased in as a result of  of conversions and the decrease in the value of the interest we would pay upon the conversion due to the shortening of the time period between the date of conversion and october during  the liquidity of our common stock rose significantly  as did the average daily trading volume  which indicated that the market could absorb additional shares without significant reduction of the market price 
as a result  we increased our estimates of the value of the embedded derivative based on an assumption that conversions were more likely to occur without stock price deflation 
in determining the fair value of the embedded derivative  the company makes certain assumptions  including the future volatility and liquidity of the company s common stock 
if actual experience deviates from current assumptions  our financial results may be significantly impacted in future periods 
other income 
we recorded  in other income in  as compared to  in the income generated from our ownership of corporate owned life insurance policies decreased to in  as compared to  in the cash value of these policies is invested in investment grade corporate bonds and equity indexes 
we receive a crediting rate net of insurance costs and fees for maintaining a stable value of the assets  which was reduced significantly during due to deterioration in the underlying bond and equity investments of the funds supporting the coli 
in addition  the average balance decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in due to death benefit payments 
the average yield on the income generated from the corporate owned life insurance was in  compared to in the commission income related to our agency subsidiaries decreased to  in compared to  in this decrease was a result of lower sales in  primarily related to the sale of long term care insurance 
the long term care industry experienced a decrease in new policy sales in compared to benefits to policyholders 
has been restated to reflect the impact of previously unreserved policy riders 
total benefits to policyholders in decreased to  compared to  in our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in  compared to in we believe the improvement in the loss ratio is primarily due to the impact of premium rate increases  changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our claim reserves and improved claims adjudication procedures implemented during and we establish reserves for current claims based upon current and historical experience of our policyholder benefits  including an expectation of claims incidence and duration  as well as the establishment of a reserve for claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported ibnr 
we continuously monitor our experience to determine the best estimate of reserves to be held for future payments of these claims 
as a result  we periodically refine our process to incorporate the most recent known information in establishing these reserves 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
we compare actual experience with estimates and adjust reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
we evaluate our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period 
during  reserve amounts relating to december  and prior had a favorable development of  compared to a favorable development of  during for reserve amounts relating to december  and prior 
these changes to prior year reserve amounts particularly when calculated as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance provide a relative measure of deviation in actual performance as compared to our initial assumptions 
the adjustments to reserves for claims incurred in prior periods are primarily attributable to claims incurred from our long term care insurance policies  which represent approximately of our premium in force 
the favorable development in is attributable to refinements to the model we utilized to calculate claim reserves  including the addition of diagnosis code data  payment frequency data  and further delineation of policy forms for purposes of evaluation of existing continuance tables 
as a result claims reserves were reduced by approximately  an increase in the discount rate used for claims reserves from to  reflecting our improved investment portfolio performance  which reduced reserves by approximately  during  fewer claims that were closed as of december  reopened than we had estimated  resulting in a reduction of approximately  and claim reserve adjudication process improvements implemented in the second half of and throughout the development of our prior year assumptions were in line with our expectations for commissions 
commissions to agents decreased to  in  compared to  in first year commissions on accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  primarily due to the increase in first year accident and health premiums 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in and in the first year commission ratio for both and is lower than the first year commission ratio prior to the cessation of sales in  due to the increased sale of our secured risk  medicare supplement and franchise group policies as a percentage of total new sales 
all of these policies pay a lower commission as a percentage of premium revenue to agents than our individual long term care policies 
we believe that sales of these policies as a percentage of new sales are likely to decrease as our total sales increase  resulting in an increase in this ratio 
we believe that the sale of long term care policies has declined as a percentage of sales as a result of our lower financial ratings with am best and standard and poor s rating services and continued consumer and agent concerns regarding our financial strength 
renewal commissions on accident and health business in decreased to  compared to  in due to the decrease in renewal accident and health premiums 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in and in we have implemented premium rate increases on a majority of policies written prior to december  we do not pay commissions on the additional premium collected as a result of a rate increase  which reduces the ratio of renewal commissions to renewal premium revenue 
we anticipate that this ratio will continue to decline until the premium rate increases are fully implemented  which we anticipate will occur prior to the end of net policy acquisition costs amortized 
has been restated to reflect the impact of previously unreserved policy riders 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs amortized in increased to  compared to  in deferred costs are typically all costs that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of new premiums 
these costs include the variable portion of commissions  which are defined as the first year commissions less ultimate renewal commissions  and variable general and administrative expenses related to policy sales  underwriting and issuance 
deferred costs are amortized over the life of the policy based upon actuarial assumptions  including persistency of policies in force 
in the event that a policy lapses prematurely due to death or termination of coverage  the remaining unamortized portion of the deferred amount is immediately recognized as expense in the current period 
the net amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is affected by new business generation  imputed interest on prior reserves and policy persistency 
the amortization of deferred costs is generally offset largely by the deferral of costs associated with new premium generation 
however  lower new premium sales during the and periods  as compared to sales prior to the cessation of new sales in  produced significantly less expense deferral to offset amortized costs 
we regularly assess the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs through actuarial analysis 
to determine recoverability  the present value of future premiums less future costs and claims are added to current reserve balances 
if this amount is greater than current unamortized deferred acquisition costs  the unamortized amount is deemed recoverable 
in the event recoverability is not demonstrated  we reassess the calculation using justifiable premium rate increases 
if rate increases are not received or are deemed unjustified  we will expense  as impaired  the attributed portion of the deferred asset in the current period 
if we conclude that the deferred acquisition costs are impaired  we will record an impairment loss and a reduction in the deferred acquisition cost asset 
in the event of an impairment  we will also evaluate our historical assumptions utilized in establishing the policy reserves and deferred acquisition costs and may update those assumptions to reflect current experience referred to as unlocking 
the primary assumptions include persistency  claims expectations  interest rates and rate increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in decreased to  compared to  in the ratio of total general and administrative expenses to premium revenues was in  compared to in in we recorded expenses of  related to the initial recognition of future retirement benefits payable to our former chairman and severance related expenses for certain managers and employees whose positions were eliminated 
we did not have a similar charge in expenses at one of our agency subsidiaries were approximately  less in than in due to reductions in staff and the closing of certain unprofitable agency offices 
legal fees were approximately less in than due to a reduction in activity related to our litigation 
outside actuarial fees were approximately  less in than in as the combination of less premium rate increase filings and increased internal staffing levels served to reduce reliance on outside parties 
also in there was a reduction in expenses related to the implementation of internally developed software of approximately while we were in the process of choosing a new vendor 
these reductions were partially offset by increases in variable costs related to increased sales levels 
impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill at both december  and relates to the purchase of our insurance agencies  uig and nishd 
we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis unless an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that an impairment has occurred 
we tested for impairment on a quarterly basis during due to declining sales 
the test is done at a reporting unit level  which combines the operations of uig and nishd 
uig and nishd are both insurance agencies that sell senior market insurance products  and therefore have similar economic characteristics 
during our quarterly impairment test as of december   we determined that the goodwill related to the agency reporting unit was impaired 
this impairment was a result of declining sales  particularly in the fourth quarter of  which led to lower than planned net income at the reporting unit level 
the decline in sales is attributable to a decline in sales across the long term care industry during as a result of higher priced policies and the negative impact of premium rate increases that have been implemented on previously issued policies 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined utilizing the present value of cash flows  which includes assumptions for future growth in sales 
during the most recent impairment test  we lowered the assumptions related to future sales growth and as a result recognized an impairment of  in there was no impairment recognized in litigation settlement expense 
during  we accrued  related to the anticipated resolution of two lawsuits related the sale of long term care policies 
in addition  we accrued  related to the settlement of a separate lawsuit

expense and risk charges on reinsurance and excise tax expense 
our reinsurance agreement provides the reinsurer with annual expense and risk charges  which are credited against our notional experience account in the event of future commutation of the agreement 
the annual charge consists of a fixed cost and a variable component based upon reserve and capital levels needed to support the reinsured business 
in and  we incurred charges of  and  respectively for this item 
in addition  we are subject to an excise tax for premium payments made to a foreign reinsurer equal to one percent of the premium revenue ceded to the foreign reinsurer 
we recorded  and  for excise tax expenses in and  respectively 
we anticipate that this expense will continue to decrease as policies issued prior to january  continue to lapse  resulting in the ceding of a lower amount of premium revenue to the foreign reinsurer 
interest expense 
interest expense in increased to  compared to  in during february and november of  we issued  and  respectively of additional convertible subordinated notes 
during  we issued  of additional convertible subordinated notes and paid our entire obligation of  related to convertible subordinated notes that matured in our average outstanding convertible subordinated debt for was  compared to  in the amount of interest expense related to the outstanding principal balance was  and  in and  respectively 
holders of our convertible subordinated notes are entitled to convert their notes into shares of our common stock before october and receive a discounted amount of interest that they would have otherwise received through october had they not converted the notes 
we incurred  and  of interest expense from the early conversion of  and  in convertible subordinated notes during and  respectively 
the  of convertible subordinated notes issued in november of  were issued when the price of our common stock was per share 
because this price exceeded the conversion price of per share  we recorded additional interest expense of in provision benefit for federal income taxes 
has been restated to reflect the impact of previously unreserved policy riders 
in  we recorded a provision for federal income taxes of  compared to a benefit from federal income taxes of  in the effective tax rate was in compared to in in  the effective tax rate utilized to record our provision for federal income taxes was higher than our statutory tax rate of primarily due to the impairment charge recorded against the goodwill of uig  which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
in  the effective tax rate utilized to record our benefit from federal income taxes was lower than our statutory rate due to the valuation allowance we recorded 
twelve months ended december  and certain amounts related to and have been restated to reflect the impact of previously unreserved policy riders 
amounts in thousands premium revenue 
total premium revenue earned in the twelve months ended december   including long term care  disability  life and medicare supplement  decreased to  compared to  in the same period in total first year premium revenue earned in increased to  compared to  in first year long term care premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in we anticipate that first year premium revenue will continue to increase as independent agents that sold our policies prior to the cessation of sales are reengaged and independent agents that had not previously sold our policies are recruited 
we also anticipate that we will recommence sales in additional states in which we are currently not writing new business 
total renewal premium revenue earned in decreased to  compared to  in renewal long term care premiums earned in decreased to  compared to  in the decrease in renewal premium revenue is due to the lapsation of existing policies and a reduced level of new premium levels compared to periods prior to the cessation of sales in l 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience reduced levels of renewal premium revenue until such time as an increased level of new premiums is sufficient to offset the lapsation of existing policies 
our persistency was and for the and periods  respectively 
the persistency in was significantly affected due to high lapses after the implementation of premium rate increases 
net investment income 
net investment income earned in increased to  from  in as a result of our centre agreement  substantially all of our investments generated from business written prior to december  were transferred to the reinsurer in february the reinsurer maintains a notional experience account on our behalf in the event that the reinsurance agreement is later commuted 
the notional experience account is credited with an investment credit equal to the most recent yield to maturity of a series of benchmark indices and derivative hedges  which are designed to closely match the duration of our liabilities 
our average yield on invested assets at cost  including cash and cash equivalents  was and  respectively  in and the investment income component of our notional experience account investment credit generated  and  in and  respectively 
the notional experience account yields a fixed return based upon the yield to maturity of the underlying benchmark indices  which are comprised of us treasury strips  government agencies and investment grade corporate bonds with weightings of approximately  and  respectively  and have duration of approximately years 
the average yield on the notional experience account was and for and  respectively 
net realized capital gains and trading account activity 
during  our capital gains were  compared to capital gains of  in we accounted for the transfer of the securities portion of the initial premium payment for our centre agreement during as a sale of these assets 
substantially all of the recognized capital gains in resulted from the transfer of the initial premium of approximately  to the reinsurer 
the results in were recorded due to normal investment management activity 
market gain loss on notional experience account 
we recorded a loss on our notional experience account of  in compared to a market gain of  in during the interest rates on the underlying investments in the benchmark indices supporting our notional experience account were declining  resulting in a market gain 
during  although interest rates were volatile during the year  interest rates at the beginning and end of the year were relatively unchanged 
the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index was and for and  respectively 
the total return on our notional experience account  which generates the majority of our net investment income  was and in and  respectively 
management attributes the favorable return achieved from its notional experience account in to a longer duration of the underlying benchmark indices  which were positively impacted by declining market interest rates during the lower interest rates that caused the gains in produced lower yields in change in preferred interest on early conversion 
the fair value of the embedded derivative as of the date that the option to receive discounted interest was granted was  as of december   we adjusted the embedded derivative to its then fair value of  by recording a loss of we believe that the value of the embedded derivative is significantly affected by the ability of the investor to liquidate their shares in the market 
we further believe that the number of shares of our common stock outstanding and the average daily trading volume of our common stock provide an indication of the ability for the market to bear additional sales of stock without a material degradation of the current market value of those shares 
during  the liquidity of our common stock rose significantly  as did the average daily trading volume  which indicated to us that the market could absorb additional shares without significant degradation of the market price 
as a result  we increased our estimates of the value of the embedded derivative based on an assumption that conversions were more likely to occur without stock price deflation 
in determining the fair value of the embedded derivative  the company makes certain assumptions  including the future volatility and liquidity of the company s common stock 
if actual experience deviates from current assumptions  our financial results may be significantly impacted in future periods 
other income 
we recorded  in other income during  as compared to  in in  we recorded approximately as other income related to the recognition of a deferred gain relating to the sale of our disability business  as compared to  in the sale was done as a quota share agreement  in contemplation of a subsequent assumption of the business  where actual ownership of the policies would change 
the gain on the sale is recognized as the ownership of the policies changes 
in addition  the income generated from our ownership of corporate owned life insurance policies decreased to  in  as compared to  in the cash value of these policies is invested in investment grade corporate bonds and equity indexes 
the average yield on the income generated from the corporate owned life insurance was in  compared to in benefits to policyholders 
restated to reflect the impact of previously unreserved policy riders 
total benefits to policyholders in decreased to  compared to  in our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in  compared to in excluding the impact of a refinement of our assumptions and processes and a change in interest discounting  our loss ratio in was approximately compared to the loss ratio of 
we believe the improvement in the loss ratio is primarily due to the impact of premium rate increases and better than anticipated development of our claim reserves for prior year incurrals 
we establish reserves for current claims based upon current and historical experience of our policyholder benefits  including an expectation of claims incidence and duration  as well as the establishment of a reserve for claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported ibnr 
we continuously monitor our experience to determine the best estimate of reserves to be held for future payments of these claims 
as a result  we periodically refine our process to incorporate the most recent known information in establishing these reserves 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
we compare actual experience with estimates and adjust reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
we evaluate our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period 
during  reserves amounts relating to december  and prior had a favorable development of  compared to an unfavorable development of  during for reserve amounts relating to december  and prior 
these changes to prior year reserve amounts particularly when calculated as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance provide a relative measure of deviation in actual performance as compared to our initial assumptions 
the adjustments to reserves for claims incurred in prior periods are primarily attributable to claims incurred from our long term care insurance policies  which represent approximately of our premium in force 
the development of our prior year assumptions were in line with our expectations and included the reduction of our claim reserves of approximately  in the quarter ended june  the reduction related to new claims adjudication procedures for family member and private caregiver services  following an internal review of historic home health care claims and external consultant guidance 
the new protocols include increased in home assessments and additional plan of care structure 
during we refined our assumptions and process for developing our claim reserves 
this included redefining certain multiple claims as a single claim and employing new assumptions and processes for predicting the continuance  or the likelihood of a claim continuing in the future 
this resulted in an increase to claims reserves of approximately  further we employed a lower discount rate of in  which increased our claims reserves by approximately  we believe that  as a result of lower market interest rates  the lower discount rate more closely matched our anticipated return from the investment of assets supporting these reserves 
commissions 
commissions to agents decreased to  in  compared to  in first year commissions on accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  due to the increase in first year accident and health premiums 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in and in the first year commission ratio for both the and is lower than the first year commission ratio prior to the cessation of sales in  due to the increased sale of our secured risk  medicare supplement and franchise group policies as a percentage of total new sales 
all of these policies pay a lower commission as a percentage of premium revenue to agents than our individual long term care policies 
we believe that sales of these policies as a percentage of new sales are likely to remain at this level as we recommence sales in many states 
we believe that the sale of long term care policies has declined as a percentage of sales as a result of our lower financial ratings with am best and standard and poor s rating services and continued consumer and agent concerns regarding our financial strength 
renewal commissions on accident and health business in decreased to  compared to  in due to the decrease in renewal accident and health premiums 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in and in we have implemented premium rate increases on a majority of policies written prior to december  we do not pay commissions on the additional premium collected as a result of a rate increase  which reduces the ratio of renewal commissions to renewal premium revenue 
we anticipate that this ratio will continue to decline until the premium rate increases are fully implemented  which we anticipate will occur prior to the end of net policy acquisition costs amortized 
restated to reflect the impact of previously unreserved policy riders 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs amortized in increased  compared to  in deferred costs are typically all costs that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of new premiums 
these costs include the variable portion of commissions  which are defined as the first year commissions less ultimate renewal commissions  and variable general and administrative expenses related to policy sales  underwriting and issuance 
deferred costs are amortized over the life of the policy based upon actuarial assumptions  including persistency of policies in force 
in the event that a policy lapses prematurely due to death or termination of coverage  the remaining unamortized portion of the deferred amount is immediately recognized as expense in the current period 
the net amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is affected by new business generation  imputed interest on prior reserves and policy persistency 
the amortization of deferred costs is generally offset largely by the deferral of costs associated with new premium generation 
however  lower new premium sales during and periods  as compared to sales prior to the cessation of new sales in  produced significantly less expense deferral to offset amortized costs 
we regularly assess the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs through actuarial analysis 
to determine recoverability  the present value of future premiums less future costs and claims are added to current reserve balances 
if this amount is greater than current unamortized deferred acquisition costs  the unamortized amount is deemed recoverable 
in the event recoverability is not demonstrated  we reassess the calculation using justifiable premium rate increases 
if rate increases are not received or are deemed unjustified  we will expense  as impaired  the attributed portion of the deferred asset in the current period 
if we conclude that the deferred acquisition costs are impaired  we will record an impairment loss and a reduction in the deferred acquisition cost asset 
in the event of an impairment  we will also evaluate our historical assumptions utilized in establishing the policy reserves and deferred acquisition costs and may update those assumptions to reflect current experience referred to as unlocking 
the primary assumptions include persistency  claims expectations  interest rates and rate increases 
during  we determined to recognize a dac impairment charge of  primarily as a result of the incorporation of certain assumptions related to the future profitability of our current business in force 
these assumptions included the use of a lower discount rate  which reflects the current interest rate environment  higher anticipated claims costs due to newly estimated claim duration and reasonable expected future premium rate increases on policies for which we have already filed or anticipate filing 
in the event that premium rate increases cannot be obtained as needed  or our actual experience differs from our assumptions  our dac could be further impaired and we would incur an expense in the amount of the impairment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in increased to  compared to  in the ratio of total general and administrative expenses to premium revenues was in  compared to in the primary contributors to our expense growth in were as follows new sales related expenses as our new premium revenue has increased with the recommencement of sales  the variable costs associated with marketing and acquiring new premium revenue has also increased 
these costs which include medical records and cognitive impairment screenings associated with the underwriting process  printing  supplies and sales promotions were  in  compared to  in in addition to the variable costs associated with new premium growth we also increased our marketing infrastructure during through the addition of a chief marketing officer  a national sales vice president and two additional field vice presidents 
the salaries and benefits associated with these new positions was in expenses increased approximately  in compared to at one of our agency subsidiaries  primarily because it had expanded its regional office structure in order to increase its ability to sell additional new long term care policies that we and other companies offer 
we determined that certain of these offices are not generating sufficient additional revenue to support existing overhead  and  as a result closed several unproductive sites prior to december  and closed additional sites in financial and actuarial capability we added two actuarial officers and three finance officers during and these positions were added in order to enhance our abilities to analyze our business through the use of customized actuarial models and to improve our financial analysis capabilities 
the salaries and benefits associated with these new positions were in as compared to in human resource modifications during we recorded expense of approximately  related to the initial recognition of future retirement benefits payable to our former chairman and severance related expenses for certain managers and employees whose positions were eliminated 
in addition  salary increases  changes in our vacation policy  increases in the cost of healthcare and officer bonuses increased salary and benefit expense by approximately  in litigation expenses legal fees increased to  in  compared to  in the increase related to expenses associated with the discovery process and the completion of depositions in the national healthcare services  inc litigation  and expenses associated with numerous motions filed and preliminary discovery conducted in connection with litigation related to the sale of long term care policies 
expense and risk charges on reinsurance and excise tax expense 
our reinsurance agreement provides the reinsurer with annual expense and risk charges  which are credited against our notional experience account in the event of future commutation of the agreement 
the annual charge consists of a fixed cost and a variable component based upon reserve and capital levels needed to support the reinsured business 
in and  we incurred charges of  and  respectively for this item 
in addition  we are subject to an excise tax for premium payments made to a foreign reinsurer equal to one percent of the premium revenue ceded to the foreign reinsurer 
we recorded  and  for excise tax expenses in and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense in increased to  compared to  in the interest expense in is primarily related to our convertible subordinated notes  which pay interest at an annual percentage rate of and had an outstanding aggregate principal balance of  throughout during  we issued  of additional convertible subordinated notes and paid our entire obligation of  related to convertible subordinated notes that matured in our average outstanding convertible subordinated debt for was  holders of our convertible subordinated notes are entitled to convert their notes into shares of our common stock before october and receive a discounted amount of interest that they would have otherwise received through october had they not converted the notes 
as a result of additional issuances of notes  interest expense in increased  in addition  we incurred  of interest expense from the early conversion of  in convertible subordinated notes during benefit for federal income taxes 
restated to reflect the impact of previously unreserved policy riders 
our benefit for federal income taxes for decreased to  compared  for our effective tax rate decreased to in compared to in the decrease in the effective rate is due to a  valuation allowance we recorded in for a portion of our current tax net operating loss carryforwards as a result of potential future limitations on their use due to internal revenue code section the internal revenue service has established rules that potentially limit a company s use of prior period net operating loss carryforwards in the event that a majority of the company s common stock ownership changes within any three year period 
due to the issuance of additional shares of our common stock since may and conversions of our convertible subordinated notes during and the first quarter of  we have become subject to these limitations 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
we recognized an impairment loss of  in as a result of our transitional impairment test of goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands our consolidated liquidity requirements have historically been met from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries  from our agency subsidiaries and from funds raised in the capital markets 
our primary sources of cash from normal operations are premiums  investment income and maturities of investments 
we have obtained  and may in the future obtain  cash through public and private offerings of our common stock  the exercise of stock options and warrants and other capital markets activities including the sale or exchange of debt instruments 
our primary uses of cash are policy acquisition costs principally commissions  claim payments to policyholders  investment purchases  deposits to our notional experience account  debt service and general and administrative expenses 
our cash increased  in due primarily to  in additional funds generated from the issuance of convertible subordinated debt

parent company operations we have engaged in financing activities  including issuance of debt securities  over the past two years to fund our liquidity and subsidiary capital needs 
these activities have included in the first quarter of  we completed the sale of convertible subordinated notes due the notes and received proceeds of  we used  of the proceeds to satisfy the premium to surplus requirements of our voluntary consent order with the florida insurance department 
we used the remaining proceeds to supplement parent liquidity  retire our remaining notes  and for general working capital purposes

substantially all of the amounts contained in this table with respect to such liabilities consist of estimates by the company s management based on various actuarial and other assumptions relating to morbidity  mortality and persistency 
in accordance with gaap  a substantial portion of such liabilities are carried on a discounted basis on the consolidated balance sheet  however  the amounts contained in this table are presented on an undiscounted basis 
the actual payments relating to these liabilities will differ  both in amount and timing  from indicated in the table

contractual payments owed to a vendor relating to the outsourcing arrangement for the daily operations of our information technology department 
the contract expires in the first quarter of cash flow needs of penn treaty primarily include interest payments on outstanding debt and operating expenses 
the funding is primarily derived from the operating cash flow of our agency subsidiary operations and dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
however  as noted above  the dividend capabilities of the insurance subsidiaries are limited and we may need to rely upon the dividend capabilities of our agency subsidiaries to meet current liquidity needs 
we believe that our current cash on hand and these sources of funds will be sufficient to service our debt obligations through at least april  and potentially through october   which is dependent upon our parent company expenses and liquidity  agency dividend capabilities or our subsidiary surplus needs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient funds through operations or raise additional capital to meet our debt service obligations during or if our assumptions about our ability to service our debt prior to are not correct  we may default on our debt obligations 
we will need to raise additional capital to satisfy any parent company liquidity needs  including debt service payments  beyond october  particularly if the price of our common stock on or after october  is insufficient to cause mandatory conversion of our notes 
our anticipated cash needs for are as follows debt interest payments  litigation settlements  parent expenses  cash requirements  our anticipated cash provided for is as follows cash and investments on hand  subsidiary sources  cash sources  subsidiary operations our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by various state insurance departments 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has risk based capital rbc requirements for insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks  such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that an insurer must maintain 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which may require specific corrective action depending upon the insurer s state of domicile 
our insurance subsidiaries  ptna  anic  and ainic representing approximately  and of our direct in force premium  respectively are required to hold statutory surplus that is above a certain required level 
at december   ptna had total adjusted capital at the regulatory action level  which required it to file a plan with the department 
anic is also subject to the plan because it is owned by ptna 
on february   the department approved the plan 
as a primary component of the plan  effective december   ptna and anic entered a reinsurance transaction to reinsure  on a quota share basis  substantially all of our long term care insurance policies then in force 
the agreement is subject to certain coverage limitations  including an aggregate limit of liability that is a function of certain factors and that may be reduced in the event that the rate increases that the reinsurance agreement may require are not obtained 
we are required to perform annual comparisons of our actual to expected claims experience 
if we have reason to believe  whether from this analysis or other available information  that at least a premium rate increase is necessary  we are obligated to file and obtain such premium rate increases in order to comply with the requirements of the agreement 
if we do not file and obtain such premium rate increases  our aggregate limit of liability would be reduced by of the premium amount that would have otherwise been received 
as part of this agreement  annual risk charges in excess of  are assessed against our experience account by the reinsurer 
the annual amount increases if we do not commute on december  this agreement meets the requirements to qualify for reinsurance treatment under statutory accounting rules 
however  this agreement does not qualify for reinsurance treatment in accordance with gaap because  the agreement does not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss 
this is due to a number of factors related to the agreement  including experience refund provisions  the expense and risk charges credited to the experience account by the reinsurer and the aggregate limit of liability 
the initial premium of the treaties was approximately  comprised of  of cash and qualified securities transferred in february  and  as funds held due to the reinsurer 
the initial premium and subsequent cash flows from the reinsured policies  less claims payments  ceding commissions and risk charges  is credited to a notional experience account  which is held for our benefit in the event of commutation and recapture on or after december  the notional experience account balance receives an investment credit based upon the total return from a series of benchmark indices and derivative hedges that are intended to match the duration of our reserve liability 
our current modeling and actuarial projections suggest that it is probable that we will be able to commute the agreement  as planned  on december  in order to commute the agreement  our statutory capital following commutation must be sufficient to support the reacquired business in compliance with all statutory requirements 
upon commutation  we would receive cash or other liquid assets equaling the market value of our experience account from the reinsurer 
we would also record the necessary reserves for the business in our statutory financial statements 
our ability to commute the agreement is highly dependent upon the market value of the notional experience account exceeding the level of required reserves to be established 
in addition to the performance of the reinsured policies from now until  the notional experience account value is susceptible to market interest rate changes 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the market value of the current notional experience account by approximately  and jeopardize our ability to commute as planned 
as we approach the intended commutation date  the sensitivity of our notional experience account to market interest rate movement will decline as the duration of the benchmark indices becomes shorter  however the amount of assets susceptible to such interest sensitivity will continue to grow as additional net cash flows are added to the notional experience account balance prior to commutation 
the reinsurer has agreed to fix the market value of the experience account and to invest the assets in a manner that we request in order to minimize short term volatility when we inform the reinsurer of our intention to commute the agreement 
the reinsurance agreement also granted the reinsurer an option to participate in reinsuring new business sales on a quota share basis 
in august  the reinsurer exercised its option to reinsure up to of future sales  subject to a limitation of the reinsurer s risk 
this agreement does not qualify for reinsurance treatment in accordance with gaap because  the agreement does not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss 
this is due to an aggregate limit of liability that reduces the likelihood of the reinsurer realizing a significant loss on the agreement 
however  this agreement meets the requirements to qualify for reinsurance treatment under statutory accounting rules 
in march  the reinsurer notified us of its decision to cease reinsuring newly issued policies on august l  policies reinsured prior to august  will be unaffected by the termination of this agreement 
the company s separate agreement with the reinsurer to reinsure existing policies issued prior to december  will be unaffected by the determination made by the reinsurer regarding newly issued policies 
upon the department s approval of the plan in february  we recommenced new policy sales in states  including pennsylvania 
we have now recommenced new policy sales in additional states  including florida and california subject to corrective orders 
florida  california and pennsylvania accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our direct premium revenue for the year ended december  we are actively working with the remaining states to recommence new policy sales in all jurisdictions 
the plan requires us to comply with certain agreements at the direction of the department  including  but not limited to o new investments are limited to naic or rated securities 
o affiliated transactions are limited and require department approval 
o an agreement to increase statutory reserves by an additional  throughout  which has been completed 
effective september   we determined to discontinue the sale nationally of all new long term care insurance policies until the plan was approved by the department 
the decision resulted from our concern about further depletion of statutory surplus from new sales prior to the completion and approval of the plan and from increasing concern regarding our status by many states in which we are licensed to conduct business 
the form of our cessation varied by state  ranging from no action to certificate suspensions 
the majority of our insurance subsidiaries cash flow results from our existing long term care policies  which have been ceded to the reinsurer under this agreement 
our subsidiaries ability to meet additional liquidity needs and cover fixed expenses in the future is highly dependent upon our ability to issue new policies and to control expense growth 
our future growth and new policy issuance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand our historical markets  retain and expand our network of agents and effectively market our products and our ability to fund our marketing and expansion while maintaining minimum statutory levels of capital and surplus required to support such growth 
under the insurance laws of pennsylvania and new york  where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  insurance companies can pay ordinary dividends only out of earned surplus 
in addition  under pennsylvania law  our pennsylvania insurance subsidiaries including our primary insurance subsidiary must give the department at least days advance notice of any proposed extraordinary dividend and cannot pay such a dividend if the department disapproves the payment during that day period 
for purposes of that provision  an extraordinary dividend is a dividend that  together with all other dividends paid during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s surplus as shown on the company s last annual statement filed with department or its statutory net income as shown on that annual statement 
statutory earnings are generally lower than earnings reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles due to the immediate or accelerated recognition of all costs associated with premium growth and benefit reserves 
additionally  the plan requires the department to approve all dividend requests made by ptna  regardless of normal statutory requirements for allowable dividends 
we believe that the department is unlikely to consider any dividend request in the foreseeable future  as a result of ptna s current statutory surplus position 
although not stipulated in the plan  this requirement is likely to continue until such time as penn treaty meets normal statutory allowances  including reported net income and positive cumulative earned surplus 
we do not expect that this will occur in the foreseeable future 
under new york law  our new york insurance subsidiary ainic must give the new york insurance department days advance notice of any proposed dividend and cannot pay any dividend if the regulator disapproves the payment during that day period 
in addition  our new york insurance company must obtain the prior approval of the new york insurance department before paying any dividend that  together with all other dividends paid during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the lesser of of the insurance company s surplus as of the preceding december or its adjusted net investment income for the year ended the preceding december ptna and anic have not paid any dividends to penn treaty for the past three years and are unlikely in the foreseeable future to be able to make dividend payments due to insufficient statutory surplus and anticipated earnings 
however  our new york subsidiary is not subject to the plan and was permitted by new york statute to make a dividend payment following december  consequently  in  penn treaty received a dividend from our new york subsidiary of at december   our subsidiaries had no debt outstanding

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in securities and other investments authorized by applicable state laws and regulations and follow an investment policy designed to maximize yield to the extent consistent with liquidity requirements and preservation of assets 
a significant portion of assets and liabilities are financial instruments  which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate risk on fixed rate domestic medium term instruments and  to a lesser extent  domestic short term and long term instruments 
we have established strategies  asset quality standards  asset allocations and other relevant criteria for our portfolio to manage our exposure to market risk 
our financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
our portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in single issuers other than us treasury and agency obligations  industry segments or geographic regions 
however  our notional experience account balance  which represents a substantial portion of our investable assets at december   is with one reinsurer 
although sufficient assets to support our statutory reserve liabilities are secured by trust accounts and irrevocable letters of credit with major united states financial institutions  the accumulated profits of our reinsured business are susceptible to significant credit risk of the reinsurer 
we urge caution in evaluating overall market risk from the information below 
actual results could differ materially because the information was developed using estimates and assumptions as described below  and because insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables are excluded in the hypothetical effects insurance liabilities represent of total liabilities and reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses and the notional experience account due from reinsurer represent of total assets 
long term debt  although not carried at fair value  is included in the hypothetical effect calculation 
the hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of our financial instruments including our notional experience account balance  as discussed below as of december   excluding insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses because such insurance related assets and liabilities are not carried at fair value  would have been as follows if interest rates had increased by basis points at december   there would have been a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value of our investment portfolio including our national experience account less our long term debt 
a basis point increase in market rates at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value 
if interest rates had decreased by and basis points  there would have been a net increase of approximately million and million  respectively  in the net fair value of our total investments and debt 
if interest rates had increased by basis points at december   there would have been a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value of our investment portfolio including our notional experience account less our long term debt 
a basis point increase in market rates at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value 
if interest rates had decreased by and basis points  there would have been a net increase of approximately million and million  respectively  in the net fair value of our total investments and debt 
effective december   we entered a reinsurance agreement to reinsure  on a quota share basis  substantially all of our long term care insurance policies in force 
the transaction resulted in the transfer of debt and equity securities of approximately million to the reinsurer 
the agreement provides us the opportunity to commute and recapture on or after december  to that end  the reinsurer will maintain a notional experience account for our benefit only in the event of commutation and recapture  which reflects the initial premium paid  future premiums collected net of claims  expenses and accumulated investment earnings 
the notional experience account balance will receive an investment credit based upon the total return of a series of benchmark indices and hedges that are designed to closely match the duration of reserve liabilities 
as a result  we will likely experience significant volatility in our future financial statements 
our ability to commute the agreement is highly dependent upon the market value of the notional experience account exceeding the level of required reserves to be established 
in addition to the performance of the reinsured policies from now until  the notional experience account value is susceptible to market interest rate changes 
a market interest rate increase of basis points could reduce the market value of the current notional experience account by approximately million and jeopardize our ability to commute as planned 
as we approach the intended commutation date  the sensitivity of our notional experience account to market interest rate movement will decline as the duration of the benchmark indices becomes shorter  however the amount of assets susceptible to such interest sensitivity will continue to grow as additional net cash flows are added to the notional experience account balance prior to commutation 
we intend to give notice to the reinsurer of our intention to commute on december  at such time as we are highly confident of our ability to support the reacquired policies 
the reinsurer has agreed to fix the market value of the notional experience account at that time  and to then invest the assets in a manner that we request in order to minimize short term volatility 
we hold certain mortgage and asset backed securities as part of our investment portfolio 
the fair value of these instruments may react in a convex or non linear fashion when subjected to interest rate increases or decreases 
the anticipated cash flows of these instruments may differ from expectations in changing interest rate environments  resulting in duration drift or a varying nature of predicted time weighted present values of cash flows 
the result of unpredicted cash flows from these investments could cause the above hypothetical estimates to change 
however  we believe that the minimal amount we have invested in these instruments and their broadly defined payment parameters sufficiently outweigh the cost of computer models necessary to accurately predict the possible impact on our investment income of hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of financial instruments as of december
