in management s discussion and analysis  we provide information about our general business risks  critical accounting policies and estimates  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  and certain other matters affecting our operating results for the periods covered by this report 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of operations  which present the results of our operations for   and  and are summarized on the following pages 
we analyze and explain the differences between periods for the components of net income loss in the following sections 
our analysis is important in making decisions about your investment in sitel corporation 
we previously announced a profit improvement plan to structure the company to achieve at least a to operating margin by the end of this profit improvement plan was comprised of a set of initiatives 
we are planning to rationalize underutilized facilities  eliminate losses from business units that are underperforming  right size support functions to better utilize human and physical assets  reduce and further leverage it and telecommunication costs  and improve the operating performance of all of our facilities through enhanced efficiency 
we will continue to focus on our performance based pricing initiatives  invoice and contract management  and statement of work change controls 
although the first half of showed operating margins of close to as many business units in north america and europe improved  the previously announced loss of an account and the reduced pricing under a large contract temporarily slowed our improving trend 
on december   we committed to a restructuring plan to reduce ongoing operating expenses  consolidate facilities  and reduce our workforce 
the plan included closing certain facilities in north america and europe and reducing headcount by a total of approximately employees throughout the company 
the plan also included disposing of certain capital equipment 
we completed a majority of the restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of and expect to complete the remainder during general business risks  critical accounting policies and estimates general business risks our business success depends on our ability to efficiently deploy our human and capital resources in the delivery of services to our clients 
consequently  the needs of our clients may significantly impact our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
our results of operations and operating cash flows may vary with periodic wins and losses of client contracts and with changes in the scope of client requirements 
our top clients accounted for   and of our revenue in   and some of these top clients include multiple independently managed business units within the clients affiliated group 
general motors corporation general motors business units were responsible for   and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on april   we announced the signing of a new contract with general motors to continue to provide customer support services for their north american vehicle sales  service  and marketing group through december  an existing agreement under which we supported onstar operations terminated effective june  in addition  hewlett packard company business units were responsible for of our revenue in we did not have any other clients under common control that generated more than of our total revenue in  and the financial failure of any of these clients or the loss of any or all of their business could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our liquidity  including our ability to comply with debt covenants  may be adversely affected if we were to lose a significant client or as a result of significant changes in client demand if we are unable to efficiently re deploy our human and capital resources 
we have operations in many parts of the world and therefore our financial statements can be impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations 
fluctuations of currencies against the us dollar can be substantial and therefore significantly impact comparisons with prior periods 
in the following sections  we also discuss the importance of our critical accounting policies and the use of accounting estimates  and their potential impacts on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies and practices are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
of those policies  we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies because they are the most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition  and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with applicable accounting standards  including securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time services are performed based on the rate detailed in the client contract  such as hourly  monthly  per call or per employee 
a portion of our revenue is often subject to performance standards  such as sales per hour  average handle time  occupancy rate and abandonment rate 
our performance against such standards may result in incentives or penalties  which are recognized as earned or incurred 
in certain circumstances  we receive payment in advance of providing service 
accordingly  amounts billed but not earned under these contracts are excluded from revenue and included in deferred revenue and other in the consolidated balance sheet 
revenue for services performed under certain collection service agreements is recognized as the related consumer debts are collected and is calculated based upon a percentage of cash collected or other agreed upon contractual parameters 
trade accounts receivable we report our trade accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  which represents management s estimates of the amount of our receivables that may not be collectible  net of recoveries of amounts previously written off 
these estimates are based on a detailed aging analysis of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  and changes in our client payment terms 
the financial condition of our clients may deteriorate  which may require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we would record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as operating  selling  and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations  which would reduce our results of operations 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost  and calculate depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which generally range from to years 
we amortize leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
if the actual useful lives of these assets are less than the estimated depreciable lives  we would record additional depreciation expense or losses on disposal to the extent the net book value of such asset is not recovered upon sale 
asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
triggering events include a significant change in the extent or manner in which long lived assets are being used or in its physical condition  in legal factors  or in the business climate that could affect the value of the long lived assets 
the interpretation of such events requires judgment from management as to whether such an event has occurred 
upon the occurrence of a triggering event  the carrying amount of a long lived asset is reviewed to assess whether the recoverable amount has declined below its carrying amount 
the recoverable amount is the estimated net future cash flows that we expect to recover from the future use of the asset  undiscounted and without interest  plus the asset s residual value on disposal 
where the recoverable amount of the long lived asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized to write down the asset to its fair value  which is based on discounted estimated cash flows from the future use of the asset 
the estimated cash flows arising from future use of the asset that are used in the impairment analysis requires judgment regarding what we would expect to recover from future use of the asset 
any changes in the estimates of cash flows arising from future use of the asset or the residual value of the asset on disposal based on changes in the market conditions  changes in the use of the assets  management s plans  and the determination of the useful life of the assets could significantly change the recoverable amount of the asset or the calculation of the fair value and the resulting impairment loss  which could significantly affect the results of operations 
goodwill at least annually  or more frequently as changes in circumstances indicate  we will evaluate the estimated fair value of our goodwill 
on these evaluation dates  to the extent that the carrying value of the net assets of any of our reporting units having goodwill is greater than their estimated fair value  we will be required to take additional goodwill impairment charges 
we are required to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the fair value of goodwill when assessing for impairment 
changes in the fact patterns underlying such assumptions and estimates could ultimately result in the recognition of additional impairment losses 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of and determined that a goodwill impairment charge of million was required for one of our reporting units 
the impairment charge is included in asset impairment and restructuring expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in calculating the goodwill impairment charge  the fair value of the reporting unit was determined with the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist using a discounted cash flow valuation approach 
no impairment charges resulted from the annual impairment tests for the years ended december  and deferred income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
if enacted tax rates change  we would adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities  through the provision for income taxes in the period of change  to reflect the enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when the deferred tax items reverse 
to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets can be recovered 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including our current and past performance  the market environment in which we operate  the utilization of past tax credits  length of carryback and carryforward periods  and existing or prospective contracts that will result in future profits 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years in certain tax jurisdictions 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
we have established valuation allowances for future tax benefits related to net operating losses incurred in certain federal  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
we expect to continue to record a valuation allowance on future tax benefits in certain tax jurisdictions until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained 
self insurance reserves we are self insured in north america for workers compensation and health care claims for eligible participating employees  subject to certain deductibles and limitations 
the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience  and current cost trends 
actual claims results could differ from these estimates 
contingencies we consider the likelihood of various loss contingencies  including tax and legal contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business  and our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
results of operations in this section  we discuss our operating results and the factors affecting them 
we describe our general business risks  critical accounting policies  and estimates that are important to our operating results on the previous pages

compared to revenue revenue increased million  or  in compared to the changes in revenue by geographic region are shown in the following table change change in millions north america europe asia pacific latin america totals the increase in north america revenue in compared to was due primarily to a million increase in customer care and technical support services we provided to a number of our clients  partially offset by a million decrease in customer acquisition and risk management business 
the weakening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar accounted for million of the increase 
european revenue increased million in compared to the same period in higher sales volumes from new and existing clients resulted in million of the increase year over year 
the weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound and the euro accounted for the remaining million of the increase 
asia pacific revenue increased million in compared to higher sales volumes from new and existing clients resulted in million of the increase in compared to the weakening of the us dollar versus the new zealand and australian dollars resulted in the remaining million of the increase 
latin america revenue increased million in compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to the change in how we report our investment in our panama affiliate 
effective october   we completed the previously announced restructuring in the governance of our latin america joint venture that handles services in panama and other latin america countries and offshore services in mexico and central america 
as a result of this revision in governance  we reported our investment in our panama affiliate using the consolidation method rather than the equity method of accounting effective october  as a result of this change  our latin america revenue includes the revenue associated with our panama affiliate 
consolidation of our panama affiliate s revenue resulted in million of the increase in compared to higher sales volumes resulted in million of the increase 
the remaining million of the increase in revenue is a result of the weakening of the us dollar versus the brazilian real 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses direct labor and telecommunications expenses include the compensation of our customer service professionals and their first line supervisors and telephone usage expenses directly related to the production of revenue 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenue can vary based on the nature of the contract  the nature of the work  and the market in which the services are provided 
accordingly  direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenue can vary  sometimes significantly  from year to year 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to in compared to in the increase was primarily the result of higher direct labor costs  particularly in europe  and the reduced pricing on a major client contract 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of the recording of a benefit from a refund of million of payroll tax overpayments paid in a prior year as a reduction of direct labor and telecommunications expense 
subcontracted and other services expenses subcontracted and other services expenses include services provided to clients through subcontractors and other out of pocket expenses passed through to our clients 
subcontracted and other services expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily the result of lower subcontracted it costs to support client programs 
subcontract expenses for services provided by our india joint venture for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
operating  selling and administrative expenses operating  selling and administrative expenses represent expenses incurred to directly support and manage the business  including costs of management  administration  technology  facilities  depreciation and amortization  maintenance  sales and marketing  and client support services 
operating  selling and administrative expenses increased million  or in compared to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the primary jurisdictions that we operate in accounted for an increase of million 
as a result of the change in accounting for our panama affiliate as previously discussed  operating  selling and administrative expenses increased million in compared to the remainder of the increase in these expenses was associated with our revenue increase 
as a percentage of revenue  operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased to in compared to in the decrease is primarily the result of higher sales volumes while maintaining the existing cost structure 
asset impairment and restructuring expenses during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of asset impairment and restructuring expenses 
in connection with the cost reduction portion of the company s profit improvement plan  we recorded asset impairment and restructuring expenses of million 
this amount is comprised of million of severance costs  million of asset impairment costs and million of scheduled payments of operating leases for which we will receive no future economic benefit 
in addition  we recorded asset impairment and restructuring expenses of million as a result of a revision to our estimate for non cancelable lease payments associated with previously announced facility closures 
we also recorded asset impairment and restructuring expenses of million related to the impairment of goodwill related to one of our reporting units that has been performing below expectations 
the following table summarizes these charges in description in millions cash charges employee severance facilities leases total cash charges non cash charges goodwill impairment fixed asset disposals total non cash charges total during  in connection with the closure of our former headquarters facility and the closure of a contact center  we recorded asset impairment and restructuring expenses of million  which consisted of the write off of abandoned leasehold improvements of million and for million of scheduled payments of operating leases for which we will receive no future economic benefit 
in addition  we recorded asset impairment and restructuring expenses of million as a result of a revision to our estimate for non cancelable lease payments associated with a previously announced facility closure 
operating income operating income decreased million in compared to due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense interest expense increased million in compared to this is partially a result of the million premium paid and the write off of deferred financing costs related to the redemption of million in senior subordinated notes 
the remaining increase is due to higher average borrowings on the revolving credit facility for compared to the same period in interest income interest income remained consistent in compared to equity in earnings of affiliates the decrease in equity in earnings of affiliates in compared to primarily relates to reduced earnings from our india joint venture due to changes in client mix and higher ramp up costs 
other expense  net other expense increased million in compared to the increase was primarily the result of foreign currency remeasurement losses arising from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
income tax expense the effective tax rate for was more than the us statutory rate of partially due to not reflecting any significant tax benefits for the current net operating losses in certain federal  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that we will not realize the full benefit of deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions 
consequently  we recorded an increase to the existing valuation allowance resulting in non cash tax expense of approximately million 
this increase in the income tax expense was partially offset by the reversal of million of valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets in certain of our foreign jurisdictions reflecting foreign net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are expected to be utilized 
the effective tax rate for was significantly more than the us statutory rate of  which was primarily the result of not reflecting any significant tax benefits for the current net operating losses in certain federal  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
compared to revenue revenue increased million  or  in compared to the changes in revenue by geographic region are shown in the following table change change in millions north america europe asia pacific latin america totals the decrease in north america revenue in compared to was due primarily to a million decline in customer care and customer acquisition services we provided to a number of our clients partially offset by a million increase in revenue by our technical support services and risk management business 
the primary reason for the decrease in revenue is due to pricing pressure resulting from excess capacity in north america  created primarily by the movement of business offshore 
the transfer of certain business to lower cost labor markets offshore results in lower revenue for the same volume of business 
european revenue increased million in compared to the same period in higher sales volumes from new and existing clients and the implementation of multiple pan european client accounts that commenced in early resulted in an increase in revenue of million in compared to the weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound and euro accounted for the remaining million of the increase 
asia pacific revenue increased million in compared to revenue increased million due to the impact of changes in foreign currency  which was offset by a decrease of million as a result of lower volumes

direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenue can vary based on the nature of the contract  the nature of the work  and the market in which the services are provided 
accordingly  direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenue can vary  sometimes significantly  from year to year

based upon our review of our investee s financial condition  results of operations and operating trends and the implied value from recent rounds of financing completed by the investee  we determined that an other than temporary impairment existed for two of our investments 
income tax expense the effective tax rate for was significantly more than the us statutory rate which was primarily the result of not reflecting any significant tax benefits for the current net operating losses in certain federal  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
in  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes  minority interest and change in accounting method  was 
the majority of the difference between this rate and the statutory us federal rate of was due to a million increase in our deferred tax valuation allowance 
the remaining difference was due to net operating losses in certain european and asia pacific subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized and us state and local income taxes offset by lower international tax rates in certain jurisdictions 
financial condition and liquidity in this section  we discuss our financial condition and liquidity and the factors affecting them 
we separately discuss cash flows  capital resources  and contractual obligations and commitments 
we describe our general business risks  critical accounting policies  and estimates that are important to our financial condition and liquidity earlier in this report 
please refer to that discussion as you read this section 
cash flows the following table sets forth summary cash flow data for the periods indicated 
please refer to this summary as you read our discussion of the sources and uses of cash in each year 
years ended december  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities in  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from income before asset impairment and restructuring expenses  depreciation and amortization  and other charges of million  a million decrease in other assets  a million increase in trade accounts payable  and a million increase in other liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in trade accounts receivable

in  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from income before asset impairment and restructuring expenses  depreciation and amortization  and other charges of million and a million increase in other liabilities  which were partially offset by a million increase in trade accounts receivable and million decrease in trade accounts payable 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment and used million to increase investments in affiliates 
this was partially offset by million of proceeds from dividends received from an equity method investee 
in  we received cash from financing activities mostly from million of net borrowings under our credit facility and million of net borrowings under other local lines of credit 
in  we used cash for financing activities to repay million of capital lease obligations 
in addition  we used cash to purchase a total of million of common stock under our existing stock purchase program 
in  cash provided by operating activities came from income before asset impairment and restructuring expenses  depreciation and amortization  and other charges of million and a million decrease in trade accounts payable  which were partially offset by a million increase in trade accounts receivable and other assets and a million decrease in other liabilities 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment 
we received million from the sale of property and equipment associated with our joint ventures 
in  we received cash from financing activities mostly from borrowings under our credit facility 
capital resources we have historically used funds generated from operations  leases of property and equipment  senior subordinated notes  and borrowings under credit facilities with banks to finance business acquisitions  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
we have a three year million revolving credit facility  which expires in december the credit facility is secured by accounts receivable in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
we intend to utilize the facility  as needed  for ongoing working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
at december   we had million of available borrowings under the credit facility  and we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the facility 
we are currently in the process of refinancing the revolving credit facility and our subordinated notes 
we expect to finance our current operations  planned capital expenditures  and internal growth for the foreseeable future using funds generated from operations  existing cash and available funds under our credit facility in addition to lease financing for property and equipment 
we estimate that our capital expenditures will range from million to million to cover technology upgrades  asset replacement and new business initiatives 
future acquisitions  if any  may require additional debt or equity financing 
under a stock repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in february  we may repurchase up to million of our shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on general business and market conditions 
through the date of this report  we had repurchased a total of  shares at a total cost of million 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations and commitments that are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december  total less than year years years over years in thousands long term debt capital leases operating leases other debt total off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement and that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
other matters quarterly results and seasonality we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our results of operations mostly due to the timing of our clients customer management initiatives and customer acquisition and loyalty campaigns  the commencement of new contracts and the discontinuance and termination of existing contracts  revenue mix  the timing of additional operating  selling  and administrative expenses to support new business  and the timing of recognition of incentive fees 
we experience periodic fluctuations in our results of operations related to both the start up costs associated with expansion and the implementation of clients customer management activities 
in addition  our business generally tends to be slower in the third quarter due to summer holidays in europe 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material effect on our operations in the future 
related party transactions we have made minority interest investments for business and strategic purposes through the purchase of voting common and preferred stock of companies 
these investments are included in investments in affiliates in consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  the investment in our india joint venture was approximately million and million respectively 
subcontracted services provided by our india joint venture for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively and are included in subcontracted and other services expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company had payables to our india joint venture of million and million at december  and  respectively  which are included in trade accounts payable in the consolidated financial statements 
we received million of dividend distributions from our india joint venture during the year ended december  as of december  and  the investment in certain latin america affiliates was approximately million and million  respectively 
of the million investment in certain latin america affiliates  approximately million is equity method goodwill 
this equity method goodwill is not amortized 
subcontracted services provided by our latin america joint ventures for the years ended december    and were not material 
we received million of dividend distributions from our latin america affiliates during the year ended december  accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r 
this standard will require the cost of employee compensation paid with equity instruments to be measured based on grant date fair values with the cost recorded as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award generally over the vesting period of the award 
sfas r is effective july  the proforma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see stock based compensation in note to the consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for the three years ended december   as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income loss and net income loss per share 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us in december  the fasb issued fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp provides additional time to companies beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the ajca on their plans for repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas  accounting for income taxes 
the company is currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of ajca  which if implemented would affect our tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
due to the complexity and uncertainty of applying the provisions of the act  the income tax effects of such repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
in january  the fasb released interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 fin  which required that all primary beneficiaries of variable interest entities vie consolidate that entity 
fin was effective immediately for vie s created after january  and to vie s in which an enterprise obtained an interest after that date 
it applied in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to vie s in which an enterprise held a variable interest it acquired before february  in december  the fasb published a revision to fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of the interpretation and to defer the effective date of implementation for certain entities 
the remaining provisions of fin r were effective january  the adoption of fin r had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to market risks associated primarily with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have operations in many parts of the world  however  both revenue and expenses of those operations are typically denominated in the currency of the country of operations  providing a natural hedge 
our financial statements are presented in us dollars and can be impacted by foreign currency exchange fluctuations through both i translation risk  which is the risk that the financial statements for a particular period or as of a certain date depend on the prevailing exchange rates of the various currencies against the us dollar  and ii transaction risk  which is the risk that the currency impact of transactions denominated in currencies other than the business unit s functional currency may vary according to currency fluctuations 
with respect to translation risk  even though the fluctuations of currencies against the us dollar can be substantial and therefore significantly impact comparisons with prior periods  the translation impact is included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  and does not affect the underlying results of operations 
gains and losses related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the countries in which we operate including short term intercompany accounts are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
interest rate risk we are also exposed to changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings 
interest rates on our senior subordinated notes and capital lease obligations are fixed  but rates on borrowings under our bank credit facility are variable 
during the years ended december   and  our average borrowings under our bank credit facility were million  million  and million  respectively 
based on our projected cash needs for the foreseeable future  we do not expect that our exposure to changes in interest rates for these borrowings will have a material impact on our interest expense 
investment risk we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments 
our financial instruments included cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  current and long term debt 
our cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and current debt balances are short term in nature and do not expose us to material investment risk 
our long term debt  which had a book value of million and million at december  and  respectively  had a fair value of million and million  respectively
