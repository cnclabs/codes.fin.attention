item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the largest rent to own operator in the united states with an approximate market share based on store count 
at december   we operated  company owned stores nationwide and in canada and puerto rico  including stores in wisconsin operated by our subsidiary get it now  llc under the name get it now and five stores located in canada operated by our subsidiary rent a centre  ltd  under the name rent a centre 
another of our subsidiaries  colortyme  is a national franchisor of rent to own stores 
at december   colortyme had franchised stores in states  of which operated under the colortyme name and stores of which operated under the rent a center name 
our stores generally offer high quality durable products such as major consumer electronics  appliances  computers  and furniture and accessories under flexible rental purchase agreements that generally allow the customer to obtain ownership of the merchandise at the conclusion of an agreed upon rental period 
these rental purchase agreements are designed to appeal to a wide variety of customers by allowing them to obtain merchandise that they might otherwise be unable to obtain due to insufficient cash resources or a lack of access to credit 
these agreements also cater to customers who only have a temporary need  or who simply desire to rent rather than purchase the merchandise 
rental payments are made generally on a weekly basis and  together with applicable fees  constitute our primary revenue source 
our expenses primarily relate to merchandise costs and the operations of our stores  including salaries and benefits for our employees  occupancy expense for our leased real estate  advertising expenses  lost  damaged  or stolen merchandise  fixed asset depreciation  and corporate and other expenses 
we have pursued an aggressive growth strategy since we have sought to acquire underperforming rent to own stores to which we could apply our operating model as well as open new stores 
as a result  the acquired stores have generally experienced more significant revenue growth during the initial periods following their acquisition than in subsequent periods 
because of significant growth since our formation  our historical results of operations and period to period comparisons of such results and other financial data  including the rate of earnings growth  may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
we plan to continue growing through selective and opportunistic acquisitions of existing rent to own stores  and development of new rent to own stores  as well as offering new products and services designed to appeal to our customer demographic 
typically  a newly opened rent to own store is profitable on a monthly basis in the ninth to twelfth month after its initial opening 
historically  a typical store has achieved cumulative break even profitability in to months after its initial opening 
total financing requirements of a typical new store approximate  with roughly of that amount relating to the purchase of rental merchandise inventory 
a newly opened store historically has achieved results consistent with other stores that have been operating within the system for greater than two years by the end of its third year of operation 
as a result  our quarterly earnings are impacted by how many new stores we opened during a particular quarter and the quarters preceding it 
in addition  we strategically open or acquire stores near market areas served by existing stores cannibalize to enhance service levels  gain incremental sales and increase market penetration 
this planned cannibalization may negatively impact our same store revenue and cause us to grow at a slower rate 
there can be no assurance that we will open any new rent to own stores in the future  or as to the number  location or profitability thereof 
the following discussion focuses on our results of operations  and issues related to our liquidity and capital resources 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements the statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this report are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  
table of contents such as may  will  would  expect  intend  could  estimate  should  anticipate or believe 
we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are accurate 
however  we cannot assure you that such expectations will occur 
our actual future performance could differ materially from such statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to uncertainties regarding our ability to open new rent to own stores  our ability to acquire additional rent to own stores on favorable terms  our ability to enhance the performance of these acquired stores  our ability to control store level costs  our ability to realize benefits from our margin enhancement initiatives  our ability to identify and successfully market products and services that appeal to our customer demographic  the results of our litigation  the passage of legislation adversely affecting the rent to own industry  interest rates  our ability to collect on our rental purchase agreements  our ability to enter into new rental purchase agreements  economic pressures affecting the disposable income available to our targeted consumers  such as high fuel and utility costs  changes in our effective tax rate  our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls  changes in our stock price and the number of shares of common stock that we may or may not repurchase  and the other risks detailed from time to time in our sec reports 
additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations are discussed under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
you should not unduly rely on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
except as required by law  we are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies involving critical estimates  uncertainties or assessments in our financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying accounting principles  we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
self insurance liabilities 
we have self insured retentions with respect to losses under our workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability insurance policies 
we establish reserves for our liabilities 
table of contents associated with these losses by obtaining forecasts for the ultimate expected losses and estimating amounts needed to pay losses within our self insured retentions 
we make assumptions on our liabilities within our self insured retentions using actuarial loss forecasts  which are prepared using methods and assumptions in accordance with standard actuarial practice  and third party claim administrator loss estimates which are based on known facts surrounding individual claims 
each quarter we reevaluate our estimate of liability within our self insured retentions  including our assumptions related to our loss forecasts and estimates  using actuarial loss forecasts updated during the quarter and currently valued third party claim administrator loss estimates 
we evaluate the adequacy of our accruals by comparing amounts accrued on our balance sheet for anticipated losses to our updated actuarial loss forecasts and third party claim administrator loss estimates  and make adjustments to our accruals as needed based upon such review 
over the previous years  our loss exposure has increased  primarily as a result of our growth 
we instituted procedures to manage our loss exposure through a greater focus on the risk management function  a transitional duty program for injured workers  ongoing safety and accident prevention training  and various programs designed to minimize losses and improve our loss experience in our store locations 
as of the year ended december   the net amount accrued for losses within our self insured retentions was million  as compared to million at december  the increase in the net amount accrued for the period is a result of store growth  increased number of employees  estimated costs associated with new claims made during the period  and the net effect of prior period claims which have closed or for which additional development or changes in estimates have occurred 
litigation reserves 
we are the subject of litigation in the ordinary course of our business 
our litigation involves  among other things  actions relating to claims that our rental purchase agreements constitute installment sales contracts  violate state usury laws or violate other state laws to protect consumers  claims asserting violations of wage and hour laws in our employment practices  as well as claims we violated the federal securities laws 
in preparing our financial statements at a given point in time  we account for these contingencies pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 which requires that we accrue for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable 
each quarter  we make estimates of our probable liabilities  if reasonably estimable  and record such amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
these amounts represent our best estimate  or may be the minimum range of probable loss when no single best estimate is determinable 
we  together with our counsel  monitor developments related to these legal matters and  when appropriate  adjustments are made to reflect current facts and circumstances 
as of december   we had accrued million in connection with the prospective settlement of the griego carrillo matter  and an additional million for probable litigation costs with respect to our outstanding litigation other than the griego carrillo matter as compared to million for the year ended december  the amounts accrued  relating to the prospective settlement in the griego carrillo matter and legal fees and expenses with respect to our remaining outstanding litigation other than griego carrillo  represent our estimate of the probable liabilities with respect to such litigation 
the ultimate outcome of our litigation is uncertain  and the amount of loss we may incur  if any  cannot in our judgment be reasonably estimated 
additional developments in our litigation  such as the failure to agree to a definitive settlement agreement and obtain court approval in the griego carrillo matter  or other adverse or positive developments or rulings in our litigation  could affect our assumptions and thus  our accrual 
if we make changes to our accruals in any of these areas in accordance with the policies described above  these changes would impact our earnings 
increases to our accruals would reduce earnings and similarly  reductions to our accruals would increase our earnings 
a pre tax change of million in our estimates would result in a corresponding change in our earnings per share 
based on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of our company as of  and 
table of contents for  the periods presented in this report 
however  we do not suggest that other general risk factors  such as those discussed elsewhere in this report as well as changes in our growth objectives or performance of new or acquired stores  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized below and in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
revenue 
merchandise is rented to customers pursuant to rental purchase agreements which provide for weekly  semi monthly or monthly rental terms with non refundable rental payments 
generally  the customer has the right to acquire title either through a purchase option or through payment of all required rentals 
rental revenue and fees are recognized over the rental term as payments are received and merchandise sales revenue is recognized when the customer exercises their purchase option and pays the cash price due 
revenue for the total amount of the rental purchase agreement is not accrued because the customer can cancel the rental contract at any time and we cannot enforce collection for non payment of rents 
because get it now makes retail sales on an installment credit basis  get it now s revenue is recognized at the time of such retail sale  as is the cost of the merchandise sold  net of a provision for uncollectible accounts 
franchise revenue 
revenue from the sale of rental merchandise is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise to the franchisee

depreciation of rental merchandise 
depreciation of rental merchandise is included in the cost of rentals and fees on our statement of earnings 
we depreciate our rental merchandise using the income forecasting method 
the income forecasting method of depreciation we use does not consider salvage value and does not allow the depreciation of rental merchandise during periods when it is not generating rental revenue 
the objective of this method of depreciation is to provide for consistent depreciation expense while the merchandise is on rent 
we accelerate the depreciation on computers that are months old or older and which have become idle using the straight line method for a period of at least six months  generally not to exceed an aggregate depreciation period of months 
the purpose is to better reflect the depreciable life of a computer in our stores and to encourage the sale of older computers 
cost of merchandise sold 
cost of merchandise sold represents the book value net of accumulated depreciation of rental merchandise at time of sale 
salaries and other expenses 
salaries and other expenses include all salaries and wages paid to store level employees  together with market managers salaries  travel and occupancy  including any related benefits and taxes  as well as all store level general and administrative expenses and selling  advertising  insurance  occupancy  delivery  fixed asset depreciation and other operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses

table of contents liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   we generated approximately million in operating cash flow 
in addition to funding operating expenses  we used approximately million for capital expenditures  over million in acquisitions of existing rent to own stores  and approximately million in stock repurchases 
we ended the year with approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease is attributable to a decrease in net earnings and changes in deferred income taxes and finance charges from recapitalization  as well as an increase in rental merchandise purchases  all of which were partially offset by the non cash effects of an increase in depreciation of rental merchandise and property assets and the net change of our accrued liabilities 
the increases in rental merchandise purchases and depreciation are attributable to our increasing store base 
the change in our accrued liabilities is primarily due to the litigation settlement accrual of million recorded in the third quarter of and an increase of million in our insurance accrual in as compared to cash used in investing activities increased by million to million in from million in this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of rent rite and rainbow rentals in may coupled with an increase in property assets purchased during the period  offset slightly by proceeds received from the sale of company assets 
cash used in financing activities increased by million to million in from million in this increase is primarily related to the effects of the recapitalization in as compared to our refinancing in  offset by a decrease in stock repurchases in liquidity requirements 
our primary liquidity requirements are for debt service  rental merchandise purchases  capital expenditures  and our growth strategy 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  borrowings and sales of debt and equity securities 
in the future  we may incur additional debt  or may issue debt or equity securities to finance our operating and growth strategies 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which relate to our financial condition and performance  and some of which are beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  or if available  that it will be on terms we find acceptable 
we believe that the cash flow generated from operations  together with amounts available under our senior credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  rental merchandise purchases  capital expenditures  and our growth strategy during our revolving credit facilities  including our million line of credit at intrust bank  provide us with revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding million  of which million was available at march  at march   we had million in cash 
while our operating cash flow has been strong and we expect this strength to continue  our liquidity could be negatively impacted if we do not remain as profitable as we expect 
in addition  to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued pursuit of our operating and growth strategies  we may incur from time to time additional short or long term bank indebtedness and may issue  in public or private transactions  equity and debt securities 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance  and some of which are beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
if a change in control occurs  we may be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding subordinated notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase 
our senior credit facility restricts our ability to repurchase the subordinated notes  including in the event of a change in control 
in addition  a change in control would result in an event of default under our senior credit facilities  which would allow our lenders to accelerate the indebtedness owed to them 
in the event a change in control occurs  we cannot be sure we would have enough funds to immediately pay our accelerated senior 
table of contents credit facility obligations and all of the subordinated notes  or that we would be able to obtain financing to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
litigation 
on october   we announced that we had reached a prospective settlement with the plaintiffs to resolve the benjamin griego  et al 
v 
rent a center  inc  et al arthur carrillo  et al 
v 
rent a center  inc  et al coordinated matters pending in state court in san diego  california 
these matters challenge certain of our business practices in california 
under the terms of the settlement  which has now been documented and preliminarily approved by the court  we anticipate we will pay an aggregate of million in cash  to be distributed to an agreed upon class of our customers from february through october  as well as the plaintiffs attorneys fees up to million and costs to administer the settlement in amounts to be determined 
in addition  we anticipate issuing vouchers to qualified class members for two weeks free rent on a new rental agreement for merchandise of their choice 
under the terms of the settlement  we are entitled to any undistributed monies up to an aggregate of million  with any additional undistributed funds distributed to non profit organizations to be determined 
in connection with the settlement  we are not admitting liability for our past business practices in california 
to account for the aforementioned costs  as well as our own attorneys fees  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the third quarter of we expect to fund the entire settlement amount in the second quarter of  following final approval of the settlement by the court 
while we believe that the terms of this settlement are fair  there can be no assurance that the settlement  if completed  will be approved by the court in its present form 
we believe that the cash flow generated from operations  together with amounts available under our senior credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund the prospective settlement without adversely affecting our liquidity or the ability to fund our operations as described above in a material way 
additional settlements or judgments against us on our existing litigation could affect our liquidity 
please refer to note l of our consolidated financial statements included herein 
deferred taxes 
on march   president bush signed into law the job creation and worker assistance act of  which provides for accelerated tax depreciation deductions for qualifying assets placed in service between september  and september  under these provisions  percent of the basis of qualifying property is deductible in the year the property is placed in service  with the remaining percent of the basis depreciated under the normal tax depreciation rules 
for assets placed in service between may  and december   the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of increased the percent of the basis of qualifying property deductible in the year the property is placed in service from to 
accordingly  our cash flow benefited from having a lower current cash tax obligation  which in turn provided additional cash flows from operations 
we estimate that our operating cash flow increased by approximately million through from the accelerated tax depreciation deductions and the associated deferred tax liabilities will begin to reverse over a three year period beginning in  of which approximately will reverse in  will reverse in and the remainder will reverse in rental merchandise purchases 
we purchased million  million and million of rental merchandise during the years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures 
we make capital expenditures in order to maintain our existing operations as well as for new capital assets in new and acquired stores 
we spent million  million and million on capital expenditures in the years  and  respectively  and expect to spend approximately million in acquisitions and new store openings 
during  we continued our strategy of increasing our rent to own store base through opening new stores  as well as through opportunistic acquisitions 
we spent approximately million in cash acquiring stores and accounts for the year ended december  it is our intention to increase the number of stores we operate by an average of approximately to per year over the next several years 
on may   we completed the acquisition of rent rite for an aggregate purchase price of million 
rent rite operated stores in states  of which we merged stores with our existing store 
table of contents locations 
approximately of the consideration was paid with our common stock  with the remaining portion consisting of cash  the assumption of rent rite s stock options and retirement of rent rite s outstanding debt 
on may   we completed the acquisition of rainbow rentals for an aggregate purchase price of million 
rainbow rentals operated stores in states  of which we merged stores with our existing store locations 
we funded the acquisition entirely with cash on hand 
we entered into these transactions seeing them as opportunistic acquisitions that would allow us to expand our store base in conjunction with our strategic growth plans 
the prices of the acquisitions were determined by evaluating the average monthly rental income of the acquired stores and applying a multiple to the total 
furthermore  during  we acquired additional stores  accounts from additional locations  opened new stores  and closed stores 
of the closed stores  were merged with existing store locations  and stores were sold 
the additional stores and acquired accounts were the result of separate transactions for an aggregate price of approximately million in cash 
the table below summarizes the store growth activity for the year ended december   and stores at beginning of period new store openings acquired stores remaining open closed stores merged with existing stores sold stores at end of period acquired stores closed and accounts merged with existing stores total approximate purchase price of acquisitions million million million the total purchase price includes non cash consideration of approximately million in common stock issued and approximately million in fair value assigned to the stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition of rent rite  inc the profitability of our rent to own stores tends to grow at a slower rate approximately five years from the time we open or acquire them 
as a result  in order for us to show improvements in our profitability  it is important for us to continue to open stores in new locations or acquire underperforming stores on favorable terms 
there can be no assurance we will be able to acquire or open new stores at the rates we expect  or at all 
we cannot assure you the stores we do acquire or open will be profitable at the same levels as our current stores  or at all 
senior credit facilities 
on july   we announced the completion of the refinancing of our senior secured debt 
our new million senior credit facilities consist of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
on that day  we drew down the million term loan and million of the revolving facility and utilized the proceeds to repay our old senior term debt 
in connection with the refinancing  we recorded a million non cash charge to write off the remaining unamortized balance of financing costs in the third quarter of the full amount of the revolving credit facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit  of which million had been utilized as of march  during the first quarter of  we repaid all amounts drawn under our revolving facility and as of march   million was available under our revolving facility 
the revolving credit facility expires in july and the term loan expires in

economic conditions 
although our performance has not suffered in previous economic downturns  we cannot assure you that demand for our products  particularly in higher price ranges  will not significantly decrease in the event of a prolonged recession 
temporary fluctuations in our targeted customers monthly disposable income  such as those we believe may have been caused by the recent nationwide increases in fuel and energy costs  could adversely impact our results of operations 
seasonality 
our revenue mix is moderately seasonal  with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year  primarily related to the exercise of early purchase options due to our customers receiving federal income tax refunds 
generally  our customers 
table of contents will more frequently exercise their early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year 
we expect this trend to continue in future periods 
furthermore  we tend to experience slower growth in the number of rental purchase agreements on rent in the third quarter of each fiscal year when compared to other quarters throughout the year 
as a result  we would expect revenues for the third quarter of each fiscal year to remain relatively flat with the prior quarter 
we expect this trend to continue in future periods unless we add significantly to our store base during the third quarter of future fiscal years as a result of new store openings or opportunistic acquisitions 
effect of new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb enacted statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r  share based payment  which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statement of earnings 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note a in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net earnings and earnings per share amounts for through  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are different from the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of earnings and earnings per share  but no impact on our financial condition or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity as of december   we had million in subordinated notes outstanding at a fixed interest rate of  and million in term and revolving loans outstanding at interest rates indexed to the eurodollar rate

market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
our primary market risk exposure is fluctuations in interest rates 
monitoring and managing this risk is a continual process carried out by the board of directors and senior management 
we manage our market risk based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
interest rate risk we hold long term debt with variable interest rates indexed to prime or eurodollar rate that exposes us to the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise
