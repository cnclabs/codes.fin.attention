restatement of financial statements in  we restated our previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended december     and the interim periods of  primarily related to adjustments to deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues 
additionally  we have restated our previously issued unaudited financial statements for the first three interim periods of  related to deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues  certain reconciliations of our funeral and cemetery trust assets and deferred revenues  and other reconciliations 
all applicable amounts relating to these restatements have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financials statements in this form k 
additionally  the company has concluded that the impact of these adjustments to the periods prior to january  were considered to be not material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the company has recorded the net impact of the adjustments of million income before tax as a correction of an error in its restated march  consolidated financial data 
deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues prior to prior to the implementation of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  the company recorded revenues for cemetery merchandise or services at the time the contract was signed by the customer 
the estimated costs to deliver merchandise and perform services were charged to expense at the time the contract was signed and a corresponding liability was recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this liability was periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated costs to deliver merchandise and services 
when the company delivered merchandise or performed services under a customer s cemetery contract  our accounting policy required cemetery personnel to record such delivery or performance into the accounting system 
this entry reduced the corresponding liability as the obligation was satisfied 
effective january   we adopted sab we determined that the accounting policy for recognition of preneed cemetery merchandise or service revenue should be changed from the time of sale to the time of delivery or performance 
undelivered 
table of contents merchandise and services would be recorded as deferred revenue at the contract sale price and revenue from such merchandise and services would be recognized when delivered or performed 
in the latter part of  we identified preneed cemetery merchandise and services that had been previously delivered  but the delivery had not been input into our accounting system in a timely manner 
when identified  these items were recognized as revenues and disclosed as changes in estimates in the period identified 
deliveries made in a period other than when they were ultimately recognized as a change in estimate are referred to as out of period deliveries 
during through september  we identified approximately million of preneed cemetery contract items that were out of period deliveries  which means that these items had been delivered or performed but the revenue had not been recognized in the appropriate period of delivery 
these items were originally recognized as revenues and disclosed as changes in estimates in the periods from through offsetting the million was million of cemetery revenue from through  which represent the effects of subsequent years being restated into the appropriate earlier period as detailed in the table below 
first three quarters of dollars in millions unaudited total reductions in cemetery revenues for out of period deliveries effects of subsequent years being restated into the appropriate period net restatement of cemetery revenues for out of period deliveries additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded adjustments to prior periods totaling million to report additional cemetery merchandise and service revenue in the period that such items were delivered or performed 
the difference between the million and the million described above is that the cemetery contract items within the million were previously identified by the company and were recognized as revenue and disclosed as a change in estimate in the period identified 
the cemetery contract items within the million were not previously identified or recognized as revenue by the company prior to the fourth quarter of the distribution of the million was restated as follows dollars in millions total increased revenues for items for which delivery or performance occurred  but no revenue was recognized cumulative effect pretax total revenues for items for which delivery or performance occurred  but no revenue was recognized 

table of contents activity in  we initiated a project to physically verify approximately million individual cemetery contract items to determine whether merchandise and services previously sold had been delivered 
approximately of the million individual cemetery contract items have been reviewed to date 
we expect to complete the review of the remaining individual cemetery contract items by may as a result of this review  we have adjusted our cemetery deferred revenues for the individual cemetery contract items reviewed to date 
additionally  we recorded an adjustment for the remaining items to be reviewed during the completion of the verification project 
we have determined these adjustments to be material to our consolidated financial statements for the first three interim periods of as a result  the company has restated its financial statements for the first three interim periods of the company evaluated the materiality of these adjustments on its financial statements issued prior to january  and concluded that the impact of these adjustments is not material to any quarterly or annual period prior to january  as a result  the company has recorded the cumulative effect of these adjustments in its restated march  quarterly financial data as a correction of an error 
the effect of the adjustments to our cemetery deferred revenues are detailed in the section below effect of restatements 
trust and cemetery deferred revenue verification project during  the company began the implementation of fin r  the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act  and the implementation of our new point of sale system 
the trust verification project included three primary components preneed cemetery merchandise and service trusts  preneed funeral merchandise and service trusts  and cemetery perpetual care trusts 
as the project progressed  we assessed the status and adjusted the general ledger accounts accordingly 
in december  and june   we made certain adjustments to our consolidated financial statements based on our best estimate at the time 
the adjustments were influenced by the percentage of verifications completed and the expected error rate of uncompleted verifications 
as of december   the company has completed its verification procedures for its funeral and cemetery trust assets and funeral trust deferred revenue 
the completion of the trust verification project resulted in an adjustment to our consolidated statement of operations 
as a result of this adjustment  the company has reevaluated previous adjustments related to these verifications as mentioned above and the impact to prior periods 
we believe that these adjustments have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements for the first three interim periods of as a result  the company has restated its financial statements for the first three interim periods of the company evaluated the materiality of these adjustments on its financial statements issued prior to january  and concluded that the impact of these adjustments is not material to any quarterly or annual period prior to january  as a result  the company has recorded the cumulative effect of these adjustments in its restated march  quarterly financial data as a correction of an error 
these verification matters did not have an impact on our reported cash balance or cash flows in any period mentioned above as amounts that were deposited or withdrawn from trust by the company were appropriately reported in the statement of cash flows in the appropriate period 
operating leases and other adjustments the company initiated a review of our accounting practices and determined that the company would adjust its method of accounting for certain types of operating leases related primarily to the company s funeral home properties 
historically  the company has recorded operating lease expense  related primarily to funeral home properties  over the initial lease term without regard to reasonably assured renewal options or fixed escalation provisions 
the company will now calculate its straight line operating lease expense with consideration of such reasonably assured renewal options and fixed escalation provisions  to the extent necessary  in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases 
the company evaluated the materiality of these adjustments related to operating leases on its financial statements and concluded that the incremental impact of these adjustments is not material to any quarterly or annual period 
as a result  the company has recorded the cumulative effect of these adjustments in its restated march  quarterly financial statements as a correction of an error 
during  we also performed various other reconciliations 
these reconciliations primarily resulted from the conversion of our point of sale system 
the effect of these adjustments  when combined with the other adjustments described above  are material to the

total materiality a matter is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person would consider it important 
the staff of the sec expressed their views on materiality in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
materiality sab 
sab states that the formulation of materiality in the accounting literature is in substance identical to the formulation used by the courts in interpreting the federal securities laws 
the supreme court has held that a fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that thefact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available 
under the governing principles  an assessment of materiality requires that one views the facts in the context of the surrounding circumstances or the total mix of information 
in the context of a misstatement of a financial statement item  while the total mix includes the size in numerical or percentage terms of the misstatement  it also includes the factual context in which the user of financial statements would view the financial statement item 
in other words  one must consider both quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing an item s materiality 
sab states that the use of a numerical analysis or a percentage threshold can be an initial step in assessing materiality 
but quantifying in percentage terms  the magnitude of a misstatement is only the beginning of an analysis of materiality 
quantitative analysis the company has performed a quantitative analysis for the twelve months ended december     and  and each quarter of and for the adjustments related to certain verifications of our funeral and cemetery trust assets and funeral deferred revenues  deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues  and accounting of operating leases and other various verifications 
in addition to analysis of the impact to net income of the company s consolidated statement of operations  consideration was given to the funeral and cemetery segment as further described in exhibit b of the sab analysis

we have changed our method of accounting for insurance funded preneed contracts as we have concluded that our insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not assets and liabilities as defined by statement of financial accounting concepts no 
 elements in financial statements 
therefore  we have removed from our consolidated balance sheet amounts relating to insurance funded preneed funeral contracts previously recorded in preneed funeral receivables and trust investments and deferred preneed funeral revenues  which at december  and  were  and  respectively 
the removal of these amounts did not have an impact on our consolidated stockholders equity  results of operations or cash flows 
see note five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information on insurance related preneed funeral balances 
our company at december   service corporation international sci or the company operated  funeral service locations and cemeteries 
we also had a minority interest equity investment in funeral operations in france 
in addition to our funeral and cemetery operations  we own kenyon international emergency services kenyon  a company that engages in mass fatality and emergency response services 
our funeral and cemetery operations are organized into a north american division covering the united states and canada  a european division primarily consisting of operations in france and germany  and an other foreign division including operations in south america and singapore 
at december   we also owned businesses in argentina and uruguay that were classified as discontinued operations 
in february  we sold our businesses in argentina and uruguay 
see note twenty one to the financial statements in item of this form k 
for the year ended december   our north american funeral and cemetery operations represented of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated gross profits 
at december   we owned and operated  funeral service locations and cemeteries in north america 
our operations in north america are organized into major markets and middle markets 
major markets are characterized by areas with large populations such as houston  new york  and chicago 
middle markets have relatively smaller populations and include areas such as southern louisiana  memphis  tennessee  and lynchburg  virginia 
each major and middle market is led by a market director with responsibility for funeral and cemetery operations as well as preneed sales 
within each market  the funeral homes and cemeteries realize efficiencies by sharing common resources such as personnel  preparation services and vehicles 
there are three market support centers in north america to assist major and middle market directors with financial  administrative and human resource needs 
these support centers are located in houston  new york and los angeles 
the market support centers help facilitate the execution of corporate strategies  coordinate communications between the field and corporate offices and serve as liaisons for implementation of policies and procedures 
our competitive strengths industry leader 
sci is the leading provider of funeral  cremation and cemetery services in north america 
there are six other major publicly traded companies that operate in our industry in north america alderwoods group  stewart enterprises  arbor memorial services  carriage services  stonemore group  and keystone north america 
our revenues in north america are more than twice the size of our next largest competitor alderwoods group and are approximately equal to the combined revenues of these six other 
table of contents public companies 
despite some consolidation  the industry remains fragmented 
we estimate that the public companies mentioned above and sci combined generate approximately of total industry revenue in north america 
the other is generated by independent funeral and cemetery operators 
geographically diverse network 
we operate businesses in north america in states and seven canadian provinces 
we believe we are able to provide funeral services to more than of the households in the united states 
we believe this comprehensive national coverage enables us to be the only company in our industry to successfully implement a national branding strategy and to develop alliances with national strategic partners 
both of these initiatives are discussed below as part of our long term revenue growth opportunities 
national branding strategy 
in  we launched the first national branding strategy in the funeral service industry in north america under the name dignity memorial 
while this branding process is intended to emphasize our seamless national network of funeral service locations and cemeteries  the original names associated with acquired locations generally remain the same 
the dignity brand name is a co brand to the existing name of the business 
signage  advertising and promotional efforts emphasize both names 
we believe that a national brand gives us a competitive advantage 
this is discussed as part of our long term revenue growth opportunities described below 
favorable demographics over the long term 
the population is aging at an unprecedented rate 
according to the us census bureau  the number of persons years or older totaled million in they represented of the population  or about one in every eight americans 
the number of americans aged and older is expected to climb to approximately of the total population by  and to approximately by approximately of all deaths in the united states are at ages and older 
we believe these demographic trends will provide a growing demand in the future for our services on both an atneed and preneed basis 
stable revenues and cash flows 
our core business can be described as stable  with relatively predictable revenue and cash flows on an annual basis 
we believe our ability to consistently generate strong cash flows sets us apart from others in the industry 
this stability is enhanced by a large backlog of future revenues associated with preneed funeral and cemetery sales 
in north america  our backlog of preneed funeral and cemetery sales consists of more than billion of revenues that will be recognized in future periods 
these unfulfilled preneed funeral and cemetery contracts are primarily supported by investments in trust funds or third party insurance policies 
financial flexibility 
we believe we have significant opportunities to grow shareholder value due to our strong cash flows and liquidity  and modest debt maturities in the near term 
for a further discussion about our financial flexibility  please see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k 
business challenges no meaningful near term increase in the numbers of deaths 
the numbers of deaths in the united states are not expected to increase meaningfully in the near term 
modern advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles are contributing to record levels of life expectancy in the united states 
in  life expectancy in the united states reached years according to the centers for disease control and prevention 
the baby boom generation is expected to have an impact on the numbers of deaths in the future  however  the first baby boomers do not reach age until the year increasing trend toward cremation 
in north america  social trends  such as a mobile  less rooted society  religious changes  environmental issues and cultural preferences are driving an increasing preference for cremation 
cremation rates in the united states have grown from approximately in to approximately in according to the cremation association of north america 
cremation rates in canada during this same period have grown from approximately to approximately 
sci is the largest provider of cremation services in north america where approximately of the total funeral services we perform are cremation services 
our cremation mix is greater than the national average due to the high concentration of properties we own in high cremation states including california  florida  and arizona where cremation rates exceed 
the mix of cremation in our business has been increasing approximately to basis points each year and we expect this trend to continue in the near term 
cremation services historically have generated less revenue and gross profit dollars than traditional funeral services that involve burials 
additionally  the cremation consumer may choose not to purchase cemetery property or merchandise 
industry research has shown that most consumers choose cremation for reasons other than cost  which we believe provides us significant opportunities to better serve the cremation consumer 
we believe we are well positioned to respond to this 
table of contents trend and have experienced initial success through the use of contemporary marketing strategies and unique product and service offerings that specifically appeal to cremation consumers 
see a further discussion regarding initiatives to address cremation as part of our long term revenue growth opportunities described below 
increasing competition from low cost retailers 
in recent years there has been an influx of retail outlets and internet websites specializing in the sale of funeral and cemetery products  particularly caskets  vaults and markers 
while these types of businesses have grown in numbers and have caused pricing pressure in certain markets  we do not believe they are having a material impact on our consolidated financial results at this time 
as we continue to develop strategies that are centered on creating a meaningful experience for the consumer with a greater focus on innovative service offerings and less emphasis on traditional product offerings  we expect the influence of these types of businesses will be even less 
regulatory and litigation exposure 
our industry is heavily regulated at the federal and state levels 
although we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations  there is a continuous movement toward a stricter regulatory environment 
our compliance department strives to keep our businesses up to date on changes in regulation and to develop programs to monitor our compliance with various regulations 
from time to time  we are also exposed to matters that result in litigation 
we work diligently to investigate and resolve such litigation as quickly and thoroughly as possible and have placed a great deal of focus throughout the company on litigation avoidance practices and programs 
lastly  as a public company  compliance with regulations such as the sarbanes oxley act has become increasingly costly and time consuming for our company 
the path to growth we have made substantial progress in reducing debt and improving cash flow since our current capital structure and liquidity afford us significant financial flexibility 
our primary focus is now on initiatives that will grow revenues and earnings 
we believe strategies centered on our national brand  dignity memorial  and other revenue growth initiatives  along with a focus on cost management  can provide the framework for sustainable growth over the longer term 
improving the infrastructure historically  our infrastructure did not allow us to fully realize the inherent efficiencies of our business organization 
as a result  we were unable to capitalize on all of the benefits of standardization  technology  and process improvement 
beginning in late and continuing through  we moved to capture more fully the inherent economies of scale of our business by reformulating our infrastructure 
this has been accomplished by redesigning our sales organization  improving business and financial processes  outsourcing certain of our accounting functions including accounts payable and payroll  and expanding our existing trust administration and information technology outsourcing programs 
in and continuing through  we also implemented a new information system in our field locations 
this new system replaced three separate contract entry systems and integrated these functions into one 
at december   the new information system is fully implemented and functioning as intended 
having simplified our sales approach and redesigned our financial  technical and administrative infrastructure  we were able to make significant changes to the field management structure in late the former management structure consisted of multiple layers and two organizations sales and operations 
the new management structure is based on a major market and middle market concept with the understanding that our markets and businesses are not all the same and can benefit from different management approaches 
we eliminated the dual management organizational structure  and now have one person responsible for each market who has the ability to lead in a multi segment environment 
this individual is charged with the responsibility of growing our business and maintaining a commitment to the dignity memorial standards and brand 
building the brand sci has implemented the first national brand in the funeral service industry 
this brand is called dignity memorial 
we believe that a national brand name will provide us access to new customers over the long term given the increasingly mobile nature of families in north america 
we believe consumers are less likely to know a funeral director personally or live in the same area as past generations who may have used funeral home services before 
a favorable experience with dignity memorial through one of our national advertising or community outreach programs  attending a funeral service at a dignity location  or through previous use of a dignity provider may influence a consumer to choose one of our funeral homes 

table of contents internally  we are focused on ensuring that we have consistency in service standards and processes across our network of businesses 
we want every customer interaction to be the standard dignity interaction  which is based upon values of integrity  respect  enduring relationships and service excellence 
externally  we continue to enhance signage and local advertising efforts using the dignity name and logo 
through our national brand we are also the sponsor of several nationally recognized community programs including dignity memorial escape school www 
escapeschool 
com  which provides parents and their children with critical abduction prevention and escape techniques  dignity memorial smart and safe seniors www 
smartandsafe 
com  which educates seniors about consumer fraud  cons and scams  travel safety and other topics  and the vietnam wall experience www 
vietnamwallexperience 
com  a traveling  three quarter sized replica of the vietnam veterans memorial in washington  dc in  we rolled out a marketing campaign to promote awareness of our national brand name throughout north america 
the campaign focused on the distinct benefits and values that set dignity memorial apart from other providers 
the marketing approach utilized response driven communications executed through television  print  radio  direct mail  point of purchase collateral materials  the internet and yellow pages 
those requesting additional information are directed to a local dignity provider 
in  the campaign reached designated market areas  or more than of all households in the united states  according to nielsen media research 
growing our revenues we have made significant improvements to our cost structure in the last two years  however  we realize that to achieve sustainable long term earnings growth  we must also increase our revenues 
we believe we can be successful in this regard by developing the dignity brand and focusing on our customers concerns and satisfaction 
the world of funeral service is changing 
as aging baby boomers begin to contemplate and deal with the realities of death  they bring with them new attitudes  ideas  requirements and preferences when it comes to observing the final stage of life 
traditional rituals associated with funerals are transitioning to new and modern ways to personalize and create a meaningful experience 
through our dignity brand we are developing more contemporary and comprehensive products and services that we believe will help the consumer create a personal experience as well as help them with the administrative and legal challenges that occur when a loved one dies 
some of the exclusive items offered through dignity providers include grief counseling services offered hours a day  days a year  a legal services membership  and internet memorial archive capabilities through making everlasting memories  or mem www 
mem 
com 
mem publishes written biographies  photos  memories and tributes shared by loved ones around the world that capture the essence of one s life 
a product that is particularly helpful to our consumers is the aftercare planner a comprehensive organization system that helps families manage the many business details that arise after a death occurs 
dignity benefits also include the bereavement travel program  a unique feature that allows customers to obtain special rates on airfare  car rentals and hotel accommodations for family and friends who travel from out of town to attend funeral  cremation or memorial services 
importantly  these products and services appeal to both burial and cremation consumers 
we are also focused on offering consumers new ways to personalize funeral services and create value in the experience 
examples include creating movies from pictures that span the person s life and important events  displaying items that were special to the individual or that reflect a hobby  having a dove  butterfly or balloon release  or holding a memorial service in a favorite place such as a park  marina or sports venue 
near term revenue growth opportunities dignity packaged plans 
our national brand name represents a unique set of packaged funeral and cremation plans offered exclusively through our network on an atneed and preneed basis 
these packages are designed to simplify customer decision making and include the unique value added products and services described above that have traditionally been unavailable through funeral service locations 
the plans also offer the security of a service guarantee and national transferability of preneed services to any of more than  dignity memorial providers in north america 
in  we continued to achieve high customer satisfaction ratings  as measured by independent surveys completed by consumers three weeks following a funeral 
we believe this is largely attributable to the value consumers receive when they select a dignity package 
when dignity packages are sold  it results in significant incremental revenue and gross profit margin per funeral service compared to non dignity sales due to the comprehensive product and service offerings they provide 

table of contents in early  we began to develop dignity memorial packaged cemetery plans 
these plans are being tested in a limited number of locations 
after completing a successful test  we intend to begin the roll out of this packaged plan initiative to our cemeteries in mid contemporary funeral merchandising strategies 
in  approximately of the total funeral consumers we served selected a dignity packaged plan 
on a preneed basis  approximately of funeral preneed contracts sold were dignity plans 
we believe we can increase the selection rate of the dignity packaged plans through improved merchandising strategies that place less emphasis on traditional funeral merchandise and more focus on the comprehensive product and service offerings unique to dignity memorial providers 
in late  we began to roll out enhanced merchandise displays and other presentation models in our funeral homes that offer personalization options 
in addition  funeral personnel at each of these locations have completed a comprehensive training and certification program to ensure their effectiveness and optimal customer satisfaction 
contemporary cemetery marketing strategies 
we are beginning to use more contemporary marketing techniques within our cemetery segment 
we have begun to employ a tiered product model that emphasizes a wide range of product and service offerings  including a variety of grave spaces at various price levels  cremation gardens  mausoleums  lawn crypts and niches 
we are particularly focused on the development of high end cemetery property such as private family estates 
in late  we also developed and began to implement a standardized pricing methodology for each of our cemeteries 
this approach incorporates marketplace demographic information and data about competitive cemeteries in the market  as well as historical retail and wholesale prices 
this new pricing methodology complements our tiered product strategy and ensures that we are capturing appropriate values for the different levels of our products 
improved management structure 
in late  we eliminated the dual management structures of sales and operations and replaced them with a single line business management structure 
in addition to reducing costs  this new structure is intended to have our strongest business managers focused on producing favorable financial results in each of our markets 
under the old structure  multiple persons shared accountability and responsibility for financial results in multiple markets 
now accountability rests solely in the market director in charge of the geographical area that he or she manages 
under the new structure  many of the administrative and financial functions are now handled by market support centers 
we believe this new structure allows for greater focus on developing people  growing market share  and improving profitability 
preneed sales 
at december   the backlog of revenues associated with unfulfilled preneed contracts sold for funeral and cemetery merchandise and services in north america totaled more than billion 
we believe that the sale of preneed goods and services is a primary driver of maintaining and growing market share 
it also provides a level of predictability and stability to our revenues and cash flows 
over the last two years  we have redesigned our sales organization to tailor our approach to emerging customer preferences  to reduce costs  and to increase our effectiveness 
we eliminated certain lead generation programs and incentive travel programs and moved to an approach that is based on personal referrals and standardized professional certification 
we also shifted from a compensation model that was solely based on commissions to one where sales counselors can receive a portion of sales compensation through a draw with the opportunity to earn a bonus if certain sales targets are achieved 
we are continuing to invest in our sales organization in through continued training and certification programs 
an important advantage of sci preneed sales for consumers  besides protecting them from having to make important decisions at a difficult time and locking in prices at today s level  is the ability to transfer preneed contracts to funeral homes and cemeteries throughout our geographically diverse network of properties 
long term revenue growth opportunities enhancing cremation opportunities 
to grow core revenues and profits  we believe we must capitalize on the opportunities provided by the growing cremation trend 
we believe a successful cremation strategy is built on product differentiation  personalization and simplicity 
along with the sale of dignity memorial cremation plans  we are developing new displays to be used in the arrangement process that clearly explain the products and services available to cremation consumers 
we also own and operate national cremation  which specifically targets the cremation consumer 
within the cemetery segment  we are promoting cremation gardens  which are separate sections located within certain of our cemeteries where cremated remains can be permanently placed and that contain other unique memorialization products 
developing access to new customers 
we believe that sci has opportunities to grow market share due to its size and geographic diversity 
as discussed earlier  we believe that a national brand name will provide us access to new customers over the long term 

table of contents our centralized marketing effort will utilize information from our broad customer databases to identify geographic  demographic and lifestyle information about our consumers in order to promote awareness of the dignity memorial brand name  our local names and our provider network in the most efficient and effective manner 
in addition  we will continue to capitalize on our nationwide network of providers to develop affinity relationships with large groups of individuals to whom we can market our products and services 
such relationships include employers  social organizations and insurance companies 
our most strategic affinity partnership today is with the veterans of foreign wars and ladies auxiliary whose membership exceeds two million 
over the longer term  we believe such groups can be a key influence in the funeral home selection process 
we continue to develop marketing strategies that target specific ethnic groups 
as an example  we are developing a brand of businesses that specifically appeal to the hispanic population 
this brand is called funeraria del ngel funeral home of the angel 
according to the united states census bureau  the hispanic population reached million in  accounting for about one half of the million residents added to the nation s population since census we currently operate funeraria del ngel in california locations  three chicago locations and six affiliated locations in miami 
expanding through acquisition  construction  or franchise 
we are also targeting expansion through acquisition or construction in the top markets in north america where probable investment returns will exceed our cost of capital 
we will focus future growth capital deployment in the major metropolitan markets where there is a large population base 
in areas with large populations  the businesses are more institutional and less dependent on an individual  it is more conducive to have multiple businesses and realize economies of scale through clustering  we can benefit more from using contemporary marketing strategies  and it is easier to attract quality management 
in states where allowed  we intend to focus construction efforts on developing more combination operations by building funeral homes on our existing cemeteries 
combination operations create synergies between funeral and cemetery functions and provide consumers the convenience of making all arrangements at a single location 
over the longer term  the potential for a franchising opportunity exists for further expansion in the smaller markets 
in a franchise relationship we could recruit independent funeral providers to join the dignity memorial network and earn fees for a comprehensive range of services that we could provide to the franchisee all at very little or no capital cost to us 
developing our people 
a key objective that we believe will have a favorable impact on our future growth and success is building a best in class workforce 
we have developed a comprehensive education strategy in an online campus format called dignity university 
dignity university features job focused curriculum for each position in the company 
upon completion of coursework  participants are required to pass examinations to be certified in their individual jobs 
dignity university uses a blended approach to learning using a combination of traditional classroom  web based courses  virtual classroom and on the job training for the approximately  individuals that we employ in north america 
in conjunction with dignity university  we use an online performance management tool that employees use to document their annual key objectives 
objectives are balanced between financial  operations  customer market  and leadership employee development 
these objectives are then weighted by management and linked to incentive compensation 
during the year  managers monitor and provide regular feedback on progress towards these objectives 
training and development courses are assigned as needed 
focusing on customer loyalty 
we began to track customer satisfaction in our funeral segment in through the use of independent surveys mailed to every consumer three weeks following the funeral 
on average  we receive more than of the surveys back 
through statistically weighted questions  we are able to track satisfaction scores at the funeral home  region  and company levels 
results are used to share best practices and develop training programs in areas where weaknesses are identified 
during  over of the respondents in north america indicated that they were likely to recommend our services 
in  we moved to a new program with jd power and associates  one of the world s premier marketing firms specializing in customer satisfaction 
our new survey to client families utilizes a combined approach measuring satisfaction and loyalty and the relationship between the two 
the new survey will be used for both funeral and cemetery consumers and will be available in three different languages 
after completing a successful test of the new measurement tool  the new survey was launched on a national basis in march 
table of contents becoming the preplanning experts 
as the baby boom generation ages  many are becoming more aware of their own mortality or facing their parents approaching need for funeral and burial arrangements 
while research indicates high public approval of the pre planning concept  the percentage of north americans who have actually completed such arrangements is quite small 
historically we have focused on preplanning and prefunding funeral arrangements 
our focus for the long term is developing a comprehensive marketing strategy to give consumers the opportunity to make the decisions about their funeral and to choose a dignity memorial funeral provider without paying in advance if they choose not to do so 
based on research and testing with members of the veterans of foreign wars in seminars conducted in and  we have found initial success in creating a commitment pattern on behalf of the consumer without funding 
critical accounting policies  new accounting pronouncements and accounting changes our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
estimates and assumptions affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date 
actual results could differ from such estimates due to uncertainties associated with the methods and assumptions underlying our critical accounting measurements 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to revenue recognition  the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and the use of estimates 
revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are performed 
our trade receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
we sell price guaranteed preneed funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of preneed funeral contracts  including accumulated trust earnings  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are performed see notes three  four  and five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is performed or merchandise is delivered 
revenue associated with cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of sfas no 
 accounting for the sales of real estate sfas 
under sfas  revenue from constructed cemetery property is not recognized until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
revenue related to the preneed sale of unconstructed cemetery property is deferred until it is constructed and of the sales price is collected 
revenue associated with sales of preneed merchandise and services is not recognized until the merchandise is delivered or the services are performed see notes three  four  and six to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we test for impairment of goodwill using a two step approach as prescribed in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the first step of our goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we do not record an impairment of goodwill in instances where the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount 
the second step of our goodwill impairment test is required only in situations where the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value as determined in the first step 
in such instances  we compare the implied fair value of goodwill as defined in sfas to its carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
fair market value of a reporting until is determined using a calculation based on multiples of revenue and multiples of ebitda of both sci and its competitors 
based on our tests at september  and september   we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas we apply the requirements of sfas no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas to test for impairment of our deferred selling costs as prescribed by the aicpa industry guide  life and health insurance entities 
accordingly  when circumstances indicate that actual experience for a portfolio of contracts  regardless of the year of origin  may result in losses  we assess whether the expected gross contract revenues for each portfolio of preneed funeral contracts or preneed cemetery contracts less all related expected contract costs is sufficient to cover the current unamortized deferred selling costs associated with each portfolio 
if it is concluded that deferred selling costs for a portfolio of contracts exceeds the related gross contract revenue less expected contract costs  the excess is charged to expense 
for purposes of applying this policy  a portfolio of preneed funeral contracts or preneed cemetery contracts is comprised of all such contracts executed within a given market ie an area of operation 
we believe this is the most appropriate way to evaluate impairment because it is consistent with the manner in which we acquire  service  and measure the profitability of our preneed funeral and cemetery contracts 
our sales organization is organized by market  and the selling costs incurred and deferred specifically relate to the preneed funeral and cemetery deferred revenues recorded in the operating market 
in  the company performed an impairment test for cemetery and funeral deferred selling costs with no impairment indicated 
our systems do not allow us to track cash flow at the individual contract level as defined by sfas for preneed funeral and cemetery contracts 
further  we do not believe that evaluation for impairment at the individual contract level is required by sfas or sfas we believe the lowest level of identifiable cash flows associated with our preneed funeral and cemetery activities is at our market level of operations 
the contracts are homogenous at this level 
therefore  the assumptions at this level would be the same as on an individual contract level 

table of contents we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets to be held and used be reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to us are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date 
actual results could differ from such estimates due to uncertainties associated with the methods and assumptions underlying our critical accounting measurements 
key estimates used by management  among others  include allowances we provide various allowances and or cancellation reserves for our funeral and cemetery preneed and atneed receivables  our preneed funeral and preneed cemetery deferred revenues  as well as for our funeral and cemetery deferred selling costs 
these allowances are based on an analysis of historical trends and include  where applicable  collection and cancellation activity 
these estimates are impacted by a number of factors  including changes in economy  relocation  and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation 
valuation of trust investments with the implementation of revised fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin r  as of march   we replaced receivables due from trust assets at cost with the actual trust investments recorded at market value 
the trust investments include marketable securities that are classified as available for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
where quoted market prices are not available  we obtain estimates of fair value from the managers of the private equity funds  which are based on the market value of the underlying real estate and private equity investments 
these market values are based on contract offers for the real estate or the managers appraisals of the venture capital funds 
depreciation of long lived assets we depreciate our long lived assets over their estimated useful lives 
these estimates of useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions or changes in regulatory requirements 
in  we changed the estimated useful life of our existing information technology systems as a result of the decision to implement a new north america point of sale system and an upgraded general ledger system 
we recognized approximately million of additional amortization expense related to this change in estimate in and did not recognize any additional amortization expense in as the system was fully amortized in deferred selling costs our policy is to defer selling costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of preneed funeral trust funded only and preneed cemetery contracts  and to expense such costs in proportion to the revenue recognized 
this capitalization and amortization model follows the provisions of sfas  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas 
the selling costs subject to deferral are the pool of compensation expense and related fringe costs incurred by the company s sales counselors and sales managers 
other selling costs associated with the sales and marketing of preneed funeral and cemetery contracts eg  lead procurement costs  brochures and marketing materials  advertising and general administrative costs are expensed as incurred 
deferral rates are determined for the following preneed funeral contracts preneed cemetery contract items interment rights burial property merchandise services these deferral rates are based on the ratio of the selling compensation and fringe costs to preneed funeral and cemetery production in dollars weighted accordingly in the manner for which the counselor is compensated with interment rights  or burial property  being the highest and preneed cemetery services being the lowest compensation to the counselor 
in developing the deferral rates  the company reviews various rate scenarios to ensure the finalized rates  when applied to forecasted production dollars  are reasonable compared to forecasted selling compensation 
additionally  the developed deferral rates are reviewed annually for reasonableness compared to current and historical commission rates used by the company 
as preneed funeral and cemetery contracts are processed  the rates are applied systematically to the production dollars and the resulting amount is deferred 
as a result  the funeral and cemetery deferred selling costs are only generated when preneed funeral and cemetery contract production is recorded 
therefore  these deferred selling costs vary with and relate directly to the production of the business 
the company has separate deferred selling cost accounts related to preneed funeral  preneed cemetery interment rights  preneed cemetery merchandise  and preneed cemetery services 
the deferred preneed funeral and cemetery revenue accounts are recorded similarly 
periodically  the selling costs deferred are compared to the actual costs incurred to ensure there is not a significant variance between the two 
the deferred selling costs are expensed in proportion to the revenue when recognized proportionate method 
this is determined annually by the ratio of the unamortized deferred selling costs funeral  cemetery interment rights  cemetery merchandise and cemetery services to the associated deferred revenue  and systematically applying this ratio against the deferred selling cost accounts as the applicable revenues are recognized 
we do not attribute deferred selling costs to each individual contract or each item in the case of cemetery deferred selling costs because our systems do not currently have the complete functionality to defer and amortize the costs and we have no other cost effective means by which to do so 
we believe using the proportionate method of amortization and the homogenous nature of the  preneed funeral contracts and million of preneed cemetery contract items as separated by interment rights  merchandise and services allows for a systematic match of costs with related revenues 
taxes our ability to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets requires us to achieve certain future earnings levels 
we have established a valuation allowance against a portion of deferred tax assets and could be required to further adjust that valuation allowance if market conditions change materially and future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly different from our current estimates 
we intend to permanently reinvest the unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries in those businesses outside the united states and  therefore  have not provided for deferred federal income taxes on such unremitted foreign earnings 
pension cost our pension costs and liabilities are actuarially determined based on certain assumptions  including expected long term rates of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to compute future benefit obligations 
in and prior years  it was our policy to use a discount rate for return on assets comparable to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the company s pension benefits 
actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in the assumptions  or experience differences from those assumptions  were amortized over the remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans 
in  we 
table of contents changed our method of accounting for gains and losses on pension assets and obligations to recognize such gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations during the year in which they occur 
we recorded net pension expense reflecting estimated returns on plan assets and obligations for our interim financial statements 
under the new accounting policy  upon the review of our annual remeasurement  we recognized actual gains and losses on plan assets and obligations 
see notes four and sixteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for more information related to pensions 
we used a assumed rate of return on plan assets in as a result of a high allocation of equity securities within the plan assets 
in  the rate of return on plan assets is not applicable as we recognize gains and losses on plan assets during the year in which they occur 
at december   of the plan assets were invested in core diversified and market neutral hedge funds  of the plan assets were equity securities and the remaining of plan assets were fixed income securities 
as of december   the equity securities were invested approximately in us large cap investments  in international equities and in us small cap investments 
in connection with the million infusion of funds into the plan in early  we rebalanced the plan assets to have a lower percentage invested in traditional equity securities and fixed income securities and instead incorporate investments in hedge funds 
we believe that over time this reallocation will reduce the volatility with limited reduction of returns 
insurance loss reserves we purchase comprehensive general liability  morticians and cemetery professional liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured with high deductibles 
this high deductible insurance program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies 
historical insurance industry experience indicates a high degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate amount of losses associated with casualty insurance claims 
this is especially true with respect to liability and workers compensation exposures due to the extended period of time that transpires between when the claim might occur and the full settlement of such claim  often many years 
we continually evaluate loss estimates associated with claims and losses related to these insurance coverages and falling within the deductible of each coverage through the use of qualified and independent actuaries 
assumptions based on factors such as claim settlement patterns  claim development trends  claim frequency and severity patterns  inflationary trends and data reasonableness will generally effect the analysis and determination of the best estimate of the projected ultimate claim losses 
the results of these actuarial evaluations are used to both analyze and adjust our insurance loss reserves 
our independent actuaries used five actuarial methods generally accepted by the casualty actuarial society to arrive at an estimate of a range that we refer to as reasonably possible 
the actuarial standard of practice no 
asop published by the american academy of actuaries states a range of reasonable estimates is a range of estimates that could be produced by appropriate actuarial methods or alternative sets of assumptions that the actuary judges to be reasonable 
methods used to determine the company s reasonably possible range are paid and incurred loss development methods  frequency severity methods  and paid and incurred bornhuetter ferguson methods 
all of these methods were used to determine the company s reasonably possible range of insurance loss reserves for the years ended december   and the company has not changed its methodologies for determining the reasonably possible range  however  there are changes made to the assumptions as the loss development factors are updated 
these loss development factors are determined based on the company s historical loss development data and are updated annually as new data becomes available 
as a result  the loss development factors used in the december  analysis could be different from the loss development factors used in the december  analysis 
the company considers these changes in loss development factors synonymous to changes in assumptions 
the final loss estimate is not determined by weighting the methodologies  but instead is subjectively arrived at by our independent actuary considering the relative merits of the various methods and the truncated average of the various methods 
for each loss type workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability loss triangles are generated  which show the cumulative valuation of each loss period over time 
the loss components evaluated include incurred losses  paid losses  reported claim counts  and average incurred loss 
the actuarial analysis of losses uses this data to estimate future loss development or settlement value of the losses 
since these loss development factors are an estimate about future loss development  the calculation of ultimate losses is also an estimate 
the actual ultimate loss value may not be known for many years  and may differ significantly from the estimated value of the ultimate losses 
as of december   reported losses within the company s retention for workers compensation  general liability and auto liability incurred during the period may  through december  were approximately million 
the selected fully developed ultimate settlement value estimated by our independent actuary was million 
paid losses were 
table of contents million indicating a reserve requirement of million 
after considering matters discussed with our independent actuary related to this calculation  the company estimated the reserve to be million as of december  at december  and  the balances in the reserve and the related activity were as follows dollars in millions balance at december  additions payments balance at december  additions payments balance at december  our independent actuary performed a sensitivity analysis that was modeled to assess the impact of changes to the reserve pertaining to workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous adverse change to the loss development factors as summarized below 
dollars in millions sensitivity analysis workers compensation general liability auto liability total sensitivity 
the loss development factors used in the december  calculation are based on the company s actual claim history by policy year for the period beginning may  may  preneed deferred contract revenue overview during and  the company engaged in certain reconciliation procedures related to its funeral and cemetery trust assets and deferred revenues trust reconciliation project 
this reconciliation project was engaged to reconcile trust asset and liabilities by reconciling contract detail to the company s general ledger 
additionally in  the company began a cemetery contract verification project 
this project was to determine whether cemetery merchandise and services were recorded in the appropriate period when the merchandise or service was delivered or performed 
both of these projects are discussed below in more detail 
prior to december   the company has evaluated both of these projects throughout the year and has recorded adjustments related to both of these projects as enough evidential matter was obtained to estimate the outcome of certain reconciliations 
as of december   the trust reconciliation project has been completed  however a portion of the cemetery contract verification project will not be completed until may the results of this verification project will be included in the company s march st  form q 
trust reconciliation project in the latter part of  the company began reconciling the trust asset and deferred revenue contract details to the general ledger balances 
this trust reconciliation project was driven by three significant events the impact of the implementation of fin r  the implementation of controls resulting from section  and the implementation of the company s new point of sale system 
the trust reconciliation project included three primary components cemetery merchandise and service trusts  preneed funeral merchandise and service trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts 
the company has continually assessed the status of the project and adjusted the general ledger accounts accordingly 
in december  and june   the company made certain adjustments to its consolidated financial statements 
the projected adjustments were influenced by the percentage of reconciliations completed at a location level and the expected error rate of uncompleted reconciliations 
in december  the company accrued a million reduction in revenues as an adjustment for the trust reconciliation project 
this adjustment was based on management s best estimate at that time 
in june  management again assessed the progress of its trust reconciliation project 
as of june   the company had completed the trust asset reconciliations for cemetery merchandise and service trusts  preneed funeral merchandise and service trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts 
however  as of june   the company had not completed reconciliations of its deferred revenue accounts 
in order to record an adjustment to the company s june  consolidated financial statements  the company statistically sampled preneed funeral contracts from the backlog detail to determine the accuracy of deferred preneed funeral revenue and then calculated the adjustment to the general ledger based on the results of this statistical sample 
the  preneed funeral contracts sampled resulted in errors or an error rate in the backlog 
using a confidence level of  the extrapolated dollar error was million with a confidence interval of million 
from a statistical perspective  any point within the interval range is as statistically valid as another point within the range 
accordingly  the company believed that the mid point of the interval of million was the most appropriate estimate to record at that time as it represented the center of the confidence interval 
based on this mid point and based on the review of each contract with an error  the estimated impact on the company s consolidated net income was calculated 
as of june   the company recorded a million charge to its consolidated statement of operations 
this charge of million included adjustments to the completed trust asset reconciliations and estimated adjustments discussed above related to funeral deferred revenue 
as of december   the company has completed its reconciliation procedures for its trust assets and funeral deferred revenue 
as a result of this adjustment  the company has reevaluated previous adjustments related to these reconciliations and the impact to prior periods 
these reconciliation matters did not have an impact on our reported cash balance or operating cash flow in any period mentioned above as amounts that were deposited or withdrawn from trust by the company were appropriately reported in the statement of cash flows in the appropriate period 
cemetery contract verification project at december   the company restated its previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended december    and the first three quarters of  primarily related to adjustments to deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues and other items as described below 
as a result of this restatement and other events including the implementation of sox and the implementation of the company s new point of sale system  the company began a process to examine all cemetery contracts in the company s deferred preneed cemetery contract balance to ensure that revenue was recognized in the appropriate period when merchandise and services were delivered or performed 
to properly reflect cemetery merchandise and service deferred revenue at december  and recognize cemetery revenue in the period the items were physically delivered or performed  the company estimated through acceptable statistical sampling methods  the amount of deferred revenue associated with merchandise and services that had been physically delivered merchandise installed or service rendered but had not been processed in our accounting system 
the company utilized a consultant to develop the testing strategy in quantifying the amount of deferred revenue that should be recognized in prior periods 
the consultant believed the best quantification would be derived from a random sample across all cemeteries  without regard to size  based on the assumption all of our cemeteries were homogenous as to accounting policies and procedures  management structure and use of consistent accounting systems and processes 
our sample selection was a two step process  randomly selecting cemeteries out of the population of plus cemeteries and then randomly selecting twenty items from each of the cemeteries  for a total random sample of  items 
the sample results identified errors totaling  and the sample results were extrapolated to the approximately billion deferred revenue universe 
the extrapolated sample quantified the dollar amount of merchandise and service items which were still deferred in our accounting system detail  but were found to be physically delivered in periods prior to december  the amounts were divided into annual contra reserve accounts based on the ratio of the errors from each respective years of delivery to the total amount of errors discovered 
the dollar error of the projection totaled million and was recorded at december  all years from through were restated for this effort based on the year of delivery calculated above  and the cumulative amounts related to prior to were reflected in retained earnings 
this was appropriate because the company adopted sab effective january  which changed our accounting policy for recognition of preneed cemetery merchandise and services from original time of sale to the time of delivery or performance 
the distribution of the million adjustments amongst the periods was restated as follows dollars in millions total revenues for items for which delivery or performance occurred  but no revenue was recognized cumulative effect pretax total revenues for items for which delivery or performance occurred  but no revenue was recognized as of december  the company had completed of cemetery contract verifications of the largest market cemeteries consisting of approximately of our total cemetery deferred revenue 
it was determined at the end of  that the remaining of our cemeteries would not be verified until may this represented operational geographic markets of smaller but greater quantity cemeteries 
to determine the propriety of the locations not verified at december  approximately  another statistical sample was taken related only to these locations and an extrapolated error rate was quantified 
this sample was performed similarly to the sample performed at december  random sample of locations and random sampling of items at each of the locations 
this amount was compared to the remaining contra reserve account as described above to determine if any additional adjustments would be warranted 
if statistical theory holds true  one would assume the new statistical sample of the remaining locations not verified by december  would compare reasonably to the amount remaining from the original reserve  within the statistical confidence interval range  providing the characteristics of the items locations sampled in the current study are the same as those of the total sample of the previous year 
it was determined the original sample did  in fact  have an anomaly 
as previously stated  the statistical sample approach taken assumed a homogenous universe 
our miami group of cemeteries five in total  which was verified by december  was subsequently determined to be an anomaly for the reasons described below the results of the verification process for the miami group of cemeteries was much different than the remaining locations which performed the review  when comparing the amount of out of period deliveries processed those items found during the review of the detail which had physically been delivered in years prior to january  as compared to the total deferred revenue per location 
the miami locations error rate was much higher than the average of the remaining locations reviewed the management reporting structure was different in miami locations than the remaining north america operating structure  and had not previously performed a detailed  systematic review of their preneed cemetery contracts like the rest of the north american cemetery operations had completed previously 
however  excluding the miami results  the roll forward of the contra reserve account compared reasonably  within the acceptable confidence interval range  with the new statistical sample extrapolated at december  however  the confidence interval resulting from the sample was larger than anticipated million 
the company consultant reviewed the information and has agreed that the sample analysis of the current sample conforms to accepted statistical practice and the results are reasonable 
due to the anomaly which occurred in the miami operations  the company considered whether there were any other anomalies in the remaining locations to be verified in that would cause the statistical sample results to be incorrect 
to reduce the risk of discovering an additional anomaly  and to reduce the confidence interval to an acceptable range  the company selected an additional sample of the locations not selected in the initial sample additional locations and increased the sample size per location from items to items 
as a result  an additional sample items were selected  and when combined with the results of the initial sample  approximately  items were tested 
the sample results for december   considering the two samples together  calculated to be a point estimate of million with a confidence interval of million 
comparing this amount to the remaining amounts previously recorded  and excluding the effect of balance sheet only reclassification of million  the adjustment required to the company s consolidated statement of operations was a total of million 
in addition to this verification project  the company reviews  on a quarterly basis  cemetery deliveries to ensure revenue was recorded in the appropriate quarter 
the company has included such out of quarter adjustments in its proposed restatement of the first three interim periods of the company plans to be completed with the cemetery verification project by may such final results will be included in the company s form q for the quarterly period ended march  other adjustments cemetery system upgrade as a result of a system upgrade  a cemetery mst matter developed in late and early that is related to the trust reconciliation projects 
the fact that the trusts were not reconciled during this period contributed to the lack of detection of this second matter until may the system upgrade matter was corrected during the second quarter other reconciliation items in the first half of  the company undertook several reconciliation activities in addition to the trust reconciliations 
these reconciliation activities related primarily to the implementation of the company s point of sale system 
these reconciliation matters did not have an impact on our reported cash balance  operating cash flow or free cash flow in any period mentioned above as amounts that were deposited or withdrawn from trust by the company were appropriately reported in the statement of cash flows in the appropriate period 
new accounting pronouncements other than temporary impairments in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb reached consensus on the guidance provided by emerging issues task force issue eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the guidance is applicable to debt and equity securities that are within the scope of fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
eitf specifies that an impairment would be considered other than temporary unless a the investor has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of the fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment and b evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
eitf was scheduled to be effective for reporting periods ending after june  the measurement and recognition provisions relating to debt and equity securities have been delayed until the fasb issues additional guidance 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of eitf during the period ended june  the adoption of the measurement and recognition provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  results of operations  financial position  or cash flows

sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges  rather than as a portion of the inventory cost 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  results of operations  or cash flows

the effective date of sfas r is the first reporting period beginning after june   which is third quarter for our company 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we performed a cost benefit analysis comparing option pricing models 
based on this analysis  we will continue to utilize the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of our stock options 
we expect to adopt sfas r effective july  we are currently evaluating the impact that this adoption will have on our results of operations

 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this interpretation clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r 
under the provisions of fin r  we are required to consolidate certain cemeteries and trust assets 
merchandise and service trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts are considered variable interest entities because the trusts meet the conditions of paragraphs a and b of fin r 
that is  as a group  the equity investors if any do not have sufficient equity at risk and do not have the direct or indirect ability through voting or similar rights to make decisions about the trusts activities that have a significant effect on the success of the trusts 
fin r requires us to consolidate merchandise and service trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts for which we are the primary beneficiary ie  those for which we absorb a majority of the trusts expected losses 
we are the primary beneficiary of a trust whenever a majority of the assets of the trust are attributable to deposits of our customers 
consolidation of trusts we implemented fin r as of march   which resulted in the consolidation of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service trust assets and our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
no cumulative effect of an accounting change was recognized as a result of the implementation of fin r as it relates to the consolidation of the trusts 
the implementation of fin r affects certain line items on our consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations as described below  however  there is no impact to net income in the statement of operations as a result of the implementation 
additionally  the 
table of contents implementation of fin r did not result in any net changes to our consolidated statement of cash flows  however  it does require certain financing and investing activities to be disclosed 
for additional information  see notes five through eight to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
although fin r requires consolidation of most of the merchandise and service and perpetual care trusts  it does not change the legal relationships among the trusts  sci and our customers 
in the case of merchandise and service trusts  the customers are the legal beneficiaries 
in the case of cemetery perpetual care trusts  we do not have a legal right to the perpetual care trust assets 
for these reasons  upon consolidation of the trusts  we recognize non controlling interests in our financial statements to reflect third party interests in these trusts in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity sfas 
we classify deposits to merchandise and service trusts as non controlling liability interests and classify deposits to cemetery perpetual care trusts as non controlling equity interests 
we record cash received from customers that is payable to the trust  but not yet required to be deposited in the trusts as restricted cash in deferred charges and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   these pending deposits totaled  we continue to account for amounts received from customers prior to delivery of merchandise or services that are not required to be deposited in merchandise and service trusts as deferred revenue 
beginning march   we recognize net realized investment earnings of the merchandise and service trusts and perpetual care trusts  as well as the related trustee investment expenses and taxes  within other income  net 
we then recognize a corresponding expense within other income  net representing the net realized earnings of those trusts that are attributable to the non controlling interest holders 
the corresponding credit for this expense is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet in non controlling interest in funeral and cemetery trusts for merchandise and service trusts or non controlling interest in perpetual care trusts for cemetery perpetual care trusts 
the sum of these expenses recorded in other income  net offset the net realized earnings of such trusts also recognized within other income  net 
accordingly  our net income in the consolidated statement of operations is not affected by consolidation of the trusts in accordance with fin r 
to the extent the earnings of the trusts are distributed prior to the delivery of merchandise and or services  a corresponding amount of non controlling interest is reclassified to deferred revenue until the corresponding revenues are recognized 
in the case of merchandise and service trusts  we recognize as revenues  amounts previously attributed to non controlling interests and deferred revenues upon the performance of services and delivery of merchandise  including earnings accumulated in these trusts 
in the case of the cemetery perpetual care trusts  distributable earnings are recognized in cemetery revenues to the extent of qualifying cemetery maintenance costs 
prior to the implementation of fin r and the consolidation of the trusts  monies received from customers and deposited into merchandise and service trusts until maturity of the preneed contract were recorded as receivables due from trust assets 
upon implementation of fin r  we replaced receivables due from trust assets with the trust assets  at market  to the extent we were required to consolidate the trusts 
an allowance for contract cancellation is provided based on historical experience 
an allowance is no longer provided on the monies associated with the preneed contract that are held in trust  currently recorded as trust assets  but previously recorded as receivables due from trust assets 
as such  the amount has decreased since the implementation of fin r 
both the merchandise and services trusts and the cemetery perpetual care trusts hold investments in marketable securities that are classified as available for sale under the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
in accordance with sfas  available for sale securities of the trusts are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet 
using the guidance in eitf topic d  adjustments in assets and liabilities for holding gains and losses as related to the implementation of fasb statement no 
topic d  unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities of the trusts attributable to the non controlling interest holders are not recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  but are recorded as an adjustment to either non controlling interest in funeral and cemetery trusts or non controlling interest in perpetual care trusts 
therefore  unrealized gains and losses attributable to the non controlling interest holders are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to either non controlling interest in funeral and cemetery trusts or non controlling interest in perpetual care trusts 
the gross effect from applying topic d on our accumulated other comprehensive income loss is disclosed in note fifteen of the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
however  our accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the face of the balance sheet is ultimately not affected by consolidation of the trusts 

table of contents for additional discussion of our accounting policies after the implementation of fin r  see notes five through eight to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
consolidation of certain cemeteries prior to december   we operated certain cemeteries that we managed but did not own 
during our evaluation of fin r  we evaluated these cemeteries to determine whether such cemeteries were within the scope of fin r 
the investment capital of these cemeteries was financed by the company in exchange for a long term sales  accounting  and cash management agreement 
in accordance with this agreement  we received the majority of the cash flows from these cemeteries 
additionally  we absorb the majority of these cemeteries expected losses and receive a majority of the cemeteries residual returns 
as a result  the company determined itself to be the primary beneficiary of these cemeteries and determined the long term sales  accounting  and cash management agreement to be a variable interest as defined by fin r 
given the circumstances above  the company consolidated such cemeteries at march  we recognized an after tax charge of million  representing the cumulative effect of an accounting change  as a result of consolidating these cemeteries 
the results of operations and cash flows of these cemeteries are included in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows beginning march  excluding the cumulative effect of accounting change  the effect of consolidating these entities did not have a significant impact on our reported results of operations 
insurance funded preneed funeral contracts we changed our method of accounting for insurance funded preneed contracts as we have concluded that our insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not assets and liabilities as defined by statement of financial accounting concepts no 
 elements in financial statements 
therefore  we have removed from our consolidated balance sheet amounts relating to insurance funded preneed funeral contracts previously recorded in preneed funeral receivables and trust investments and deferred preneed funeral revenues  which at december   were billion 
the removal of these amounts did not have an impact on our consolidated stockholders equity  results of operations or cash flows 
see note five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information on insurance related preneed funeral balances 
pension plans in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits sfas r 
sfas r requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
we have adopted the revised disclosure requirements 
our pension plans are frozen with no cost benefits accreting to participants except interest 
effective january   we changed our accounting for gains and losses on our pension plan assets and obligations 
we now recognize such gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations as such gains and losses are incurred under pension accounting 
prior to january   we amortized the difference between actual and expected investment returns and actuarial gains and losses over seven years except to the extent that settlements with employees required earlier recognition 
we believe the new method of accounting better reflects the economic nature of our pension plans and recognize gains and losses on the pension plan assets and obligations in the year the gains or losses occur 
as a result of this accounting change  we recognized a charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change of million net of tax as of january  this amount represents accumulated unrecognized net losses related to the pension plan assets and liabilities 
in addition  for interim periods  we record net pension expense or income reflecting estimated returns on plan assets and obligations 
we will recognize actual gains and losses on plan assets and obligations as actuarial information becomes available upon review of the annual remeasurement 
see note sixteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information on pensions 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  effective january   we recognized a charge reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change of million net of applicable taxes or 
per diluted share related to the impairment of goodwill in our north america cemetery reporting unit 
see note nine to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information on goodwill 
results of operations twelve months ended december   and in  we restated results for the fiscal years ended december    and the interim periods of additionally  in we restated results for the first three interim periods of for details relating to this restatement  see notes two and twenty two to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

the consolidated effective tax rate in was a benefit of compared to an expense of in and a benefit of in the tax rate in was favorably impacted by tax benefits realized from the disposition of our operations in france and the united kingdom and state net operating losses realized in the tax benefits from dispositions result from differences between book and tax basis and the reversal of tax liabilities that were then recorded as warranty indemnification liabilities 
in  we expect the consolidated effective tax rate for continuing operations to be approximately 

table of contents the diluted weighted average number of shares increased to million in compared to million in and million in this increase is mainly due to the conversion in june of our convertible senior notes which resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares  which were anti dilutive in and the remaining share increase is related to dilutive outstanding stock options and the contribution of common stock to our k retirement plan  which was partially offset by share repurchases 
in  we intend to reduce the number of shares outstanding through our previously announced share repurchase programs 
also effective january   we began to contribute cash to fund the company s matching contribution to its k retirement plan and discontinued funding through the use of common stock 
consolidated funeral results funeral revenues in declined million from primarily due to a decline of million in revenues associated with our french funeral operations  which were sold on march  in  revenues from funeral operations in france were million compared to million for the partial period of our ownership from january  through march  north america funeral revenue declined million primarily as a result of divestitures and an million decline in revenues from kenyon  our subsidiary that engages in mass fatality and emergency response services 
kenyon revenues were higher in than in primarily due to activity associated with the world trade center disaster 
funeral gross profits decreased million in compared to primarily as a result of a million decline in gross profits related to our former french operations which were sold in march gross profits from our french funeral operations were million in our partial period of ownership in compared to million in the full year of north america funeral gross profits increased million despite a decline in revenues 
this improvement is mainly a result of reduced overhead costs and lower pension expenses benefited by a change in pension accounting  which were partially offset by declines in kenyon revenue 
funeral revenues increased million in compared to as a result of a million increase in foreign revenues  partially offset by a decline of million in north america funeral revenues 
the increase in foreign revenues is predominantly related to our french operations and is due to increases in funeral services performed and in the average revenue per funeral  as well as favorable currency effects 
north america funeral revenues declined primarily as a result of divestitures and declines in general agency ga revenues 
ga revenues are commissions we receive from third party insurance companies when customers purchase insurance contracts from such third party insurance companies to fund funeral services and merchandise at a future date 
funeral gross profits declined million in compared to declines in north america funeral operations due to decreased revenues described above and increases in employee benefit and insurance costs were partially offset by improvements in french funeral operations which benefited from increased revenues described above and reduced depreciation expense 
consolidated cemetery results cemetery revenues increased million in compared to north america cemetery revenues increased million primarily as a result of increased recognition of property that was sold and constructed during foreign cemetery revenues consisting of cemetery businesses in chile increased million reflective of improved economic conditions in the region and favorable currency effects 
cemetery gross profits increased million in compared to and benefited from an increase in revenues described above and reductions in north america overhead costs  pension expenses and maintenance expenses 
cemetery revenues declined million in compared to primarily as a result of a million decrease in north america cemetery revenues  partially offset by improvements in foreign cemetery revenues 
this decline in north america cemetery revenues was due to divestitures and also due to the significant changes made to the sales organization in although we expected cemetery revenues to decline in from these strategic changes  we also anticipated  and realized  higher gross margins as a result 
cemetery gross profits in improved million from due primarily to reductions in preneed selling costs from a number of changes made to the sales organization to increase our effectiveness 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in included in all periods are expenses associated with the settlement of certain litigation matters 
we recognized litigation expenses net of insurance recoveries of million in  million in and in of million in compared to million in and million in additionally  in both and we recognized approximately million of accelerated system amortization expense that is not included in during  we made the decision to implement new information technology systems and  therefore  accelerated the amortization of the old systems 
these accelerated amortization costs ceased at the end of the third quarter of when amortization of the new systems commenced 

table of contents excluding litigation expenses and accelerated system amortization costs in all periods  general and administrative expenses in were million compared to million in and million in increased costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts were offset by reductions in information technology and other overhead expenses 
general and administrative expenses excluding litigation expenses and accelerated system amortization costs is a non gaap financial measure  however  we believe this non gaap measure is useful to investors as it provides a consistent basis for comparison between periods and better reflects the performance of our core operations  as it is not influenced by certain non recurring expenses 
other in  we recognized a net pretax gain from dispositions of million consisting of a million gain from the sale of our equity and debt holdings in our former united kingdom company and a million gain from the sale of our french funeral operations  partially offset by net losses associated with various dispositions in north america 
in  we recognized a net pretax gain of million primarily related to the sale of our equity holdings in our former operations in australia and spain 
in  we recognized a net pretax loss of million primarily related to an impairment charge for certain funeral and cemetery operations held for sale in north america 
for further information regarding gains and impairment losses on dispositions see note twenty to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
we recognized other operating income of million in for various adjustments made related to prior periods as a result of our verification projects and lease accounting issues described in note two of item of this form k 
in  we recognized other operating expenses of million related to severance costs and the termination of a lease contract 
in  we recognized other operating expenses of million related to market value adjustments of certain options associated with our notes due  severance costs of former employees  and expenses related to the termination of certain consulting and non compete contractual obligations 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in and million in between and  interest expense declined by million or  reflecting the success we have had in improving our balance sheet 
during this same period  total debt was reduced by more than million as a result of strong operating cash flows and a successful asset divestiture and joint venture program that produced more than million of net cash proceeds 
other income was million in compared to million in and million in the components of other income for the years presented were as follows interest income was million in compared to million in and million in cash overrides received from a third party insurance provider related to the sale of insurance funded preneed funeral contracts were million in compared to million in and million in for a further description of these cash overrides  see insurance funded preneed funeral contracts in item of this form k 
in  we recognized a million foreign currency transactional loss associated with the payment of a contingent purchase obligation in chile 
surety bond premium costs were million in compared to million in and million in the remaining income of million in  million in  and million in  is primarily attributable to net gains related to foreign currency transactions 
actual versus comparable results of operations twelve months ended december   and the table below reconciles our actual results to our comparable or same store results for the periods ended december   and we regard same store results of operations as analogous to our comparable results of operations 
we consider comparable operations as operations that were not acquired or constructed after january  or divested prior to december  therefore  in the following three year presentation  we are providing results of operations for the same funeral and cemetery locations in each of the three year periods presented

in the calculation of average revenue per funeral service  general agency ga revenues and kenyon revenues are excluded from comparable north america funeral revenue to avoid distorting our averages of normal funeral case volume

kenyon international emergency services kenyon is our disaster response subsidiary that engages in mass fatality and emergency response services 
revenues and gross profits associated with kenyon are subject to significant variation due to the nature of their operations 
north america comparable results of operations other foreign revenues and gross profits shown above are primarily related to our funeral operations in france which were sold in march since we did not own these businesses for the full year of  they are not considered comparable or same store locations 
in  comparable north america operations represented of consolidated revenues and approximately of consolidated gross profits 
the following discussion of results of operations pertains to comparable north america operations only 

table of contents comparable north america funeral comparable north america funeral revenues in declined million or less than from primarily due to an million decrease in revenues from kenyon and a decline in funeral volume  which was partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per funeral service and an increase in ga revenue 
comparable north america funeral revenues declined million in compared to primarily as a result of an million decline in ga revenue and a decline in funeral volume  which was partially offset by a million increase in kenyon revenue and an increase in the average revenue per funeral service 
ga revenue declined during as a result of an anticipated decrease in the sale of insurance funded preneed funeral contracts due to significant changes made to the sales organization in which impacted our sales effectiveness 
the number of funeral services performed declined in compared to which in turn was down from we believe these declines are consistent with trends reported by other companies in the funeral service and casket manufacturing industries and that these declines are primarily related to a decrease in the number of deaths in our relevant markets 
our review of various sources of industry data indicates that market share has increased in certain of our markets and decreased in others  however  we believe that there has not been a substantial loss of market share in our total north america business segment 
we believe that over time  the decline in our north america comparable funeral services performed will be curtailed as a result of the aging of the population and the number of initiatives we have in place to grow market share 
for a further description of our initiatives to grow revenues  see the path to growth earlier in this item of this form k 
the comparable average revenue per funeral service increased in over and increased in over the fourth quarter of represents the eighteenth consecutive quarter that we have reported an increase in our average revenue per funeral service 
this consistent growth in average revenue is largely a result of the success of our nationally branded dignity memorial packaged funeral and cremation plan initiative 
the dignity plans are focused on adding value for the consumer instead of relying on price increases 
these plans offer consumers unique products and services aimed at providing assistance with administrative and legal issues  travel needs  emotional support  and memorialization when a death occurs 
because of these comprehensive value added offerings  the packages generate significant incremental revenue per funeral service compared to non dignity sales 
the percentage of consumers selecting a dignity memorial plan has grown from approximately of the total funeral services performed in to approximately in we believe we can increase the selection rate of dignity memorial plans in by continuing to utilize technology and contemporary marketing techniques to enhance our sales opportunities 
we have been able to generate increases in the average revenue per funeral despite an increase in the rate of cremation 
of the total comparable funeral services performed in  were cremation services versus in the same period of and in in north america  there continues to be a growing trend in the number of cremations performed as an alternative to traditional funeral service dispositions 
cremation services historically have generated less revenue and gross profit dollars than traditional funeral services that involve burials 
industry research has shown that most consumers choose cremation for reasons other than cost  which we believe provides us significant opportunities to better serve the cremation consumer 
our dignity memorial packaged cremation plans have been successful in expanding the products and services that cremation consumers select 
of the total cremation services performed during  approximately were dignity memorial cremation plans 
despite a decline in funeral revenues in  funeral gross profits improved and the funeral gross margin percentage improved to in compared to in this improvement is mainly a result of reduced overhead and pension expenses which were partially offset by declines in kenyon revenue described above 
north america funeral gross profits and gross margin percentage declined in compared to primarily due to increased employee benefit costs and insurance costs which were partially offset by reductions in selling and other overhead costs 
comparable north america cemetery we demonstrated significant progress in in our cemetery segment 
north america cemetery revenue increased million or from to million 
this exceeded our original expectations and was primarily a result of increased recognition of undeveloped property that was sold in and then subsequently constructed during this is mainly attributable to the success of our focus on developing and selling high end cemetery property such as private family estates 
revenues from the sale of cemetery property are recognized only when the property is fully developed and when customer payments are at least of the total contract amount 
historically  the sale of undeveloped property preceded the period of final construction and revenue recognition by as much as five years 
we are shifting our strategy to focus on shortening the time between when property is sold and when it is constructed 

table of contents cemetery revenues declined million in compared to primarily as a result of the anticipated decrease in preneed revenues due to significant changes made to the sales organization in although we expected revenues to decline in  we also anticipated  and realized  higher gross margins as a result of those strategic changes 
cemetery gross profits increased or million in compared to and benefited from an increase in revenues and reductions in overhead costs  pension expenses and maintenance expenses 
cemetery gross profits in improved million from due primarily to reductions in preneed selling costs from a number of changes made to the sales organization to increase effectiveness 
the cemetery gross margin percentage grew to in from in and in overhead and pension expenses the improvement in funeral and cemetery gross profits in compared to and is largely a result of a reduction in overhead expenses and pension expenses 
overhead expenses from our field management and support offices and our home office are allocated to funeral and cemetery operations in north america 
in  these overhead expenses totaled million compared to million in and million in  representing a decline of million from to beginning in late and continuing through  we moved to reduce our fixed costs by reformulating our infrastructure 
we redesigned our sales organization  improved business and financial processes  and outsourced certain of our accounting functions 
in and continuing through  we implemented a new information system in our field locations 
in late  we eliminated the dual management structures of sales and operations and replaced them with a single line business management structure 
in addition to reducing costs  this new structure now has our strongest business managers focused on producing favorable financial results in each of our markets 
pension income and expense  of which a portion is included in funeral and cemetery expenses and a portion in general and administrative expenses  is related to the company s frozen cash balance pension plan and its supplemental retirement plans for certain current and former employees 
we recognized pension income of million in compared to pension expense of million and pension expense of million in the reduction in net pension expense in compared to and is primarily related to a change in accounting 
effective january   we changed the accounting for gains and losses on our pension plan assets and obligations to recognize such gains and losses as they are incurred 
prior to january   we amortized the difference between actual and expected investment returns and actuarial gains and losses over seven years except to the extent that settlements with employees required earlier recognition 
we believe the new method of accounting better reflects the economic nature of the company s pension plans and recognizes gains and losses on the pension plan assets and liabilities in the year the gains or losses occur 
for further information regarding the company s pension plans  see note sixteen in item of this form k 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources overview our primary financial objectives are to capitalize on our financial flexibility and to continue generating strong operating cash flows 
we believe that we have adequate resources to meet our near and intermediate term debt obligations  planned capital expenditures and other cash requirements  as well as to have funds available for future growth 
as of december   our cash balance was approximately million 
we also have a million credit facility that was executed in august we have no cash borrowings under this credit facility  but have used it to support million of letters of credit as of december  internally generated cash flows are a significant source of liquidity for us 
cash flow from operating activities in was million 
included in was the payment of million related to the resolution of certain legal matters  a million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan  and the payment of million to retire life insurance policy loans related to our serp and senior serp retirement programs 
excluding these items  cash flow from operating activities was million 
cash flows from operating activities that exclude the items described above is a non gaap financial measure  however  we believe this non gaap measure is useful to investors as it better reflects the performance of our core operations  as it is not influenced by certain non recurring expenses 
we are continuing our program to divest of our operations outside of north america 
in february  we sold our operations in argentina and uruguay for net cash proceeds of million 
we currently own funeral businesses in germany and singapore and cemetery businesses in chile  all of which we would consider holding for sale if we believe appropriate values could be obtained  however  these businesses are not currently being held for sale 
we expect these future international asset sales could generate to million of net cash proceeds if and when sold 

table of contents in march  we received a tax refund of million resulting from certain federal tax carry back losses 
total debt at december  was billion 
we currently have about million of debt maturing in and approximately million in we have a credit rating of bb with standard and poor s s p and ba with moody s investors service moody s 
in addition  moody s upgraded sci during to its highest speculative grade liquidity rating of sgl 
we believe these current ratings provide us with adequate access to obtain funds at a reasonable cost  if necessary 
capital allocation considerations we believe that our financial flexibility coupled with our liquidity allows us to consider investments or capital structure related transactions that will enhance shareholder value 
in february  we initiated a quarterly cash dividend of two and one half cents per share of common stock 
while we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future  all subsequent dividends are subject to final determination by the board of directors of sci each quarter after its review of our financial performance 
we intend to continue to buy back our common stock as discussed further below 
we will continue to evaluate internal opportunities such as the construction of new funeral homes and development of high end cemetery property 
we will look at acquisitions that meet the strategic needs of our core business  if such acquisitions are available at reasonable market prices 
these investment decisions will require projected returns at a premium to our weighted average cost of capital 
finally  we could consider additional debt reductions depending on acceptable market conditions 
in august  we announced our initial share repurchase program authorizing the investment of up to million to repurchase our common stock 
in november  we announced the authorization of an additional million 
in february  the authorization was increased by another million for an aggregate of million 
as of march   we had repurchased approximately million shares at a total cost of approximately million under these programs 
we have made and intend to make purchases from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  subject to acceptable market conditions and normal trading restrictions 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to buy our common stock under our share repurchase programs 
important factors that could cause us not to continue to repurchase our shares include  among others  unfavorable market conditions  the market price of our common stock  the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time  and the availability of funds necessary to continue purchasing common stock 
during the third quarter of  we made our first strategic acquisition since for million in cash plus other consideration 
we will continue to look for attractive acquisition opportunities to complement our internal growth initiatives  however  we anticipate only modest activity due to elevated price expectations of potential sellers 
cash flow we believe our ability to generate strong operating cash flow is one of our fundamental financial strengths and provides us with substantial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 
highlights of cash flow for the year ended december  compared to the same period of are as follows operating activities cash flows from operating activities declined by million to million in compared to included in was the payment of million related to the resolution of certain litigation matters  a million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan  and the payment of million to retire life insurance policy loans related to our serp and senior serp retirement programs 
included in was a tax refund of million and disbursements of million net of insurance recoveries related to the resolution of certain litigation matters 
excluding the items described above in both periods  cash flows from operating activities declined million 
cash flows from operating activities that exclude the items described above is a non gaap financial measure  however  we believe this non gaap measure is useful to investors as it provides a consistent basis for comparison between periods and better reflects the performance of our core operations  as it is not influenced by certain non recurring expenses 
a portion of this million decline is attributable to our french business which was divested in march cash flow from operating activities in france declined million from million in to million for the period january  through march  the remaining decline of million is primarily a result of decreases associated with an extra cash payroll payment of million in  the replacement of bonding with trust funding for new preneed sales in florida and working capital increases primarily associated with decreases in accounts receivable collections 
these declines were partially offset by reductions in interest and tax payments 
we incurred an extra bi weekly cash payroll payment of million in that did not occur in this extra bi weekly cash payroll payment occurs every eleven years and is not expected to recur until the year 
table of contents in february  we began making net trust deposits in florida for our new preneed funeral and cemetery sales and discontinued the use of surety bonding as our primary financial assurance mechanism 
net trust deposits to preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service trusts were million for new sales in florida in no trust deposits to preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service trusts were made for new florida sales in  as we used surety bonding in cash interest payments declined million to million in compared to million in the same period of due to significant debt reductions during we did not pay federal income taxes in or because of our significant net operating loss carry forwards and future tax losses anticipated from proposed international asset sales  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes until foreign  state and local income tax payments declined million in to million from million in primarily as a result of less foreign taxes paid due to the disposition of our french operations 
these reductions in interest and tax payments were offset by working capital increases primarily associated with decreases in accounts receivable collections and expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
investing activities cash flows from investing activities improved by million primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sales of international businesses and equity investments described below and net withdrawals from restricted funds primarily related to various commercial commitments described below 
partially offsetting these increases was the payment of million to satisfy a contingent purchase obligation associated with the acquisition of our operations in chile 
capital spending declined million and was offset by million in reduced proceeds from divestitures and sales of property and equipment 
in march  we sold our funeral operations in france 
in addition to maintaining a share of the total equity capital of the newly formed entity  we received net cash proceeds of million 
following a successful public offering transaction of our former united kingdom affiliate during the second quarter of  we liquidated our debt and equity holding in our former united kingdom affiliate and collected million in aggregate of which million is reported as an investing activity and the remaining balance was reported in other income  net in the consolidated statement of operations as of march  in  we made certain restricted cash deposits as a result of our decision to replace certain letters of credit with cash collateral for various commercial commitments primarily surety obligations 
our improved financial condition and credit profile in allowed us to receive million of this cash collateral back 
in early  we received an additional million of cash collateral back and have no further deposits outstanding for cash collateral with surety companies 
financing activities cash used for financing activities increased million and is primarily due to debt extinguishments and stock repurchases 
in  we executed a series of transactions to further strengthen our capital structure 
in april  we successfully completed a private offering of million principal amount of notes due these notes were subsequently exchanged for publicly traded notes and received net cash proceeds of approximately million 
including the premium  million of the net cash proceeds were applied to the early retirement of million in principal of our notes due immediately following the june  conversion into common stock of approximately of our outstanding bonds due  we exercised our option to redeem the remaining outstanding million of the bonds for million in cash  including interest and a premium 
also in  as required by the terms of the agreements  we repaid the remaining million of our notes due april and million of our notes due december with these transactions in  we have significantly extended our debt maturity schedule  reduced our future interest payments and increased our financial flexibility  continuing the progress we have made on improving our balance sheet 
during the period august  to december   we repurchased million shares of common stock for million 
between january and march   we repurchased an additional million shares for million 
as of march   the remaining dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under our share repurchase programs was approximately million 
taxes we had tax receivables of million and long term tax liabilities of million at december  current refundable income taxes and current deferred tax assets are included in other current assets  while long term deferred tax assets are included in deferred charges and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
current taxes payable and current deferred tax liabilities are reflected as income taxes in the consolidated balance sheet and long term tax liabilities are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we maintain accruals for tax liabilities that relate to uncertain tax matters in numerous countries 
if these tax matters are unfavorably resolved  we will make any required payments to tax authorities or adjust the deferred tax asset 
if these 
table of contents tax matters are favorably resolved  the accruals maintained by the company will no longer be required and these amounts will be reversed through the tax provision as a non cash credit at the time of resolution 
debt our financial condition continues to improve as demonstrated by the following trend in our cash and debt balances at december december  in millions total debt cash and cash equivalents total debt less cash and cash equivalents in  we continued to increase our cash balance while simultaneously reducing our total debt 
total debt less cash and cash equivalents or net debt at december  was million  representing the lowest levels in our company since net debt has been reduced by approximately billion or more than since december  this reduction is a result of strong operating cash flows and a successful asset divestiture and joint venture program that produced over million of net cash proceeds 
contractual  commercial and contingent commitments we have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting our business 
we have contractual obligations requiring future cash payments under existing contractual arrangements  such as management  consulting and non competition agreements 
we also have commercial and contingent obligations that result in cash payments only if certain contingent events occur requiring our performance pursuant to a funding commitment 
the following table details our known future cash payments on an undiscounted basis related to various contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total current maturities of long term debt long term debt interest obligation on long term debt casket purchase agreement operating lease agreements management  consulting and non competition agreements total contractual obligations our outstanding indebtedness contains standard provisions  such as payment delinquency default clauses and change of control clauses 
in addition  our bank credit agreement contains a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
we have executed a purchase agreement with a major casket manufacturer for our north america operations with an original minimum commitment of million  covering a six year period  that expired in the agreement contained provisions for annual price adjustments and provided for a one year extension to december  in which we are allowed to satisfy any remaining commitment that exists at the end of the original term 
we elected to extend the contract to december  in order to satisfy its minimum commitment 
in january  we amended our original purchase agreement 
this amendment allows us to continue purchasing caskets through  subject to price increase limitations 
at december   our remaining commitment under the purchase agreement was million 

table of contents the majority of our operating leases contain options to i purchase the property at fair value on the exercise date  ii purchase the property for a value determined at the inception of the leases  or iii renew for the fair rental value at the end of the primary lease term 
our operating leases primarily relate to funeral service locations  automobiles  limousines  hearses  cemetery operating and maintenance equipment and two aircraft 
we have residual value exposures related to certain operating leases of approximately million 
we believe it is unlikely that we will have to make future cash payments related to these residual value exposures 
we have entered into management employment  consulting and non competition agreements which contractually require us to make cash payments over the contractual period 
the agreements have been primarily entered into with certain officers and employees of the company and former owners of businesses acquired 
the contractual obligation amounts pertain to the total commitment outstanding under these agreements and may not be indicative of future expenses to be incurred related to these agreements due to cost rationalization programs completed by the company 
we have not included amounts in this table for payments of pension contributions and payments for various postretirement welfare plans and postemployment benefit plans  as such amounts have not been determined beyond furthermore  we have not presented the amounts associated with these obligations for since we are not required to make any payments to the plans 
the following table details our known potential or possible future cash payments on an undiscounted basis related to various commercial and contingent obligations as of december  dollars in thousands expiration by period commercial and contingent obligations thereafter total surety obligations letters of credit representations and warranties 
total commercial and contingent obligations to support our operations  we have engaged certain surety companies to issue surety bonds on our behalf for customer financial assurance or as required by state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are primarily obtained to provide assurance for our preneed funeral and preneed cemetery obligations  which are appropriately presented as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred preneed funeral contract revenues and deferred cemetery contract revenues 
the total outstanding surety bonds at december  were million 
of this amount  million was related to preneed funeral and preneed cemetery obligations 
when we use surety bonds for preneed funeral and cemetery obligations  the bond amount required is based on the trusting requirements calculated as if the contract was paid in full at the time of sale 
when we deposit funds into state mandated trust funds  however  the amount deposited is generally based on the amount of cash received and payment application rules in the state trust requirements 
therefore  in the event all of the surety companies canceled or did not renew our outstanding surety bonds  which are generally renewed for twelve month periods  we would be required to either obtain replacement assurance or fund approximately million  as of december   primarily into state mandated trust accounts 
at this time  we do not believe we will be required to fund material future amounts related to these surety bonds 
we are occasionally required to post letters of credit  issued by a financial institution  to secure certain insurance programs or other obligations 
letters of credit generally authorize the financial institution to make a payment to the beneficiary upon the satisfaction of a certain event or the failure to satisfy an obligation 
the letters of credit are generally posted for year terms and are usually automatically renewed upon maturity until such time as we have satisfied the commitment secured by the letter of credit 
we are obligated to reimburse the issuer only if the beneficiary collects on the letter of credit 
we believe that it is unlikely we will be required to fund a claim under our outstanding letters of credit 
in  the full amount of the letters of credit was supported by our credit facility which expires august in addition to the letters of credit described above  we currently have contingent obligations of million related to our asset sale and joint venture transactions 
we have agreed to guarantee certain representations and warranties associated with such disposition transactions with letters of credit or interest bearing cash investments 
we have interest bearing cash investments of million included in deferred charges and other assets pledged as collateral for certain of these contingent obligations 
we do not believe we will ultimately be required to fund to third parties claims against these representations and warranties above the carrying value of the liability 
during the year ended december   we agreed to certain representations and warranties associated with the disposition of our funeral operation in france 
the fair value of the representations and warranties associated with the sale was approximately 
table of contents million and included indemnifications related to taxes and other obligations at december  this amount is recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
preneed funeral and cemetery activities in addition to selling our products and services to client families at the time of need  we believe an active funeral and cemetery preneed program  which complements our framework for long term growth  can increase future market share in our service markets 
preneed arrangement is a means through which a customer contractually agrees to the terms of a funeral service  cremation service  and or cemetery burial interment right  merchandise or cemetery service to be performed or provided in the future that is  in advance of when needed or preneed 
preneed funeral activities since preneed funeral services or merchandise will not be provided until some time in the future  most states and provinces require that all or a portion of the funds collected from customers on preneed funeral contracts be protected for the benefit of the customer pursuant to applicable law 
some or all of the funds may be required to be placed into trust accounts  or a surety bond may be posted in lieu of trusting collectively trust funded preneed funeral contracts 
alternatively  where allowed  customers may choose to purchase a life insurance or annuity policy from third party insurance companies to fund their preneed funeral insurance funded preneed funeral contract 
only certain of these customer funding options may be applicable in any given market we serve 
the contract amounts associated with unfulfilled insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
however  when customers enter into a trust funded preneed contract  we record an asset  preneed funeral receivables and trust investments and a corresponding obligation  deferred preneed funeral revenues in our consolidated balance sheet for the contract price 
the preneed funeral receivable is then decreased by the cash received from the customer at the time of sale 
the funeral revenues are deferred and will not be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations until the funeral services are performed or the merchandise is delivered 
when we receive payments on a trust funded preneed funeral contract from the customer  we deposit the amount required by law into the trust and reclass the corresponding amount from deferred preneed funeral revenues into non controlling interest in funeral and cemetery trusts 
while some customers may pay for their contract in a single payment  most preneed funerals are sold on an installment basis over a period of one to seven years 
on these installment contracts  we receive  on average  a down payment at the time of sale of approximately 
historically  the majority of our preneed funeral trust contracts have not included a finance charge 
however  we began test marketing of a finance charge program for preneed funeral trust contracts during the fourth quarter of we may plan a phased rollout during to the states where such finance charges are allowed 
trust funded preneed funeral contracts where the applicable law requires that all or a portion of the funds collected from preneed funeral contracts be placed in trust accounts  the funds deposited into trust are invested by the independent trustees in accordance with the investment guidelines established by statute or  where the prudent investor rule is applicable  the guidelines established by our investment committee 
the trustees utilize professional investment advisors to select and monitor the money managers that make the individual investment decisions in accordance with the guidelines 
we retain any funds above the amounts required to be deposited into trust accounts and use them for working capital purposes  generally to offset the selling and administrative costs of the preneed programs 
applicable law governs the timing of the required deposits into the trust accounts  which generally ranges from five to days after receipt of the funds from the customer 
the trust investments are expected to generate earnings sufficient to offset the inflationary costs of providing the preneed funeral services and merchandise in the future for the prices that were guaranteed at the time of sale 
as a result of the adoption of fin r  the preneed funeral trust assets have been consolidated and are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at market value in accordance with sfas investment earnings on trust assets are generally accumulated in the trust and distributed as each preneed contract is either utilized upon the death of  or cancelled by  the customer 
however  in certain states  the trusts are allowed to distribute a portion of the investment earnings to us prior to that date 
see the critical accounting policies and accounting changes of item of this form k for additional information regarding the implementation of fin r 
direct selling costs which consist of direct compensation costs and related payroll expenses directly attributable to selling preneed funeral trust funded contracts incurred pursuant to the sales of trust funded preneed funeral contracts are deferred and included in deferred charges and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred selling costs are expensed in proportion to the corresponding trust funded preneed funeral contract revenues when recognized 
other selling costs associated with the sales and marketing of preneed funeral contracts eg  lead procurements costs  brochures and marketing materials  advertising and administrative costs are expensed as incurred 
an allowance for cancellation is recorded for trust funded preneed funeral contract deferred selling costs based on historical contract cancellation experience 

table of contents if a customer cancels the trust funded preneed funeral contract  applicable law determines the amount of the refund owed to the customer  including in certain situations the amount of the attributed investment earnings 
upon cancellation  we receive the amount of principal deposited to trust and previously undistributed net investment earnings and pay the customer the required refund 
we retain any excess funds and recognize the amounts as funeral revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
in certain jurisdictions  we may be obligated to fund any shortfall if the amounts deposited by the customer exceed the funds in trust 
as a result  when realized or unrealized losses of a trust result in trust funded preneed funeral contracts being under funded  we will assess those contracts to determine whether a loss provision should be recorded 
we have not been required to recognize any loss amounts at december   or the cash flow activity over the life of a trust funded preneed funeral contract from the date of sale to its death maturity or cancellation is captured in the line item net effect of preneed funeral production and maturities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
while the contract is outstanding  cash flow is provided by the amount retained from funds collected from the customer and any distributed investment earnings 
this is reduced by the payment of trust funded preneed funeral deferred selling costs 
the effect of amortizing trust funded preneed funeral deferred selling costs is reflected in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
at the time of death maturity  we receive the principal and undistributed investment earnings from the trust and any remaining receivable due from the customer 
this cash flow at the time of service is generally less than the revenue recognized  thus creating a negative effect on working capital cash flow from operating activities 
in certain situations pursuant to applicable laws  we can post a surety bond as financial assurance for an amount that would otherwise be required to be deposited in trust accounts for trust funded preneed funeral contracts 
see the financial assurances section within this preneed funeral and cemetery activities section for further details on our practice of posting such surety bonds 
we believe the deferred revenues associated with preneed funeral bonded contracts exceed the expected cost of meeting our obligations to provide funeral services and merchandise for the outstanding preneed funeral bonded contracts  and our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to fulfill these contracts without use of the surety bonds 
if the expected costs were to exceed the deferred revenues  we would be required to record a loss provision in our consolidated statement of operations 
if a customer cancels the trust funded preneed funeral contract that has been bonded prior to death maturity  applicable law determines the amount of the refund owed to the customer 
because the funds have not been held in trust  there are no earnings to be refunded to the customer or us 
we pay the customer refund out of our operating funds  which reduces working capital cash flow from operating activities 
the cash flow activity over the life of a preneed funeral contract that has been bonded from the date of sale to its death maturity or cancellation is captured in the line item net effect of preneed funeral production and maturities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the payments received from our customers for their trust funded preneed funeral contracts that have been bonded are a source of working capital cash flow from operating activities until the contracts mature 
this is reduced by the payment of deferred selling costs  the premiums to the surety companies for the bond coverage  and refunds on customer cancellations of contracts 
when a trust funded preneed funeral contract that has been bonded matures upon the death of the beneficiary  there is no additional cash flow to us unless the customer owed an outstanding balance  thus creating a negative effect on the cash flow from operating activities 
insurance funded preneed funeral contracts where permitted  customers arrange their funeral contract by purchasing a life insurance or annuity policy from third party insurance companies  for which we earn a commission for being the general agent for the insurance company 
the policy amount of the insurance contract between the customer and the third party insurance company generally equals the amount of the preneed funeral contract 
however  we do not reflect the unfulfilled insurance funded preneed funeral contract amounts in our consolidated balance sheet 
the third party insurance company collects funds related to the insurance contract directly from the customer 
the life insurance contracts include increasing death benefit provisions  which are expected to offset the inflationary costs of providing the preneed funeral services and merchandise in the future for the prices that were guaranteed at the time of the preneed sale 
increasing insurance benefits or death benefits payable by third party insurance companies increase annually pursuant to the terms of the life insurance policies purchased in advance of need by our customers to fund their funerals 
the customer policy holder assigns the policy benefits to our funeral home to pay for the preneed funeral contract at the time of need 
approximately of our north america preneed funeral production is insurance funded preneed funeral contracts 

table of contents we receive general agency commissions from third party insurance companies when customers purchase insurance contracts from such third party insurance companies to fund funeral services and merchandise at a future date 
these general agency commissions are based on a percentage per contract sold and are recognized as funeral revenues when the insurance purchase transaction between the customer and third party insurance provider is completed 
direct selling costs incurred pursuant to the sale of insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are expensed as incurred 
additionally  we may receive cash overrides based on achieving certain dollar volume targets of life insurance policies sold as a result of marketing agreements entered into in connection with the sale of our insurance subsidiaries in these overrides are recorded in other income  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
if a customer cancels the insurance funded preneed funeral contract prior to death maturity  the insurance company pays the cash surrender value under the insurance policy directly to the customer 
if the contract was outstanding for less than one year  the insurance company charges back the ga revenues and overrides we received on the contract 
an allowance for these chargebacks is included in the consolidated balance sheet based on our historical chargeback experience 
because insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet  the cash flow activity associated with these contracts generally occurs only at the time of sale and at death maturity or cancellation and is recorded as cash flows from operating activities within our funeral segment 
at the time of sale  the ga revenues and overrides received net of the direct selling costs provide a net source of cash flow 
if the insurance contract cancels within one year following the date of sale  our cash flow is reduced by the chargeback of ga revenues and overrides 
at death maturity  the insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are included in funeral trade accounts receivable and funeral revenues when the funeral service is performed 
proceeds from the life insurance policies are used to satisfy the receivables due 
the insurance proceeds which include the increasing death benefit less the funds used to provide the funeral goods and services provide a net source of cash flow

the decline in ga revenue is a result of a shift in product mix from whole life policies to flex insurance policies  for which we earn a lower commission rate 
the increase in direct expenses is the result of higher fringe benefits expenses and shifts in the product mix by counselor between trust and insurance

insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not included in the consolidated balance sheet 
the backlog of trust funded deferred preneed funeral revenues and the associated assets decreased due to the adjustments from the trust reconciliation project and the removal of certain third party executory contracts 
see further discussion of the trust reconciliation project in restatement of financial statements of item of this form k 
preneed cemetery activities when purchasing cemetery property interment rights  merchandise  and services on a preneed basis  approximately of our consumers choose to pay the entire amount of the contract at the time of sale 
the remaining customers choose to pay for their contracts on an installment basis generally over a period of one to seven years 
on these installment contracts  we receive an average down payment at the time of sale of approximately 
historically  the installment contracts have included a finance charge ranging from to depending on the date sold  the payment period selected  state laws and the payment method ie  monthly statement billing or automated bank draft 
unlike trust funded preneed funeral contracts  where the entire purchase price is deferred and the revenue is recognized as one event at the time of death maturity  the revenues associated with a preneed cemetery contract can be recognized as different contract events occur 
preneed sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property are recognized when a minimum of of the sales price has been collected and the property has been constructed or is available for interment 
with the customer s direction  which is generally obtained at the time of sale  we can choose to order  store  and transfer title to the customer of their personalized marker merchandise 
upon the earlier of vendor storage of these items or delivery in our cemetery  we recognize the associated revenues and record the cost of sale 
for services  personalized marker merchandise where the customer chooses not to elect vendor storage or early delivery to our cemetery  and non personalized merchandise such as vaults  we defer the revenues until the services are performed and the merchandise is delivered 
because the services or merchandise will not be provided until some time in the future  all or a portion of the proceeds from the sale of preneed cemetery merchandise and services may be required by law to be paid into merchandise and services trusts until the merchandise is delivered or the service is provided

we have not been required to recognize any loss amounts at december  or as the preneed cemetery contract merchandise and service items for which we were required to deposit funds to trust are delivered and recognized as revenues  we receive the principal and previously undistributed investment earnings from the trust 
there is generally no remaining receivable due from the customer  as our policy is to deliver preneed cemetery merchandise and service items only upon payment of the contract balance in full

financial assurances in support of operations  we have entered into arrangements with certain surety companies whereby such companies agree to issue surety bonds on our behalf as financial assurance and or as required by existing state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are used for various business purposes  however  the majority of the surety bonds issued and outstanding have been used to support our

the underlying obligations these surety bonds assure are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as deferred preneed funeral revenues and deferred preneed cemetery revenues 
the breakdown of surety bonds between funeral and cemetery preneed arrangements  as well as surety bonds for other activities are described below 
the increase in preneed funeral surety bonds is primarily a result of the annual review performed in florida during the first quarter of this review adjusted the bonds to cover the liabilities associated with sales during we expect this number to decline in subsequent years as merchandise and services related to such bonded contracts are delivered or performed see further discussion related to florida bonding below

we post the surety bonds in lieu of trusting a certain amount of funds received from the customer 
the amount of the bond posted is generally determined by the total amount of the preneed contract that would otherwise be required to be trusted  in accordance with applicable state law 
for the twelve months ended december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of cash receipts attributable to bonded sales 
these amounts do not consider reductions associated with taxes  obtaining costs  or other costs 
surety bond premiums are paid annually and are automatically renewable until maturity of the underlying preneed contracts  unless we are given prior notice of cancellation 
except for cemetery preconstruction bonds which are irrevocable  the surety companies generally have the right to cancel the surety bonds at any time with appropriate notice 
in the event a surety company was to cancel the surety bond  we are required to obtain replacement surety assurance from another surety company or fund a trust for an amount generally less than the posted bond amount 
management does not expect it will be required to fund material future amounts related to these surety bonds because of lack of surety capacity 
the applicable florida law that allows posting of surety bonds for preneed contracts expired december   however  it allowed for preneed contracts entered into prior to december  to continue to be bonded for the remaining life of those contracts 
of the total cash receipts attributable to bonded sales for the twelve months ended december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  were attributable to the state of florida 
on february   we elected to begin trusting as a financial assurance mechanism in florida  rather than surety bonding  on new florida sales of preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services 
our net trust deposits required in for these eleven months of new florida sales were million 
no trust deposits were made for new florida sales in  as we used surety bonding for those sales

failure to execute any or all of the strategic plan could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
our indebtedness limits funds available for our operations 
as of december   we had approximately billion in indebtedness 
our indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional financing and require the dedication of more cash flow to service our debt than we desire 
furthermore  it may require the sale of assets or limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our markets 
our ability to satisfy our indebtedness in a timely manner will be dependent on the successful execution of our long term business plan and the resulting improvements in our operating performance 
our existing credit agreements and indentures contain covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions 
our existing credit agreements and indentures contain  among other things  various affirmative and negative covenants that may prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us 
these covenants limit  among other things  our and our subsidiaries ability to borrow money  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  and consummate certain liens on assets 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests 
during  we executed a bank credit agreement replacing the previous agreement due to expire july the new bank credit facility provides us with greater flexibility in terms of acquisitions  dividends  and share repurchases 
see note eleven to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information related to our bank credit facility 
if we lost the ability to use surety bonding to support our preneed funeral and preneed cemetery activities  we could have to make material cash payments to fund certain trust funds 
we have entered into arrangements with certain surety companies whereby such companies agree to issue surety bonds on our behalf as financial assurance and or as required by existing state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are used for various business purposes  however  the majority of the surety bonds issued and outstanding have been issued to support our preneed funeral and cemetery activities 
in the event all of the surety companies cancelled or did not renew our surety bonds  which are generally renewed for twelve month periods  we would be required to either obtain replacement coverage or fund approximately million as of december  into state mandated trust accounts 
at this time  we do not believe we will be required to fund material future amounts related to these surety bonds 
the funeral home and cemetery industry is becoming increasingly competitive 
in north america and most international markets in which we operate  the funeral and cemetery industry is characterized by a large number of locally owned  independent operations 
to compete successfully  our funeral service locations and cemeteries must maintain good reputations and high professional standards in the industry  as well as offer attractive products and services at competitive prices 
in addition  we must market our company in such a manner as to distinguish us from our competitors 
if we are unable to successfully compete  our company  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our affiliated funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds  which are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond our control 
in connection with our preneed funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise and service sales  most affiliated funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds 
our earnings and investment gains and losses on these equity securities and mutual funds are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond our control 
if our earnings from our trust funds decline  we would likely experience a decline in future revenues 
in addition  if the trust funds experienced significant 
table of contents investment losses  there would likely be insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the costs of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
we would have to cover any such shortfall with cash flows  which could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
as of december   net unrealized appreciation in the preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust funds amounted to million and million  respectively 
the perpetual care trust funds had net unrealized appreciation of million as of december  the following table summarizes the investment returns excluding fees on our trust funds for the last three years 
preneed funeral trust funds cemetery merchandise services trust funds perpetual care trust funds increasing insurance benefits related to preneed funeral contracts funded through life insurance or annuity contracts may not cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service 
we sell price guaranteed preneed funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
for preneed funeral contracts funded through life insurance or annuity contracts  we receive in cash a general agency commission that typically ranges between and of the total sale from the third party insurance company 
additionally  there is an increasing insurance benefit associated with the contract of approximately per year to be received in cash by us at the time the funeral is performed 
there is no guarantee that the increasing insurance benefit will cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service  which could materially adversely affect our future cash flows  revenues and profit margins 
unfavorable results of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 
as discussed in note fourteen  we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits 
adverse outcomes in some or all of the pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
while management currently believes that resolving all of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations  the litigation and other claims noted above are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future 
there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
if the number of deaths in our markets declines  our cash flows and revenues may decrease 
the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase up to one percent per year from to however  longer life spans could reduce the number of deaths during this period 
if the number of deaths declines  the number of funeral services and interments performed by us could decrease and our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
the continuing upward trend in the number of cremations performed in north america could result in lower revenue and gross profit dollars 
in the death care industry  there has been a growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america as an alternative to traditional funeral service dispositions 
in north america during  of the comparable funeral services performed by us were cremation cases compared to and performed in and  respectively 
we continue to expand our cremation memorialization products and services  which has resulted in higher average sales for cremation services 
if we are unable to successfully expand our cremation memorialization products and services to meet the continuing trends  our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the funeral home and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses 
the majority of our operations throughout the world are managed in groups called markets 
markets are geographical groups of funeral service locations and cemeteries that share common resources such as operating personnel  preparation services  clerical staff  motor vehicles and preneed sales personnel 
personnel costs  the largest of our operating expenses  are the cost components most beneficially affected by this grouping 
we must incur many of these costs regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot necessarily decrease these costs when we experience lower sales volumes  the sales decline may cause margin percentages to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
the funeral home and cemetery industry is highly regulated 
our operations are subject to regulation  supervision  and licensing under numerous foreign  federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  including extensive regulations concerning trust funds  preneed sales of funeral and cemetery products and services  and various other aspects of our business 
the impact of such regulations varies depending on the location of our funeral and cemetery operations 
violations of applicable laws could result in fines or their sanctions to us 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which would increase costs and decrease cash flows 
for example  foreign  federal  state  local and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
some states and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not be able to joint venture or sell our international operations on acceptable terms or at all 
our long term strategic plan includes the joint venture or sale of our remaining international operations outside of north america in order to create cash proceeds to reduce debt 
subsequent to december   we completed the disposition of our operations in argentina and uruguay 
however  if we are unable to joint venture or sell our remaining international operations on acceptable terms or otherwise  it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic plan 
our foreign operations and investments involve special risks 
our activities in areas outside the united states are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations  including the following loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  nationalization  wars  insurrection and other political risks  the effects of currency fluctuations and exchange controls  such as devaluation of foreign currencies and other economic problems  and changes in laws  regulations  and policies of foreign governments  including those associated with changes in the governing parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes twelve and thirteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
we have historically used derivatives primarily in the form of interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps  and forward exchange contracts in combination with local currency borrowings in order to manage our mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to hedge our net investment in foreign assets 
we generally do not participate in derivative transactions that are leveraged or considered speculative in nature 
we were not a party to any derivative transactions at december  or none of our market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes 
all of the instruments described below are entered into for other than trading purposes 
at december  and  of our total debt consisted of fixed rate debt at a weighted average rate of and  respectively 

table of contents at december   approximately of our net investment and of our operating income excluding gains and impairment losses on dispositions  net  and other operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 
approximately of our net investment and of our operating income  excluding gains impairment losses on dispositions  net  and other operating expenses  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  at december  we do not have a significant investment in foreign operations that are in highly inflationary economies 
marketable equity and debt securities price risk in connection with our preneed funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise and service sales  the related funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds  which are sensitive to current market prices 
cost and market values as of december  are presented in notes five  six and seven to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
market rate sensitive instruments interest rate and currency risk we perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of interest rate and exchange rate risks on earnings 
this analysis determines the effect of a hypothetical adverse change in market rates 
in actuality  market rate volatility is dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast 
therefore  the adverse changes described below could differ substantially from the hypothetical change 
a sensitivity analysis of debt instruments with variable interest rate components was modeled to assess the impact that changing interest rates could have on pretax earnings 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous adverse change to the then prevailing interest rates with all other variables held constant 
given this model  our pretax earnings  on an annual basis  would not change at either december  or because of our debt is fixed rate 
the fair market value of our debt was approximately million more than its carrying value at december  a similar model was used to assess the impact of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies on interest expense 
at december  and  our debt exposure was primarily associated with the chilean peso and the euro  respectively 
a adverse change in the strength of the us dollar would have negatively affected our interest expense  on an annual basis  by less than million on december  and by approximately million on december
