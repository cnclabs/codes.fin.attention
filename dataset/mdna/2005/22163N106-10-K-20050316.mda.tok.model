item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading supplier of retailer brand carbonated soft drinks in the us  canada and the us our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december each year 
as a result  a rd week is included in our fiscal year every five or six years 
our prior fiscal year  which ended january   consisted of weeks 
for the purpose of the discussion below  our fiscal years that ended january   january  and december  are referred to respectively as  and sales for were  million up from  million in strong performance was recorded in all business units except canada  which was down excluding the impact of foreign exchange 
gross margin was for as compared to in higher plant costs  resulting primarily from inefficiencies in the us operations and increases in freight and packaging costs contributed to this decline 
in the fourth quarter the gross margin was compared to for the fourth quarter last year 
inventory write offs and lower plant efficiencies adversely impacted the fourth quarter 
supplier rebates  partially offset by packaging price increases  had a favorable impact of approximately basis points on fourth quarter gross margin 
income from continuing operations in was million or per diluted share  compared with reported income from continuing operations of million or per diluted share in the aggregate cost of our acquisitions in was million 
in  we completed the acquisition of certain of the assets of the cardinal companies of elizabethtown  llc cardinal and certain of the assets of metro beverage co 
metro which added production capacity to our beverage system 
versus results of operations sales sales in were  million  an increase of from  million in the extra week in added million in sales that year 
excluding the impact of the extra week in  sales increased in in december  we acquired the retailer brand beverage business of quality beverage brands  llc located in north carolina and in  we acquired certain of the assets of cardinal and metro 
these acquisitions added million or  in the aggregate  to sales in when the impact of these acquisitions and foreign exchange are also excluded  sales increased and  respectively 
total case volume in ounce equivalents for was  million  up from  million in in the us  our sales were  million in  an increase of from or excluding the extra week in when also excluding acquisitions  sales increased from the growth was driven by increased volume with existing customers  introduction of new products and sales to new customers 
in canada  our sales were million in  a decrease of in from million in however  when the impact of foreign exchange rates is excluded  sales in canada were down from this decrease reflected the overall weak demand for carbonated soft drinks in grocery stores 
in the uk and europe  our sales were million in  an increase of from million in excluding the impact of the strengthened pound sterling  sales increased in the increase was due to continued focus on core products  manufacturing for non retailer third parties  partnering with key suppliers  optimizing manufacturing processes and warehouse logistics and introducing new products 
the international segment includes the mexican operations  the royal crown international division and our business in asia 
sales by this segment were million in  an increase of when compared with sales of million in excluding foreign exchange  sales increased 
the increase in sales is primarily due to sales in mexico where sales were million  an increase of from million in gross profit gross profit was of sales for compared with in lower margins resulted primarily from reduced plant efficiencies and higher logistics costs as we struggled to meet increased demand during the first half of higher commodity costs including resin for pet bottles and aluminum for cans were largely offset by price increases charged to our customers 
variable costs represented of total cost of sales in major elements of these variable costs included ingredient and packaging costs  fees paid to third party manufacturers and distribution costs 
in the us  approximately of our beverages are manufactured in facilities that we or third party manufacturers  with whom we have long term co packing agreements  either own or lease 
we manufacture virtually all of our canadian beverages and all of our uk and mexican beverages in facilities that we either own or lease 
these proportions have remained substantially unchanged during the past few years 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a was million in  an increase of million or from million in increases in sg a include costs associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance  provisions taken during the year to write off certain export receivables in canada  adding new employees  principally to serve our growing us business  and a negative impact from the weakened us dollar 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation 
unusual items unusual items of million in and million in are primarily due to write downs we took relating to our investment in the iroquois water ltd 
business 
at january   the net book value of our iroquois water investment is million 
interest expense net interest expense was million in  down from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings on our credit facilities during the year 
income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in reflecting an effective tax rate of 
this decreased from million  or an effective rate of  in primarily due to a change in management s estimate to the reserve 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition cash provided by operating activities in was million  after capital expenditures of million  as compared to in which cash provided by operating activities was million  after capital expenditures of million 
while capital expenditures increased by million  the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by increased accounts receivable and inventory 
the increase in accounts receivable was mainly due to supplier rebates paid in january and an increase in income taxes receivable due to a lower than expected income tax liability 
inventory levels were adversely impacted by plant inefficiencies and poor forecasting by our us division 
investing activities in march  we acquired certain of the assets of cardinal 
the acquisition is expected to add million a year annually in carbonated soft drink sales and additional manufacturing capacity to support our growing demand for retailer branded beverages in the us the total purchase price was million and was funded from cash flow from operations and short term borrowings 
in october  we purchased certain of the assets of metro to increase production capacity in the us the total purchase price was million and was funded from cash flow from operations and short term borrowings 
the total cost of these acquisitions in was million including acquisition costs of million 
in addition  we purchased the plant and equipment of elan waters in blairsville  georgia for million to add to our production capacity in the us the purchase was funded from short term borrowings 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million in as compared with million in major capital expenditures include million on manufacturing equipment and plates and film  primarily in the us  to meet the needs of our growing business in that market 
we commenced construction on a new beverage manufacturing facility in dallas fort worth  texas 
we currently anticipate the plant will be operational in and ready for full production in capital resources and long term debt our sources of capital include operating cash flows  short term borrowings under current credit facilities  issuance of public debt and issuance of equity securities 
management believes we have adequate financial resources to meet our ongoing cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures  as well as our other financial obligations based on our operating cash flows and current available credit 
we have a committed senior secured credit facility in the us and canada 
the credit facility terminates  and the debt under that agreement is due  on december  that facility allows for revolving credit borrowings in a principal amount of up to million 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at base rate plus per annum or libor plus per annum 
a facility fee of per annum is payable on the entire line of credit 
as of january   the outstanding amount of revolving credit loans was million 
we and our wholly owned subsidiary  cott beverages inc  are co borrowers on the facility  but the debt is guaranteed by most of our us and canadian subsidiaries 
the debt and guarantees are secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the guarantors 
we are currently in the process of negotiating a replacement for this facility 
we expect alternative sources of financing to be in place toward the end of the first quarter of we also have outstanding senior subordinated notes  which are due in as of january   the principal amount of those notes was million 
the issuer of the notes is cott beverages inc  but the notes are guaranteed by us and most of our us and canadian subsidiaries 
we also had a million pound million demand bank credit facility in the uk  with million outstanding as of january  this credit facility expired on december  as we are currently negotiating a new worldwide facility 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at prime plus per annum or libor plus per annum except for us dollar borrowings  which currently bear interest at the short term offered rate plus per annum 
the margin on us dollar borrowings can be changed up to on one month s notice 
as of january   only us dollar borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility at an interest rate of 
our current credit facilities provide maximum credit of million 
at january   after million of standby letters of credit  million of the senior secured credit facility in the us and canada and million of the uk credit facility in the uk were available 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was as of january  long term debt as of january  was million  compared with million at the end of long term debt in and consisted primarily of senior subordinated notes with a stated face value of million 
our senior secured credit facility and the indenture respecting the notes contain a number of business and financial covenants and events of default that apply to the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries 
the restricted subsidiaries are  in general  the guarantor subsidiaries organized in canada and the us among other events of default or triggers for prepayment in our credit facilities and indenture are a change of control of us in certain circumstances  cross default or cross acceleration to other indebtedness in excess of million  unsatisfied judgments in excess of million  our insolvency or that of the restricted subsidiaries  and covenant default under the indenture or credit facilities 
some of the more material business and financial covenants are discussed below 
our senior secured credit facility restricts additional indebtedness for subsidiaries to the existing debt and credit facilities  certain intercompany debt  million of subordinated debt to unrestricted subsidiaries  million of purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations  million of guarantee obligations and a million basket of other additional indebtedness 
the senior secured credit facility contains restrictions on investments including investments in subsidiaries outside of the us or canada and acquisitions 
in general  individual acquisitions are permitted up to million with the aggregate expenditure for all acquisitions limited to million in any fiscal year 
there is also a restriction on disposition of assets having a fair market value exceeding million in a fiscal year with certain specified exemptions 
restricted payments such as dividends or capital stock purchases are currently limited to of consolidated net income but that amount drops to of consolidated net income if the leverage ratio exceeds to capital expenditures in the us and canada are limited  in the aggregate  to million plus a carryforward of the unused current permitted capital expenditures from the prior year 
there are further restrictions in several of the covenants  such as a complete prohibition on paying any dividends  if we are in default under the senior secured credit agreement 
in addition  many of the covenants effectively limit transactions with our unrestricted subsidiaries or non guarantor entities 
finally  there are additional business covenants in our uk credit facility  but the amounts committed for borrowing under those facilities are immaterial in amount and  therefore  those covenants are not material to our operations 
in addition to business covenants  there are financial covenants in our senior secured credit facility 
since the third quarter of  our leverage ratio was required to be no more than to and that requirement is tightened to to in the second quarter of at the end of  our leverage ratio was to the senior secured credit facility also has an interest coverage test and a fixed charge test 
during  our interest coverage ratio was required to be at least to and by the fourth quarter of it must be at least to as of january  it was to our fixed charge coverage ratio had to be at least to at the end of at january   our fixed charge coverage ratio was to the indenture for the notes also has numerous covenants that are applicable to cott beverages inc  us and the restricted subsidiaries 
we can only make restricted payments  such as paying dividends  buying back stock or making certain investments  if our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least to even then  we can only make those restricted payments in an amount that is no greater than of our consolidated net income subject to certain adjustments 
certain other investments  like those not exceeding million in the aggregate  may be made without satisfying the restricted payments test 
we can only incur additional debt or issue preferred stock  other than certain specified debt  if our fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than to for purposes of the indenture  our fixed charge coverage ratio was to as of january  subject to some exceptions  asset sales may only be made where the sale price is equal to the fair market value of the asset sold and we receive at least of the proceeds in cash 
there are also limitations on what we may do with the sale proceeds such that we may be required to pay down debt or reinvest the proceeds in enumerated business uses within a specified period of time 
there are further restrictions in several of the covenants  such as a complete prohibition on paying any dividends  if we are in default under the indenture 
many of the covenants also effectively limit transactions with our unrestricted subsidiaries or non guarantor entities 
several of the terms  like restricted payments  are defined differently in the indenture and the senior secured credit facility and certain calculations are made differently in the two agreements 
there are also certain financial covenants in our uk facility  but the amounts committed for borrowing under that facility are immaterial in amount and  therefore  those financial covenants are not material to our operations 
we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility under the terms of our indebtedness to operate our business as currently planned 
capital structure in  shareowner s equity increased by million from net income of million  additional share capital of million from the exercise of employee stock options  including the related tax benefit  million in favorable foreign currency translation on the net assets of self sustaining foreign operations and a reduction of million in unrealized losses on cash flow hedges all contributed to the net increase 
the foreign currency translation adjustment resulted from the strengthening of the pound sterling and the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
dividend payments no dividends were paid in and we are not expecting to change this policy in as we intend to use cash for future growth or debt repayment 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends under our credit facility and notes indenture 
the most restrictive provision is the quarterly limitation of dividends based on the prior quarter s earnings 
we currently can pay dividends subject to these limitations 
contractual obligations the following chart shows the schedule of future payments under certain contracts  including debt agreements and guarantees as of january  payments due by period contractual obligations in millions total less than year years years after years notes operating leases capital lease purchase obligations purchase obligations consist of an information technology outsourcing contract  contracts with certain co packers and commitments for the purchase of inventory and capital expenditures 
these obligations represent expected expenditures under the normal course of business  not our minimum contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on historical experience  the advice of external experts or on other assumptions management believes to be reasonable 
where actuals differ from estimates  revisions are included in the results of the period in which actuals become known 
historically  differences between estimates and actuals have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements are discussed with our audit committee as they are implemented and on an annual basis and include the following revenue recognition we report sales when ownership passes to customers for products manufactured in our own plants and or by third parties on our behalf 
we regularly evaluate the facts and circumstances in relation to the criteria in the eitf and use our best judgment to determine whether to report sales on a gross or net basis for products manufactured by third parties 
currently  the facts and circumstances surrounding all of our business support the reporting of all sales on a gross basis 
we offer sales incentives to certain customers 
we account for these incentives as a reduction from sales 
we follow the guidance under eitf in accounting for sales incentives 
where the incentive has been paid in advance  we amortize the amount based on expected future sales related to the incentive 
where the incentive is to be paid in arrears  we accrue the amount based on expected future sales related to the incentive 
impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard sfas in  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are no longer amortized  but instead are tested at least annually for impairment 
any impairment loss is recognized in income 
we have goodwill of million and rights of million on our balance sheet at january  in accordance with sfas  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis 
the evaluation of goodwill for each reporting unit is based upon the following approach 
we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
where the carrying value is greater than the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any of the remainder being allocated to goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine the impairment loss 
we measure the fair value of reporting units using discounted future cash flow 
because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity  the discounted future cash flow includes a terminal value 
the long term growth assumptions incorporated into the discounted cash flow calculation reflect our long term view of the market and the discount rate is based on our weighted average cost of capital 
each year we re evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment 
based on the evaluation performed this year  we determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and that as a result the second step of the impairment test was not required 
our only intangible asset with an indefinite life relates to our acquisition of intellectual property from royal crown company  inc including the right to manufacture our concentrates  with all related inventions  processes  technologies  technical and manufacturing information and know how 
there is an indefinite life to our ownership of these rights  and there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic  or other factors that limit the useful life 
in accordance with sfas  based on the above factors  the life of the rights is considered to be indefinite and they are not amortized  but are tested annually for impairment 
impairment of an intangible asset with an indefinite life  if any  is determined using the same discounted future cash flow assumptions and model discussed above for goodwill 
we compare the carrying value of the rights to their fair value and recognize in income any impairment in value 
other intangible assets other intangible assets consist principally of customer relationships that arise from acquisitions which amounted to million at january  customer relationships are amortized on a straight line basis for the period over which we expect to receive economic benefits 
we periodically compare the carrying value of customer relationships by customer to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related customers and recognize any impairment in our income statement 
the expected life and value of these intangible assets is based on an evaluation of the competitive environment  customer history and future prospects as appropriate 
income taxes we regularly review the recognized and unrecognized deferred income tax assets to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is required 
management believes that virtually all deferred tax assets will be realized as a result of anticipated future taxable income from operations 
deferred tax assets of million relate primarily to canada and a significant change in the volumes or profitability of these operations could affect the realization of the deferred tax assets 
canadian gaap we make available to all shareowners consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting practices gaap and file these financial statements with canadian regulatory authorities 
results reported under canadian gaap may differ from results reported under us gaap from time to time 
under canadian gaap in  we reported net income of million and total assets of  million compared to net income and total assets reported under us gaap of million and  million  respectively 
there is one material us canadian gaap difference in under canadian gaap  effective january   stock options issued to employees subsequent to january  are recognized in net income based on their fair value 
as a result  compensation expense of million  million net of tax of million  was recorded during the year 
this policy was adopted on a retroactive basis with no restatement of comparative figures and as a result million was charged to opening retained earnings as at january  under us gaap  we have elected not to record compensation expense for options issued to employees with an exercise price equal to the market value of the options 
under canadian gaap in  we reported net income of million and total assets of million compared to net income and total assets reported under us gaap of million and million  respectively 
there were no material us canadian gaap differences for versus results of operations sales sales in were  million  an increase of from  million in excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and the acquisitions of premium beverage packers  inc wyomissing and cott embotelladores de mexico  sa de sa cemsa  our sales increased 
the additional week in added million dollars in sales 
when the extra week of sales is also excluded  our sales were up in as described in detail by business segment below 
total ounce case equivalent volume was  million cases in excluding the impact of acquisitions and concentrate sales  volume was million equivalent cases  up compared to the prior year 
in the us  our sales were  million in  an increase of from the wyomissing acquisition occurred in june and added million to sales for the first half of excluding this acquisition  sales were up 
the growth was driven by increased volume with existing customers and the introduction of new products 
in canada  our sales were million in  an increase of in from million in however  when the impact of foreign exchange rates is excluded  sales in canada were down 
this decrease reflected the difficult competitive environment in the carbonated soft drink industry in canada 
in the uk and europe  our sales were million in  an increase of from million in excluding the impact of the strengthened pound sterling  sales increased in new business accounted for about half of the increase and the remaining increase was due to improved service levels with existing customers and warmer than normal summer temperatures 
the international segment includes the mexican operations  the royal crown international division and our business in asia 
sales by this segment were million in  an increase of when compared with sales of million in excluding the carry over impact of the acquisitions made in  sales were up 
sales for the mexican operation were million  an increase of million when compared to and accounted for of the increase in our international sales 
the remainder of the increase was due to increased promotional activities by royal crown international 
gross profit gross profit was of sales for compared with in higher margins resulted primarily from improved productivity and larger economies of scale  particularly in the uk this margin improvement was partially offset by approximately million of additional distribution costs incurred in the us during the busy summer season 
variable costs represented of total cost of sales in major elements of these variable costs included ingredients and packaging costs  fees paid to third party manufacturers  and distribution costs 
about of our beverage products are manufactured in facilities we own or lease  or by third party manufacturers with whom we have long term co packing agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a was million in  up from million for approximately one third of the increase was due to foreign exchange rate impacts in the uk and canadian business segments  of the increase was due to costs associated with the wyomissing us and mexico acquisitions and the remaining amount was due to an increase in the number of employees necessary to meet the needs of our growing business 
as a percentage of sales  sg a declined to in from in unusual items the unusual items of million in includes a provision for a note due from an equity investee 
other expense income  net other expense in was million compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a million charge recorded in the first quarter of relating to the early extinguishment of the and notes redeemed in january additionally  a gain of million on the sale of our remaining interest in menu foods limited was recorded in the second quarter of interest expense net interest expense was million in  down from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower average debt levels during the year 
in addition  in january we paid interest on both the newly issued notes and on the and notes redeemed on january  this double interest payment resulted in an additional charge of million 
income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in reflecting an effective tax rate of 
this compares with million  or an effective rate of  in the effective tax rate in was favorably impacted by a million tax recovery from realizing the benefit of a capital loss 
in  a rise in canadian tax rates increased our effective tax rate 
canadian gaap results reported under canadian gaap may differ from results reported under us gaap from time to time 
under canadian gaap in  we reported net income of million and total assets of million compared to net income and total assets reported under us gaap of million and million  respectively 
there are no material us canadian gaap differences for under canadian gaap in  we reported net income of million and total assets of million compared to net income and total assets reported under us gaap of million and million  respectively 
there were two primary us canadian gaap differences for first  under canadian gaap  the and notes were considered discharged on december  when the funds to redeem the notes were transferred to an irrevocable trust 
as a result  debt extinguishment costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of under canadian gaap 
under us gaap  however  the and notes were considered discharged on january   and extinguishment costs of million  which were million after deferred income tax recovery  were recorded in the first quarter of second  under canadian gaap  the impairment loss of million relating to the change in the method for valuing goodwill is charged to opening retained earnings for the first quarter of under us gaap  the change in accounting principle is recorded as a charge to net income for outlook our ongoing focus is to increase sales  market share and profitability for us and our customers 
while the carbonated soft drink industry is experiencing low growth  the retailer brand segment of the carbonated soft drink category is experiencing positive growth in the us we believe that our existing customers are generally committed to building their retailer brand programs and we are gaining new customers as well 
expanding customer relationships as well as new product opportunities for diet soft drinks and flavored sparkling waters all contribute to our positive outlook for in  we intend to adopt a back to basics approach 
as part of our back to basics approach we intend to focus on effective logistics  managing inventory to appropriate levels and increasing plant efficiencies towards their levels 
we expect sales growth in to be between and since we believe there are significant opportunities for growth in the us market as retailer brand volumes increase 
the canadian division intends to focus on better customer support and sales execution and to expand the non supermarket channel with dedicated products to help grow its business 
the uk business intends to continue to enhance its performance through product innovation and a customer centric focus to identify opportunities 
in mexico  our business continued to make progress with sales growth in we view mexico as a strong long term growth opportunity 
as of the date of this report  we expect earnings per share  on a diluted basis  to rise to between and excluding the impact of adopting sfas r  share based payments 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for is expected to be the following in millions income from continuing operation depreciation and amortization interest expense  net income taxes ebitda total capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  which will consist primarily of manufacturing equipment in the us including the new plant in texas 
ebitda is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we use operating income as our primary measure of performance and cash flow from operations as our primary measure of liquidity 
nevertheless  we present ebitda in our filings for several reasons 
first  we use multiples of ebitda and discounted cash flows in determining the value of our operations 
in addition  we use cash return on assets  which is a financial measure calculated by dividing our annualized ebitda by our aggregate operating assets  for the purposes of calculating performance related bonus compensation for our management employees  because that measure reflects the ability of management to generate cash while preserving assets 
finally  we include ebitda in our filings because we believe that our current and potential investors use multiples of ebitda to make investment decisions about us 
investors should not consider ebitda an alternative to net income  nor to cash provided by operating activities nor any other indicator of performance or liquidity  which have been determined in accordance with us or canadian gaap 
our method of calculating ebitda may differ from the methods used by other companies and  accordingly  our ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
risks factors we face a number of risks and uncertainties  including the following we may be unable to compete successfully in the highly competitive beverage market 
the markets for our products are extremely competitive 
in comparison to the major national brand beverage manufactures  we are a relatively small participant in the industry 
we face competition from the national brand beverage manufacturers in all of our markets and from other retailer brand beverage manufacturers in the us and the us if our competitors reduce their selling prices or increase the frequency of their promotional activities in our core markets or if our customers do not allocate adequate shelf space for beverages supply  we could lose market share or be forced to reduce pricing or increase capital and other expenditures  any of which could adversely affects our profitability 
because a small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our sales  the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our sales are concentrated in a small number of customers 
our customers include many large national and regional grocery  mass merchandise  drugstore  wholesale and convenience store chains in our core markets of the us  canada and the us sales to our top customer in and accounted for and  respectively  of our total sales  and sales to the top ten customers in and were and  respectively 
we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our sales in the foreseeable future 
the loss of any significant customer  or customers which in the aggregate represent a significant portion of our sales  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
at january   we have million of customer relationships recorded as an intangible asset 
the permanent loss of any customer included in the intangible asset will result in an impairment in the value of the intangible asset 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with our raw material suppliers  we may incur higher supply costs or be unable to deliver products to our customers 
the principal raw materials required to produce our products are polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles  caps and pet preforms  cans and lids  labels  cartons and trays  concentrates  sweeteners and carbon dioxide 
we typically enter into annual supply arrangements rather than long term contracts with our suppliers  which means that our suppliers are obligated to continue to supply us with materials for one year periods  at the end of which we must either renegotiate the contracts with our incumbent suppliers or we would be required to find an alternative source for supply 
with respect to some of our key packaging supplies  such as aluminum cans and lids and pet bottles  and some of our key ingredients  such as artificial sweeteners  we have entered into long term supply agreements  the terms of which range from to years  and therefore we are assured of a supply of those key packaging supplies and ingredients of a longer period of time 
during  we extended our supply contract with crown cork seal usa  inc ccs from its original expiration date of december  to december  the contract provides that ccs will supply all of our aluminum can and end requirements worldwide  subject to certain exceptions 
the contract contains a pricing mechanism for certain materials  standard representations  warranties  indemnities and termination events  including termination events related to bankruptcy or insolvency of either party 
as with our annual supply contracts  we must either renegotiate these long term supply agreements with the incumbent suppliers when they expire or find alternative sources for supply 
we rely upon our ongoing relationships with our key suppliers to support our operations 
we believe that we will be able to either renegotiate contracts with these suppliers when they expire or  alternatively  if we are unable to renegotiate contracts with our key suppliers  we believe that we could replace them 
we could  however  incur higher ingredient and packaging supply costs in renegotiating contracts with existing suppliers or replacing those suppliers or we could experience temporary dislocations in our ability to deliver products to our customers  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our ingredients and packaging supplies are subject to price increases and we may be unable to effectively pass rising costs on to our customers 
we bear the risk of increasing prices on the ingredients and packaging in our products 
the majority of our ingredient and packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce them 
aluminum for cans  resin for pet bottles and high fructose corn syrup for sweeteners are examples of these underlying commodities 
in addition  the contracts for certain of our ingredients and packaging materials permit our suppliers to increase the costs they charge us based on increases in their cost of converting those underlying commodities into the materials that we purchase 
in certain cases those increases are subject to negotiated limits and in other cases  they are not 
these changes in the prices that we pay for ingredients and packaging materials occur at times that vary by product and supplier  but are principally on semi annual and annual bases 
accordingly  we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these ingredients and packaging materials  including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise them and  to some extent  the costs of converting those commodities into finished products 
we do not use derivatives to manage this risk 
if the cost of these ingredients or packaging materials increase  we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through adjustments to the prices we charge 
if we cannot pass on these increases to our customers on a timely basis  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we fail to manage our expanding operations successfully  our business and financial results may be materially and adversely affected 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to manage new acquisitions 
in recent years  we have grown our business and beverage offerings primarily through acquisition of other companies  new product lines and growth with key customers 
a part of our strategy is to continue to expand our business through acquisitions and alliances 
to succeed with this strategy  we must identify appropriate acquisition or strategic alliance candidates 
the success of this strategy also depends on our ability to manage and integrate acquisitions and alliances at a pace consistent with the growth of our business 
we cannot provide assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available  that we will continue to acquire business and product lines or that any of the businesses or product lines that we acquire or align with will be integrated successfully into our business or prove profitable 
our success depends  in part  on our intellectual property  which we may be unable to protect 
we possess certain intellectual property that is important to our business 
this intellectual property includes trade secrets  in the form of the concentrate formulae for most of the beverages that we produce  and trademarks for the names of the beverages that we sell  which are trademarks that we either own or license from our retailer brand customers and others 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
to protect this intellectual property  we rely principally on contractual restrictions in agreements such as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and customers  and on common law protections afforded to trade secrets and proprietary know how and the statutory protections afforded to trademarks 
in addition  we will vigorously pursue any person who infringes on our intellectual property using any and all legal remedies available 
notwithstanding our efforts  we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property for a number of reasons  including our competitors may independently develop intellectual property that is similar to or better than ours  employees  consultants and customers may not abide by their contractual agreements and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive  or those agreements may prove to be unenforceable or more limited than anticipated  foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights  and our intellectual property rights may be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  it would weaken our competitive position and we could face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
at january   we had million of rights recorded as an intangible asset 
our geographic diversity subjects us to the risk of currency fluctuations 
we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  including those between the us dollar  on the one hand  and the canadian dollar and the pound sterling  on the other hand 
our operations outside of the us accounted for approximately of our sales 
accordingly  currency fluctuations in respect of our outstanding non us dollar denominated net asset balances may affect our reported results and competitive position 
a portion of our indebtedness is variable rate debt  and changes in interest rates could adversely affect us by causing us to incur higher interest costs with respect to such variable rate debt 
our credit facilities subject us to interest rate risk 
we have a secured revolving credit facility  under which we borrow from time to time for various purposes  including to fund our day to day operations and to finance additional acquisitions 
the maximum amount that we may borrow under this facility was increased from million to million on april  this credit facility expires december  and we are currently negotiating a new facility 
as of january   total borrowings under this facility were million 
the interest rate applicable to our revolving credit facility is variable  meaning that the rate at which we pay interest on amounts borrowed under the facility fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
accordingly  with respect to any amounts from time to time outstanding under this facility  we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
we do not currently use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure 
however  we do regularly review the structure of our indebtedness and consider changes to the proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt through refinancing  interest rate swaps or other measures in response to the changing economic environment 
we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to refinance our indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us 
if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or otherwise adequately manage our debt structure in response to changes in the market  our interest expense could increase  which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to restore the efficiency of our us plant operations 
our us plants were unable to produce as efficiently in as in prior years 
as a consequence  our cost of product was higher and  in addition  we had to ship product between plants at significant added cost in order to be able to supply us customers in a timely manner 
if we are unable to restore our plants to their previously achieved levels of operating performance we may continue to incur higher manufacturing costs 
in addition we may incur higher costs as a result of having to ship product between plants in order to satisfy customer demand 
we are not in compliance with the requirements of the ontario environmental protection act epa and  if the ontario government seeks to enforce those requirements or implements modifications to them  we could be adversely affected 
certain regulations under the epa provide that a minimum percentage of a bottler s soft drink sales within specified areas in ontario must be made in refillable containers 
the penalty for non compliance is a fine  which for companies ranges from  per day on which the offense occurs or continues for the first conviction to  per day for each subsequent conviction  although such fines may be increased to equal the amount of monetary benefit acquired by the offender as a result of the commission of the offense 
we  and we believe other industry participants  are currently not in compliance with the requirements of the epa 
ontario is not enforcing the epa at this time  but if it chose to enforce the epa in the future  we could incur fines for non compliance and the possible prohibition of sales of soft drinks in non refillable containers in ontario 
we estimate that approximately of our sales would be affected by the possible limitation on sales of soft drinks in non refillable containers in ontario if the ontario ministry of the environment initiated an action to enforce the provisions of the epa against us 
in april  the ontario ministry of the environment proposed to revoke these regulations in favor of new mechanisms under the ontario waste diversion act to enhance diversion from disposal of carbonated soft drink containers 
on december   the ontario provincial government approved the implementation of the blue box program plan under the ministry of environment waste diversion act 
the program requires those parties who are brand owners or licensees of rights to brands which are manufactured  packaged or distributed for sale in ontario to contribute to the net cost of the blue box program 
we generally manufacture  package and distribute products for and on behalf of third party customers 
therefore  we do not believe that we will be responsible for direct costs of the program 
however  our customers may attempt to pass these costs  or a portion of them  onto us 
we do not believe that the costs for which we may ultimately be responsible under this program will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  however  we cannot guarantee this outcome 
the blue box program does not revoke any of the regulations mentioned above under the epa regarding refillable containers  although the industry anticipates that they will be reversed in the near future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
operations outside of the us accounted for approximately of sales and of sales  and are concentrated principally in the uk  and canada 
our debt instruments excluding the uk credit facility are denominated in uk dollars 
we translate the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations using average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
the effect of a change in foreign currency exchange rates among the us dollar versus the canadian dollar and pound sterling at current levels of foreign debt and operations would be immaterial to our financial condition and profitability 
in  we entered into cash flow hedges to mitigate exposure to declines in the value of the canadian dollar and pound sterling attributable to certain forecasted us dollar raw material purchases of the canadian and us and european business segments 
the hedges consist of monthly foreign exchange options to buy us dollars at fixed rates per canadian dollar and pound sterling and mature at various dates through december  in addition  we entered into one forward foreign exchange contract to purchase us dollars at a fixed rate per pound sterling which matured in january the fair market value of the foreign exchange options and the forward contract is included in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the instruments are cash flow hedges under sfas  accordingly  changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge instruments are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and prepaid expenses and other assets are recorded in earnings in the same periods in which the forecasted purchases or payments affect earnings 
at january   the fair value of the options are forward contract was million and we recorded a million unrealized loss in comprehensive income in debt obligations and interest rates we have exposure to interest rate risk from our short term and long term debt 
our long term debt is fixed and our short term debt is variable 
our short term credit facilities are most vulnerable to fluctuations in the us short term base rate and the libor rate 
at current debt levels  a hypothetical increase of in either interest rate measure would not be material to our cash flows or our results of operations 
the weighted average interest rate of our debt outstanding at january  was 
we regularly review the structure of our indebtedness and consider changes to the proportion of floating versus fixed rate debt through refinancing  interest rate swaps or other measures in response to the changing economic environment 
historically  we have not used derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk 
if we use and fail to manage these derivative instruments successfully  or if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or otherwise increase our debt capacity in response to changes in the marketplace  the expense associated with debt service could increase 
this would negatively impact our financial condition and profitability 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with long term debt obligations as of january  the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity 
interest rates disclosed represent the actual weighted average rates as of january  debt maturing in in millions of us dollars thereafter total fair value debt fixed rate weighted average interest rate for debt maturing
