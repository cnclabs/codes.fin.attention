environmental 
a portion of our business involves the planning  design  program and construction management and operation and maintenance of pollution control facilities  as well as the assessment  design and management of remediation activities at hazardous waste or superfund sites and military bases 
in addition  we contract with us governmental entities to destroy hazardous materials  including chemical agents and weapons stockpiles 
these activities require us to manage  handle  remove  treat  transport and dispose of toxic or hazardous substances 
some environmental laws including the resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended  or rcra  and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended  or cercla  as well as other governmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of the clean up of contaminated facilities or sites upon present and former owners and operators as well as generators  transporters and persons arranging for the treatment or disposal of such substances 
in addition  while we strive to handle hazardous and toxic substances with care and in accordance with safe methods  the possibility of accidents  leaks  spills and the events of force majeure always exist 
humans exposed to these materials  including workers or subcontractors engaged in the transportation and disposal of hazardous materials  and persons in affected areas may be injured or become ill  resulting in lawsuits that expose us to liability and may result in substantial damage awards against us 
liabilities for contamination or human exposure to hazardous or toxic materials or a failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial costs to us  including clean up costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party claims for property damage or personal injury  or cessation of remediation activities 

table of contents some of our business operations are covered by public law  which provides for government indemnification against claims and damages arising out of unusually hazardous activities performed at the request of the government 
due to changes in public policies and law  however  government indemnification may not be available in the case of any future claims or liabilities relating to other hazardous activities that we undertake to perform 
government procurement 
the services we provide to the us federal government are subject to the federal acquisition regulation  the truth in negotiations act  the cost accounting standards  the service contract act  department of defense security regulations and other rules and regulations applicable to government contracts 
these laws and regulations affect how we transact business with our government clients and in some instances  impose added costs to our business operations 
a violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to fines  contract termination or suspension of future contracts 
our government clients can also terminate or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience  and many of our government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually 
other regulations and requirements 
we provide services to the us department of defense and other defense related entities  which require specialized professional qualifications and security clearances 
in addition  as engineering design services professionals  we are subject to a variety of local  state and foreign licensing and permit requirements

over the past year  the urs division and the eg g division have jointly pursued a number of homeland security projects  and have been successful in marketing eg g s technical capabilities to urs established state and local government clients 
seasonality we experience seasonal trends in our business caused by the independence day  thanksgiving  christmas and new year s holidays 
our revenues are typically lower during these times of the year because many of our clients employees as well as our own employees take vacations during these holidays  resulting in fewer billable hours worked on projects and thus lesser revenues recognized 
in addition to the holidays  our business is affected similarly by the seasonal weather when some of our offices have to close temporarily due to severe winter and or tropical storms 
fiscal year change effective january   we will begin reporting our financial results on a week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to december st  with interim quarters ending on the fridays closest to march st  june th and september th 
our fiscal year began on november  and ended on october  the period from november  to december  will be treated as a transition period  for which we will file a transition report on form q by february  raw materials our business is not heavily dependent on raw materials 
risks associated with the procurement of raw materials for our construction services projects are generally passed through to the clients 
we do not foresee the lack of availability of raw materials as a factor that could have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term

thus  if we do not continue to maintain these policies  we will have no coverage for claims made after the termination date even for claims based on events that occurred during the term of coverage 
we intend to maintain these policies  however  we may be unable to maintain existing coverage levels 
we have maintained insurance without lapse for many years with limits in excess of losses sustained
