critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies as discussed below require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that could materially affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the company derives revenues from the following sources license fees  support and service fees and hardware sales 
license fee revenue 
for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software  the company recognizes software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
the company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services or elements 
none of these elements are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other elements 
sop  as amended by sop  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
fair value is determined for license fees based upon the price charged when sold separately 
in the event that we determine that vsoe does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of a software arrangement  but does exist for all of the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized the residual method allowed by sop under the residual method  a residual amount of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements after the established fair value of all undelivered elements has been deducted 
support and service fee revenue 
software implementation services are generally for training  implementation  and configuration of licensed software 
these services are not considered essential to the functionality of the related software 
vsoe of fair value is established by pricing used when these services are sold separately 
generally  for implementation services under  revenue is recognized when services are completed 
on certain larger implementations  revenue is recognized based on milestones during the implementation 
milestones are triggered by tasks completed or based on direct labor hours 
maintenance support revenue is recognized pro rata over the contract period  typically one year 
vsoe of fair value is determined based on contract renewal rates 
outsourced data processing services and atm  debit card  and other transaction processing services revenues are recognized in the month the transactions were processed or the services were rendered 
hardware revenue 
hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer  when title and risk of loss are transferred 
vsoe of fair value is determined based on pricing used when the items are sold separately 
the company also remarkets maintenance contracts on hardware to our customers 
hardware maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the agreement period 
depreciation and amortization expense the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists 
we believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term  but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company s future consolidated operating results 
all long lived assets are tested for valuation and potential impairment on a scheduled annual basis
