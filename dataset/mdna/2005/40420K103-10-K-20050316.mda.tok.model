item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and the results of our operations 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
certain statements made in our discussion may be forward looking 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from our expectations 
see cautionary statements at the beginning of this report on form k for additional discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties 
unless the context requires otherwise  when we refer to we  us and our  we are describing harken energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
overview we are an independent oil and gas exploration  exploitation  development  production and trading company operating both internationally and domestically 
our operations are divided into three operating segments 
our domestic operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary  gulf energy management company gem 
gem s operations consist of exploration  exploitation  development  production and acquisition efforts in the united states located principally in the onshore and offshore gulf coast regions of south texas and louisiana 
our international crude oil operations are conducted through our owned subsidiary  global energy development plc global with activities in colombia  panama and peru 
during  we invested in international business associates  ltd 
iba which comprises our third segment 
iba is in the initial stages of operations and focuses primarily on opportunities created by the recent deregulation of the energy markets in eastern europe by trading energy futures or other energy based contracts  principally in hungary and the united states 
our revenues are primarily derived from production from our oil and gas properties 
gem operates approximately of its natural gas and crude oil properties in the united states 
global operates of its crude oil producing properties  all located in colombia 
our revenues are a function of the oil and gas volumes produced and the prevailing commodity price at the time of production  and certain quality and transportation discounts 
the commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas as well as the timing of production volumes have a significant impact on our operating income 
from time to time we enter into hedging contracts to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to declines in market prices 
as of december  gem had approximately bcfe of proved oil and gas reserves net to our interest with discounted future net cash flows  discounted at  of approximately million 
at december   gem represented of our consolidated oil and gas proved reserve volumes  and in  gem represented approximately of our consolidated oil and gas revenues 
in  gem s oil and gas revenues were comprised of approximately oil sales and natural gas sales 
substantially all of gem s production is concentrated in four oil and gas fields along the onshore and offshore texas and louisiana gulf coast 
revenues from global are derived solely from our colombian oil production 
as of december  we had approximately million barrels of international proved oil reserve volumes net to our interest with discounted future net cash flows  discounted at  of approximately million 
approximately  barrels of proved oil reserve volumes and million of discounted future net cash flows are 
table of contents attributable to a minority interest of a consolidated subsidiary 
all of global s proved reserve volumes are located in colombia 
during  global produced  barrels of oil in colombia generating oil revenues of approximately million 
global represented of our total proved reserves at december  and approximately of our consolidated oil and gas revenues in global s activities in panama and peru  thus far  have been limited to technical evaluations of potential exploration areas 
operating highlights during  we increased our capital expenditures over compared to the prior year with drilling and exploration expenditures totaling approximately million 
approximately million of these capital expenditures were associated with each of global and gem 
during  gem participated in the drilling of gross wells with an average completion rate of and an average finding cost of approximately per mcfe 
during  global drilled the estero well and recompleted several wells including the tilodrian and macaranes wells included in the new rio verde exploration and production contract 
also in  global signed two new exploration and production contracts covering more than  acres in colombia  which included the rio verde exploration and production contract 
also in september  global signed a new exploration and production contract with the national hydrocarbons agency of the republic of colombia for the rio verde area located in the central llanos region 
the contract assigns global exclusive exploration and production rights to  acres located approximately kilometers north of global s palo blanco complex 
during phase of the contract  global was required to equip for production two existing wells  the tilodiran and macaranes  that were drilled in and and tested productive 
both of these wells were equipped for production in late and early in november  global signed an additional exploration and production contract with the same agency in colombia to explore  acres in the los hatos area which is adjacent to the palo blanco field 
we own of the contract  subject only to an initial royalty payable to the colombian ministry of energy 
the royalty may be adjusted in the future based on future production 
under the terms contract  global is required to drill one exploratory well during phase within months of contract signing 
at global s option  global may elect to add up to additional phases  each requiring an additional exploratory well to be drilled within a month period 
during phase  twenty five kilometers of d seismic may be acquired in lieu of an exploratory well 
in december  global was notified that perupetro sa  the national oil company of peru  had approved our application for an exploration and production contract in peru for block subject to the completion of regulatory procedures  global expects to sign its first exploration and production contract in peru during the first quarter of we expect to drill our first well under the new contract in during the initial three phases of the peru contract  only one well is required in addition to certain exploratory studies and work requirements 
should global determine  at its discretion  to proceed with phases to of the contract  additional wells may be required 
in september we invested million in iba in exchange for  convertible preferred shares of iba representing a beneficial ownership interest in that entity 
in addition  while our 
table of contents investment remains outstanding  harken will hold the majority of the board positions in iba 
we anticipate iba will trade gas futures contracts in hungary and the united states 
through iba  we expect to capitalize on the skills  knowledge and relationships that iba s principals have developed through a five year presence in hungary  the ukraine and russia 
we anticipate iba will increase its trading activities during outlook during we are concentrating on the development and growth of our oil and gas assets and energy based growth opportunities 
in february  our board of directors approved the capital expenditure program of approximately million 
of the capital expenditure budget  approximately million is related to gem and approximately million is related to global s planned capital expenditures 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures through available cash on hand and through projected cash flow from operations in possible weakening commodity prices  a decline in drilling success or substantial delays in bringing on production from wells drilled could cause us to reduce our drilling plans 
the majority of our planned capital expenditures for are discretionary  and as a result  will be curtailed if sufficient funds are not available 
the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices has a significant impact on the profitability of our oil and gas operations 
overall  the oil and gas industry benefited from increased oil and gas commodity prices in helping to generate improved industry cash flows from operations 
worldwide crude oil inventories during were low compared to average inventories over the last ten years 
these lower worldwide crude oil inventories helped contribute to higher crude oil prices as compared to average crude oil prices over the past several years 
opec restrained marginal international oil supplies in thereby preventing the growth in oil inventories 
geopolitical disruptions to the international supply of oil occurred in nigeria  venezuela and iraq 
both venezuela and iraq had not returned to their average production levels by the end of worldwide demand for oil and gas increased in in response to improving worldwide economic conditions 
worldwide natural gas inventories in were slightly above the five year average  but improved demand for natural gas helped contribute to higher natural gas prices in as compared to average natural gas prices over the past several years 
industry wide oil and gas drilling activity increased domestically and abroad in in response to improved industry cash flows from operations 
capital structure effect of convertible debt and equity instruments on dilution during  we reduced our debt obligations through repurchases for cash at a discount  conversions into our common stock or through issuances of debt or equity securities with more favorable terms 
during  we continued in our efforts to improve our capital structure while focusing on developing our oil and gas assets and improving our cash flow from operations 
during the two years ended december   we reduced our debt obligations by to million at year end as of december   we had unrestricted cash of million and working capital of almost million 
our debt to equity ratio was to with approximately million in shareholders equity at december  
table of contents many of these capital structure changes involved the issuance of our common stock or conversion of certain existing convertible debt and preferred stock into shares of our common stock or into instruments convertible into shares of our common stock 
as a result  our common shares outstanding increased from million shares outstanding at the beginning of to approximately million shares outstanding at december  at march   if our outstanding debt and equity instruments were exercised and or converted  we would issue the following amount of our common stock conversion exercise price a common stock convertible notes convertible notes series j preferred series m preferred series g preferred series g preferred series g preferred common stock warrants series j common stock warrants and rights series l common stock warrants series m warrants common stock potentially issued upon conversion exercise a certain conversion and exercise prices are subject to adjustment under certain circumstances global warrants held by global s minority interest owners in  we received the proceeds of a term loan the investor term loan in the aggregate principal amount of  to lyford investments enterprises ltd 
lyford in exchange for a loan of  cash 
as additional consideration for the investor term loan  as amended  we issued to lyford warrants the lyford warrants to purchase up to  shares of global held by us at a price of uk pence per share 
in august  global issued to its minority shareholders warrants to purchase up to  shares of global stock at uk pence per share the minority shareholder warrants 
the lyford warrants expire in october and the minority shareholder warrants expire in august global s shares are traded on the alternative investment market of the london stock exchange aim 
under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  we are required to record the minority shareholder warrants and the lyford warrants collectively referred to as global warrants held by outside parties as derivatives in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires us to record the estimated fair value of the warrants as a liability at issuance and to adjust the liability to estimated fair value each period with any changes in value reflected in earnings 
the fair value of the global warrants held by outside parties was calculated by a third party firm  using the black scholes pricing model  based primarily on the underlying market price of global s common stock 

table of contents during  the trading price of global s shares increased dramatically causing a substantial increase in the fair value of the liability of the global warrants held by outside parties 
during  there was a increase in global s common share price from approximately uk pence at december  to uk pence at december  in  we recorded an unrealized loss of million relating to the increase in value of the global warrants held by outside parties 
in  we could recognize additional losses if global s share price increases and possible gains if global s share price decreases 
our earnings could continue to fluctuate by material amounts until the warrants expire in we anticipate that the global warrants held by outside parties will be exercised prior to expiration which will dilute our ownership in global but will not require a cash outlay from us to settle the million global warrant liability that is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  global warrants held by harken as part of global s august issuance of warrants to its shareholders  global issued to us warrants to purchase  shares of global s stock at uk pence per share 
since global is a consolidated subsidiary  this warrant issuance is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of these warrants at december  was approximately million  as calculated by a third party firm 
these warrants expire in august we anticipate exercising these warrants prior to expiration which would require a cash outlay from us to global of approximately million uk pounds sterling or approximately million using the december  exchange rate 
global stock options in addition to the global stock warrants described above  certain employees and directors of global hold options to purchase  shares of global s common stock at december  potential change in our ownership of global at december  we owned of global s common stock 
our ownership in global may be reduced if the warrants and options described above are exercised 
as of december   the following global warrants and options were outstanding lyford warrants uk pence  a minority shareholder warrants uk pence  a global warrants held by harken uk pence  b global employee stock options uk pence global employee stock options uk pence a at december   these warrants are recorded as a liability of million in the consolidated balance sheet 
b since global is a consolidated subsidiary  the warrant issuance is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair market value of these warrants at december  was approximately million  as calculated by a third party firm 

table of contents if all global warrants and stock options were exercised  our fully diluted ownership of global s issued and outstanding ordinary common shares could decrease from to 
significant ownership of our stock as of march   lyford beneficially owned approximately of the combined voting power of our common stock 
lyford is in a position to exercise significant influence over the election of our board of directors and the approval of other matters 
see risk factors set forth in this section 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires us to use estimates and make assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  industry conditions and various other factors which we believe are reasonable 
actual results could vary significantly from our estimates and assumptions as additional information becomes known 
see note summary of significant accounting policies contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for further discussion of our critical accounting policies 
the more significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions are proved reserves our estimates of proved reserves are based on quantities of oil and gas reserves which current engineering data indicates are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves are key elements in determining our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and our full cost ceiling limitation 
estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise because of uncertainties in projecting rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures  interpretations of geological  geophysical  engineering and production data and the quality and quantity of available data 
changing economic conditions also may affect our estimates of proved reserves due to changes in developmental costs and changes in commodity prices that may impact reservoir economics 
we utilize independent reserve engineers to estimate our proved reserves annually 
see note oil and gas disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations represent our best estimate of the fair value of our future abandonment costs associated with our oil and gas properties  including the costs of removal and disposition of tangible equipment  site and environmental restoration 
we estimate the fair value of our retirement costs in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
the determination of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation generally involves estimating the fair value of the obligation at the end of the property s useful life and then discounting it to present value using our credit adjusted  risk free rate of return 
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding the expected removal and site restoration costs  timing and present value discount rates 
changes in the estimated useful life and the fair value of the asset retirement obligation are imprecise since the removal activities will generally occur several years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental  safety considerations that may ultimately impact the amount of the obligation 

table of contents derivative instruments we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
to reduce the impact of this risk in earnings and to increase the predictability of our cash flow  from time to time we enter into certain derivative contracts  primarily collars and floors for a portion of our north american oil and gas operations 
as required by sfas  we are required to record all derivative contracts at fair value on our balance sheet 
changes in fair value are required to be recorded in income or income and other comprehensive income  depending on the hedging designation and the hedge effectiveness 
our estimates of fair value are based on market quotes from third parties 
while the fair values of our derivatives have fluctuated significantly  our estimates of fair value have historically been consistent with the settlement amounts 
fair value of our debt and equity transactions many of our various debt and equity transactions require us to determine the fair value of a debt or equity instrument in order to properly record the transaction in our financial statements 
we utilize independent third parties to assist us in determining the fair value of many of our transactions  including the global warrants held by outside parties 
fair value is generally determined by applying widely acceptable valuation models  i 
e the black scholes valuation model using the trading price of the underlying instrument or by comparison to instruments with comparable maturities and terms 
recent accounting pronouncements on september   the securities and exchange commission  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab regarding the application of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations aros  by oil and gas producing companies following the full cost accounting method 
pursuant to sab  oil and gas producing companies that have adopted sfas should exclude the future cash outflows associated with settling aros aro liabilities from the computation of the present value of estimated future net revenues for the purposes of the full cost ceiling calculation 
in addition  estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values  that have been capitalized aro assets should be included in the amortization base for computing depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
sab is effective prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal quarter beginning after october  we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of sab had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued statement revised  share based payment that will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions eg  issuance of stock options and restricted stock to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
statement r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
for us  sfas r is effective for the first reporting period after june  and is applicable only to new awards or awards that have been modified  repurchased or cancelled after the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our company 

table of contents on december   the fasb issued statement  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 to clarify the accounting for nonmonetrary exchanges of similar productive assets 
sfas provides a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the statement will be applied prospectively and is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not have any nonmonetary transactions for any period presented to which this statement would apply 
results of operations for the purposes of discussion and analysis  we present a summary of our consolidated results of operations followed by a more detailed discussion and analysis of our three segments 
consolidated statement of operations comparisons net loss and per share amounts for each of the years in the three year period ended december   were as follows thousands of dollars  except per share amounts net loss net income loss attributed to common stock net income loss per share basic diluted 
table of contents the primary components or our net loss for the year ended december  compared to the net loss for the year ended december  and net loss for the year ended december  compared to the net loss for the year ended december   are outlined in the table below favorable unfavorable variance thousands of dollars compared to compared to gem operating profit global operating profit iba operating profit general and administrative expenses  net depreciation and amortization full cost valuation allowance provision for asset impairments litigation and contingent liability settlements  net accretion expense interest expense and other  net gains from exchanges and extinguishments of debt income tax expense benefit increase in global warrant liability gain loss on investment cumulative effect of change in accounting principle other gem s operating profit is calculated as oil and gas revenues less oil and gas operating expenses 
global s operating profit is calculated as oil revenues less operating expenses  before reduction for minority interest 
iba s operating profit reflects net trading losses 
iba s net trading losses for are included in interest and other income gem operating profit and global operating profit during and our operating profits were dramatically affected by rising commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil 
our average realized natural gas price per mcf increased from in to in and to in  an increase of in and in crude oil prices experienced similar increases 
gem s average realized price for crude oil sales per barrel increased from in to in and to in global s average realized price for crude oil sales per barrel increased from in to in and to in these increases helped to mitigate our oil and gas production declines in and during our natural gas production declined and crude oil production declined from the previous year 
this decline was primarily attributable to cutbacks in our capital expenditure programs during and 
table of contents in  our consolidated net natural gas production declined an additional to bcf and crude oil net production declined to  bbls 
the decrease in gem s oil and gas production was due to the december sale of certain texas panhandle properties and due to hurricane ivan which passed through the louisiana gulf coast in september and shut down offshore oil and gas wells and facilities for a portion of the fourth quarter of production volumes from the lake raccourci field and main pass field and facility were substantially reduced due to the severe storms in september and october the majority of gem s oil and gas production is located along the gulf of mexico 
the decrease in global s crude oil production was primarily due to declines in producing wells and workovers in late of certain wells that reduced oil production during the workover process 
oil production from new wells drilled during helped to mitigate the overall decrease in volumes 
general and administrative expenses the decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to was primarily due to employee reductions during offset by related severance costs 
we reduced our employee count by  from employees to employees in the decrease in general and administrative expenses over the prior year period was partially mitigated by increased legal and professional costs in associated with our capital restructuring plan 
during  our general and administrative were approximately equal to the costs incurred in decreases in general and administrative expenses in attributable to a full year of savings for the staff reductions in  lower insurance costs and a decrease in legal and bank commitments and agent fees was offset by start up costs associated with iba and an increase in professional and audit fees associated with implementation of the sarbanes oxley internal control compliance requirements 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in primarily due to the consolidation of a full year of iba s operations 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense after realizing a decrease in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense during  our dd a expense increased approximately to million 
dd a of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit of production basis in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
in  as our consolidated oil and gas production decreased approximately  the increase in dd a in compared to  is solely attributable to the increase in the dd a rates per unit 
in  gem s average dd a rate increased to per mcfe primarily due to decreased oil and gas reserve volumes as a result of our december sale of the panhandle properties 
global s average dd a rate decreased approximately to per mcfe in full cost valuation allowances during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash full cost valuation allowances totaling million related to global s peru and panama unevaluated property costs incurred for specific areas which global no longer intended to pursue under its technical evaluation agreements in peru and panama 
global has no proved reserves associated with the peru or panama technical evaluation agreements 
we did not record any full cost valuation allowances in or 
table of contents given the volatility of oil and gas prices  our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline in the future  even if only for a short period of time  we may record additional impairments of oil and gas properties 
in addition  additional impairments could occur if costs are incurred in excess of any increases in the present value of future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  or if properties are sold for proceeds less than the discounted present value of the related proved oil and gas reserves 
for further discussion  see note oil and gas properties in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item provision for asset impairments during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of approximately  on certain colombia oilfield equipment consisting of casing and tubing inventory 
based on the low industry demand for such equipment in light of heightened colombia security concerns  the carrying value of such inventory was in excess of estimated future cash flows from the sale or use of such equipment 
we did not record any asset impairments in or litigation and contingent liability settlements during and we settled various liabilities  contingencies and lawsuits  some of which were settled for amounts less than we had previously recorded 
in we recorded litigation and contingent liability settlement expenses of million related to a mediated settlement of the petrochemical litigation and a benefit of approximately million for a litigation settlement that was settled for an amount less than we had recorded in previous years 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an expense of million associated with settlement related to the rice lawsuit 
during  we recorded no litigation and contingent liability expense amounts 
as of december   we believe our reserves for litigation and contingent liabilities are adequate 
for further discussion see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item interest expense and other interest expense and other includes the following for each of the years in the three year period ended december  thousands of dollars interest expense on debt instruments amortization of debt issuance costs standby commitment fee rights offering colombian war tax all other our annual interest expense and other has decreased significantly over the three year period ended december  due primarily to the reduction of our overall debt as a result of our and capital 
table of contents restructuring plan 
the overall reduction in our debt balances has reduced interest expense by over during this three year period 
interest expense and other decreased during compared to  primarily due to the overall reduction in our current and long term debt 
the decrease in interest expense and other was mitigated by our expensing of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately  related to the issuance of warrants to purchase global ordinary shares which were issued to lyford in consideration for the investor term loan which was paid in full in march in addition  we expensed  of unamortized debt issuance costs of a promissory note issued to waverley investments limited  which was redeemed with cash in full in june interest and other expense decreased million during compared to the decrease was almost exclusively due the full year impact of reduced levels of debt in versus gains from exchanges and extinguishments of debt during and  we repurchased or exchanged certain of our european notes for cash and or other debt securities 
during  we recorded a gain of  relating to the acquisition or exchange of  principal amount of european notes 
also  in august  we repurchased  principal amount of benz convertible notes for  in cash and recorded a gain of approximately million related to that transaction 
during  we recorded a gain of approximately million from cash purchases  exchanges and or payments of outstanding european notes and benz convertible notes 
during we repaid the principal amount of the senior secured notes  at a discount of approximately  recording a gain on extinguishment of  in december  we redeemed the december principal installment of the convertible notes in accordance with the terms of the notes  for a number of shares of our common stock equal to of the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on the december settlement date  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of approximately  for the payment of the december installment of the convertible notes for the difference between the carrying value of the convertible notes and the fair market value of the million shares of our common stock issued 
income tax expense benefit during we realized an income tax benefit of  due primarily to a refund related to the amended colombian income tax declaration for global s wholly owned subsidiary  harken de colombia  ltd 
we received no such refund in either or gain loss on investment in december  we exchanged  of our shares of common stock of global for  of the redeemable ordinary common shares of new opportunities investment trust plc noit  an investment trust organized under the laws of the united kingdom a public limited company admitted for trading on the alternative investment market of the london stock exchange 
we accounted for the  ordinary shares of noit as an investment in available for sale securities in accordance with statement of 
table of contents financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain investment in debt and equity transactions 
available for sale marketable securities are recorded at fair value with gains or losses deferred in other comprehensive income until it is sold  except for any loss that is considered a permanent impairment of the investment 
a permanent impairment of an available for sale marketable security is required to be reflected in earnings immediately 
subsequent to our investment in noit  the market price of noit s common stock experienced a continuing steep decline and a continued lack of trading activity 
we considered our investment in noit to be permanently impaired 
in and again in early we recorded the impairment of our noit investment as an expense of  and  respectively in the consolidated statement of operations for and in late the stock price of noit began to increase and its trading activity began to stabilize and improve  and by the end of we had recovered  of the previously recognized losses  which we recorded as a deferred gain in other comprehensive income as of december  in february  we sold all of our shares of noit for million  recognizing a gain of  in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  approximately  of the gain on sale of investment in was a recovery of our previously recognized losses in and global warrant liability in july and august  we issued a term loan to lyford in exchange for million in cash and warrants to purchase from us a total of million shares of global s common stock  representing approximately of our holdings of global shares 
the warrants expire october and are exercisable at uk pence per share the approximate quoted market price of global s common stock at the date of issuance of the warrants 
in august  global issued warrants to its minority shareholders to purchase  shares of global s common stock at uk pence per share 
as more fully described in note global warrants and stock options in the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in part ii  item  we are required to recognize the fair value of the global warrants held by outside parties as a liability with any changes in fair value reflected in earnings 
we engage a third party firm to determine the fair value of the warrants  which is based in part  on the underlying share price of global s common stock 
at issuance in  the fair value of the warrants was estimated to be approximately  and throughout and  global s common stock experienced insignificant fluctuations in value 
as of december   the fair value of the warrants was determined to be approximately  and a loss of  associated with the increase in the global warrant liability was recorded in earnings in following global s may announcement of year end results and the successful drilling of the estero well  global s share price increased significantly 
throughout  global s common share price has fluctuated but has increased in value from approximately uk pence at december  to uk pence at december  as of december   the fair value of the global warrant liability was estimated to be approximately million  and we recognized a loss in of million for the increase in the fair value of the global warrants held by outside parties 
as noted earlier  our earnings could continue to fluctuate by material amounts until the warrants expire in we anticipate that the global warrants held by outside parties will be exercised prior to their expiration in  which will dilute our ownership in global 

table of contents accrual of dividends related to preferred stock all of our preferred stock issuances require us to accrue dividends 
dividends related to all of our preferred stock issuances are cumulative  and may be paid in cash or common stock  at our option 
we accrue the dividends at their cash liquidation value and reflect the accrual of dividends as a reduction in net income loss to arrive at net income loss attributable to common shareholders 
accruals of dividends related to preferred stock for each of the three years are as follows series g series g series g series g series j series l series m total exchange of preferred stock in april upon the issuance of the series g preferred  we reflected the difference between the face amount of the series g preferred and the series g preferred  plus the million in cash  less transaction fees  and the fair value of the series g preferred shares issued as exchange of preferred stock of approximately  in the consolidated condensed statement of operations for the year ended december   as an increase to net income attributed to common stock 
in october  we entered into a conversion redemption agreement the agreement with the holders of the series l preferred  pursuant to which we modified the conversion terms of the series l preferred as a part of the agreement to issue the series m cumulative convertible preferred stock the series m preferred 
we have reflected the difference between the total of the carrying amount of the series l preferred  including accrued dividends  plus the million in cash  less transaction fees  and the total of the fair value of the series m preferred  the common stock warrants issued plus the consideration paid to redeem the series l preferred as exchange of preferred stock of approximately million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as a decrease to net income attributed to common stock 
in october  we offered all series g preferred and series g preferred holders an inducement to convert their series g preferred and g preferred shares into shares of our common stock 
for a limited time  holders of series g preferred and g preferred were able to convert their preferred shares into shares of our common stock at a premium to the original conversion terms of the series g preferred and g preferred 
under the original conversion terms  the series g preferred are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of per share  and the series g preferred are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of per share 

table of contents we recognized the difference between the fair value of the common stock transferred to the holders of the series g and g preferred under the induced conversion terms and the fair value of the common stock issuable under the original conversion terms as exchange of preferred stock in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as an approximate  decrease to net income attributed to common stock 
payment of preferred stock dividends during and  we paid the accrued dividends related to preferred stock for the series g  g and g preferred with shares of our common stock 
in and we issued approximately  and  shares  respectively  of our common stock as payment for the accrued dividends related to the series g  g and g preferred 
the difference between the fair value of the shares of our common stock and the carrying value of the dividend liability  net of withholding taxes paid on behalf of the preferred shareholders  is considered a debt extinguishment of million and million in and  respectively  and is reflected as payment of preferred stock dividends as an addition to net income loss to arrive at net income loss attributable to common shareholders 
see note stockholders equity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item for further discussion 
during the proceeds allocated to the series l preferred represented a discount to the market value of the underlying shares of our common stock 
on the date of issuance  the series l preferred was convertible into shares of our common stock with a market value of approximately  greater than the proceeds we received that were attributable to the series l preferred 
this represented a beneficial conversion feature and was recorded in as a payment of preferred stock dividends as a decrease to net income loss to arrive at net income loss attributable to common shareholders 
also during  as a result of the issuance of certain equity securities and pursuant to the terms of the agreements  we adjusted the conversion and exercise prices of the series j preferred and series l preferred and common stock warrants 
we recorded payments of preferred stock dividends totaling  related to these adjustments as a decrease to net income loss to arrive at net income loss attributable to common shareholders

the following table sets forth our gem operating results for each of the years in the three year period ended december  thousands of dollars  except per unit amounts oil and gas revenues operating profit net oil sold thousands of bbls net gas sold thousands of mcf average price of oil sold per bbls average price of gas sold per mcf average production transportation costs per mcfe oil and gas revenues and oil and gas expenses for the year ended december  compared to december  gem s gross oil and gas revenues during related to the operations in the onshore and offshore areas of the texas and louisiana gulf coast and the western and panhandle regions of texas 
in march  we sold interests in oil and gas producing properties located in louisiana for approximately  in december  we sold the majority of our oil and gas properties located in the panhandle region of texas for a gross sales price of approximately million  subject to certain adjustments 
during  oil and gas revenues increased to approximately million compared to approximately million for the prior year due to an increase in average commodity prices received during  offset by declines in production 
gas revenues increased to approximately million during compared to approximately million for the prior year due to an increase in average gas prices received during  as we received an overall average price of per mcf of gas during compared to per mcf received during mitigating the increase in gas revenues was the decline in gas production of to  mcf in as compared to  mcf in oil revenues increased to approximately million during compared to approximately million during due to an increase in oil prices received during which averaged per barrel compared to per barrel in this increase in oil revenues was mitigated by a decrease in oil volumes as compared to oil and gas production volumes were lower in as compared to due primarily to high decline rates on certain lapeyrouse and lake raccourci wells which reached the end of their productive lives in specific producing zones  along with normal production decline on other producing properties 
capital expenditures to develop the domestic oil and gas assets in were minimized in order to focus capital resources on reducing outstanding debt principal balances 

table of contents oil and gas operating expense decreased to approximately million during compared to approximately million during the prior year primarily due to a decrease in oil and gas sales volumes in this decrease was mitigated by increased salt water disposal costs associated with the lake raccourci field in lafourche parish  louisiana  along with increased compressor and chemical treating costs per well 
oil and gas revenues and oil and gas expenses for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
gem s gas revenues decreased to million during compared to million for due primarily to the sale of the panhandle properties in december and the decrease in oil and gas volumes due to hurricane ivan which passed through the louisiana gulf coast in september and shut down offshore oil and gas wells and facilities for a portion of the fourth quarter production volumes in september and october from the lake raccourci field and main pass field and facility were substantially reduced due to the severe storms 
oil and gas production volumes in decreased bcfe  or approximately compared to prior year approximately bcfe of the decrease was attributable to the december sale of the panhandle properties 
the reduction in gas revenue was partially mitigated by new production from wells drilled during and the increase in natural gas prices during our average realized natural gas price increased in approximately to per mcf 
all of gem s natural gas production is sold at spot rates  which makes us susceptible to short term swings in natural gas commodity prices 
we currently hold a natural gas floor contract with a strike price per mmbtu for  mmbtus per month for the twelve month period ending december  in  we experienced an insignificant increase in gem s oil revenues compared to prior year with an increase of  to million in oil production volumes decreased to  barrels of oil in from  barrels of oil in in september and october  we were forced to curtail oil production from the main pass field and the lake raccourci field due to hurricane ivan 
weather related shut downs of gulf coast properties required extensive efforts and time to bring back on production 
by late fourth quarter  the majority of all of our gulf coast properties had resumed normal production 
the reduction in gem s oil revenues in was partially mitigated by the increase in crude oil prices 
our average oil price increased to per barrel in all of gem s oil production is sold at spot rates  which makes us susceptible to short term swings in crude oil commodity prices 
we currently hold a crude oil floor contract with a strike price per barrel for  barrels per month for the twelve month period ending december  gem s oil and gas operating expenses decreased to million during compared to million during primarily due to lower production volumes 
in addition  the panhandle properties sold in december had higher operating costs per mcfe  averaging approximately per mcfe in gem s oil and gas production volumes are expected to increase in our budgeted capital expenditures for the development of gem s oil and gas assets is approximately million  a increase in gem s capital expenditures as compared to see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 

table of contents global operations global s revenues relate to our oil operations in colombia  from production from our bolivar  bocachico and alcaravan association contract areas 
the following table sets forth global s operating results for each of the years in the three year period ended december  thousands of dollars  except per unit amounts oil revenues operating profit net oil sold thousands of barrels average price of oil sold per barrel average production transportation costs per barrel during the three year period ended december   global has experienced increasing oil revenues and operating profits and declining oil production volumes 
in  global s revenues increased approximately and increased an additional in operating profits increased in and an additional in global s operating profit  defined as revenues less lease operating expenses increased million in as compared to prior year 
the increases in operating profit and oil revenues were directly attributable to increases in realized crude oil prices 
global s realized crude oil price increased over the three year period ending december  to an average per barrel in all colombian crude oil production is sold at spot rates less quality adjustments 
oil revenues and oil expenses for the year ended december  compared to december  global s oil volumes declined in by compared to primarily to normal production decline on the producing wells  mechanical lifting inefficiencies at the canacabare well and shutting in of the catalina well  offset by new production from the cajaro well 
in  the torcaz well in bocachico association contract area was placed on production and in  global completed the drilling of the cajaro well on the alcaravan contract area with production commencing in june in march  global initiated production from the canacabare located in global s alcaravan association contract block in the llanos basin of eastern colombia 
during  daily production began from the canacabare well and produced a total of  gross barrels of oil during global s operating expenses increased from approximately million for to approximately million for  primarily due to the installation of subsurface production equipment on the canacabare well  along with generator repair costs for the bocachico contract area and the additional operating costs of the cajaro well which began production in june 
table of contents oil revenues and oil expenses for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
in april  global perforated and tested the massive ubaque zone in its estero well on global s alcaravan association contract in colombia 
production for the estero well began in may global owns a working interest in this well 
the increase in oil revenues in was mitigated due to a decrease in production volumes attributable to declines in producing wells and workovers in late of certain wells that reduced oil production during the workover process 
oil production from newly drilled and completed wells drilled during helped to mitigate the overall decrease in volumes 
middle american operating expenses increased from approximately  in to approximately  in  primarily due to workover costs mentioned above 
global s oil production volumes are expected to increase in our budgeted capital expenditures for the development of global oil assets are approximately million  a increase in global s capital expenditures as compared to see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 
iba operations as noted earlier  in september we invested million in iba 
our investment represented of the working capital of iba 
since we bear the majority of the risk and rewards of ownership and effectively control iba  we consolidate their assets  liabilities and results of operations 
as of december   iba had no liabilities and their principal asset was million in cash 
iba s cash balance represents approximately of our consolidated cash balance 
during late  iba placed minimal gas futures trades resulting in trading losses of  in  iba incurred  in general and administrative expenses primarily attributed to salaries  travel and professional fees associated with its startup and initialization of trading operations 
we anticipate iba will increase its trading operations during liquidity and capital resources financial condition as of december  thousands of dollars current ratio to to working capital total debt total cash less debt stockholders equity total debt to equity to to 
table of contents under our capital restructuring plan during  we focused our resources and efforts on repurchasing and or restructuring our outstanding debt obligations 
at the beginning of  our outstanding debt was in excess of million and we had negative working capital of approximately million 
working capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities 
during  we significantly reduced our overhead costs through cost containment and staff reductions and reduced our oil and gas capital expenditures in order to reduce our outstanding debt obligations 
during  we successfully reduced our outstanding debt obligations to approximately million outstanding at december   an reduction compared to the prior year 
many of the capital structure changes during and involved the issuance of our common stock or conversion of our debt and preferred stock into our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock 
as a result  our common shares outstanding increased from million shares at january  to million shares at december  during  we concentrated on the development and growth of our oil and gas assets and energy based growth opportunities by increasing budgeted oil and gas capital expenditures in to approximately million 
also we continued our efforts to strengthen our capital structure through extinguishing certain debt at an discount  issuing convertible debt and equity securities for approximately million in cash  converting higher yield preferred stock instruments into shares of our common stock  and repurchasing million shares of our common stock in the market 
in  our board of directors approved the capital expenditure budget totaling approximately million for gem and global  representing an increase from our capital expenditure budget 
we anticipate funding the capital expenditures programs from cash on hand and internally generated cash flow from operations 
we may continue to seek to raise additional financing through the issuance of debt  equity and convertible debt instruments  if needed  for utilization for acquisition and development opportunities as they arise 
such additional financing may include debt obligations  common stock or preferred stock issued by one or more of our subsidiaries 
cash flows from operations during  our cash flow from operations increased to million as compared to million in from increased oil and gas revenues in primarily as a result of increased commodity pricing 
at december   we ended the year with positive working capital of approximately million  with outstanding total debt of million  and cash on hand of approximately million 
iba s cash balance represents approximately of our consolidated cash balance at december  net cash from financing activities during totaled approximately million and consisted of approximately million in net cash proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and warrants  approximately million in net cash proceeds from issuances of preferred stock and warrants and approximately million in net cash proceeds from the issuance of senior convertible notes  offset by approximately million in repayments of senior secured notes and certain convertible notes and approximately million in repurchases of our common stock 
net cash used in investing activities during totaled approximately million and was primarily comprised of approximately million in capital expenditures offset by approximately million received for the sale of our investment in noit 

table of contents global s capital expenditures for totaled approximately million 
gem s capital expenditures for totaled approximately million 
obligations and commitments gem capital commitments gem s capital expenditure budget includes efforts to increase its oil and gas reserves through acquisition  exploitation and development drilling activities 
we anticipate gem capital expenditures will total approximately million during gem s capital expenditure budget focuses on the onshore and offshore gulf coast regions of texas and louisiana 
based in part upon the success of its drilling efforts in  the majority of this budgeted capital amount will be used to participate in the drilling of fifteen to twenty exploratory and development wells along the texas and louisiana gulf coast 
gem currently holds an average working interest in the lake raccourci producing wells of approximately and holds an average working interest of approximately in the lapeyrouse producing wells 
however  gem s planned north american capital expenditures for are discretionary and  as a result  will be curtailed if sufficient funds are not available 
such expenditure curtailments  however  could result in gem losing certain prospect acreage or reducing its interest in future development projects global capital commitments global anticipates international capital expenditures during will total approximately million to develop its crude oil assets in middle america 
the majority of global s capital expenditure plans are targeted for its colombian operations in the palo blanco field  bolivar field and the rio verde field under its existing association and exploration and production contracts in colombia 
approximately million is budgeted for other seismic and exploration costs in peru  panama and colombia 
approximately million of these capital expenditures result from commitments under the terms of certain of the association and exploration and production contracts entered into between global s subsidiary harken de colombia  ltd 
and ecopetrol or the national hydrocarbons agency of the republic of colombia 
these contracts required global to perform certain activities in colombia in accordance with a prescribed timetable 
as of march   global was in compliance with the requirements of each of the association and exploration and production contracts 
global s discretionary capital expenditures will be curtailed if sufficient funds are not available 
such expenditure curtailments  however  could result in global losing certain prospect acreage or reducing its interest in future development projects 
we expect to fund the budgeted capital expenditures with available cash on hand and through projected cash flow from operations in possible weakening commodity prices  a decline in drilling success or substantial delays on bringing on production form wells drilled could cause us to reduce projected expenditures 
the majority of our planned capital expenditures for are discretionary and may be curtailed or reduced if sufficient funds are not available 
convertible notes in december  we issued million principal amount of convertible notes due to certain investors 
the convertible notes may be redeemed for cash  at our option  in whole or in part  at any time  upon not less than days notice to the holders 
our convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the convertible notes are also convertible at our option into shares of our common stock if  for any period of consecutive days commencing upon registration of the underlying conversion shares  the average of the closing prices of our common stock for each trading day during such day period equals or exceeds of the convertible notes conversion price or per share of our common stock 

table of contents the convertible notes may be redeemed at our option  for cash equal to the outstanding principal and accrued interest to the date of redemption  upon not less than days notice to the noteholders 
in addition  we may redeem the relevant installment of principal and accrued and unpaid interest of the outstanding convertible notes for shares of our common stock  in each case upon not less than days notice to the noteholders 
if we elect to redeem the convertible notes for shares of our common stock  each note will be redeemed for a number of shares of our common stock equal to of the principal value of the notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption  divided by the average market price of the stock over the calendar days immediately preceding the date of the notice of redemption 
pursuant to the terms of the convertible notes  we are required to maintain unencumbered assets such that the ratio of the fair market value of the unencumbered assets to the outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes  is equal to or greater than to at december  and  we were in compliance with the asset coverage ratio under the convertible notes 
at december  and  respectively  based on the scheduled principal installments  approximately million of the convertible notes is classified as current debt in the consolidated balance sheet 
senior convertible notes in august  we issued to qualified investors  aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes due june  the notes in exchange for  in cash 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments in certain circumstances 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on december and june  commencing december  upon registration with the sec of the shares of harken s common stock into which the notes are convertible  the holders of the notes may exercise their rights to convert the notes 
the notes may be converted in whole or in part  at our option  after the effective date of the registration statement  if at any time following such effective date the average market price of our common stock over any consecutive business day period equals or exceeds of the conversion price per share 
the outstanding principal balance of the notes becomes due and payable in full on june  in cash or  at our option  in shares of our common stock equal to of the principal amount of the notes divided by the day average market price of our common shares immediately preceding the date of notice of redemption 
operational contingencies our operations are subject to stringent and complex environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations are subject to changes that may result in more restrictive or costly operations 
failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties or injunctive relief 
global s international oil exploration and production operations  including well drilling and seismic activities  require specific governmental environmental licenses and permits  the acquisition of which in the past have been subject to extensive delays 
global may continue to experience similar delays in the future 
failure to obtain these licenses and permits in a timely manner may prevent or delay our operational plans 

table of contents effective january   we changed our method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
prior to the effective date of sfas  we reflected asset retirement obligations for acquired assets net of related estimated salvage values to be realized at the time of retirement 
under the new accounting method  we recognize the full amount of asset retirement obligations beginning in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made 
at december   our asset retirement obligation liability was approximately million 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note asset retirement obligation contained in part ii  item  for further discussions 
we are currently involved in various lawsuits and other contingencies  which in our opinion  will not result in a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or operations taken as a whole

global s capital expenditures are budgeted for million 
approximately million of these capital expenditures result from commitments under the terms of certain of its association and exploration and production contracts in colombia 
however  the remaining capital expenditures are discretionary and  as a result will be curtailed if sufficient funds are not available 
such expenditure curtailments  however  could result in global losing certain prospect acreage or reducing its interest in future development projects

in addition to the above commitments  during and afterward  government authorities under gem s louisiana state leases and operators under other north american operators may also request gem to participate in the cost of drilling additional exploratory and development wells 
we may fund these future domestic expenditures at our discretion 
further  the cost of drilling or participating in the drilling of any such exploratory and development wells cannot be quantified at this time since the cost will depend on factors out of our control  such as the timing of the request  the depth of the wells and the location of the property 
our discretionary capital expenditures for will be curtailed if we do not have sufficient funds available 
if we do not have sufficient funds or otherwise chooses not to participate  we may experience a delay of future cash flows from proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
such expenditure curtailments could also result in us losing certain prospect acreage or reducing our interest in future development projects 
as of december   we had no material purchase obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
adequacy of capital sources and liquidity we believe that we have the ability to provide for our operational needs and our capital program through projected operating cash flow  cash on hand  and our ability to raise capital 
our operating cash flow would be adversely affected by declines in oil and natural gas prices  which can be volatile 
should projected operating cash flow decline  we may reduce our capital expenditures program and or consider the issuance of debt  equity and convertible debt instruments  if needed  for utilization for the capital expenditure program 
if we seek to raise equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures or other acquisition and development opportunities  those transactions may be affected by the market value of our common stock 
if the price of our common stock declines  our ability to utilize our stock either directly or indirectly through convertible instruments for raising capital could be negatively affected 
further  raising additional funds by issuing common stock or other types of equity securities would further dilute our existing stockholders  which 
table of contents dilution could be substantial if the price of our common stock decreases 
any securities we issue may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to our existing equity securities 
borrowing money may also involve pledging some or all of our assets 
risk factors because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
risk factors associated with our financial condition if we do not continue to meet the listing requirements of the american stock exchange  our common stock could be delisted 
the american stock exchange requires companies to fulfill certain requirements in order for their shares to continue to be listed 
the securities of a company may be considered for delisting if the company fails to meet certain financial thresholds  including if the company has sustained losses from continuing operations and or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years 
as of december   we have sustained losses in each of our last six fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that we will not report additional losses in the future or that the american stock exchange will not delist our common stock 
the potential delisting of our common stock could adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the future by issuing common stock or securities convertible into common stock 
we have a history of losses and may suffer losses in the future 
we have reported losses in each of the last six fiscal years  including a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  we have reported cumulative net losses of approximately million over the last six fiscal years 
our ability to generate net income is strongly affected by  among other factors  our ability to successfully drill undeveloped reserves as well as the market price of crude oil and natural gas 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a writedown of our oil and gas properties of approximately million primarily due to a significant reduction in our proved undeveloped reserves in colombia following the drilling of a non productive well 
if we are unsuccessful in drilling productive wells or the market price of crude oil and natural gas declines  we may report additional losses in the future 
during  we recorded a loss of approximately million related to the increase of the fair value of the liability of the global warrants held by outside parties 
consequently  future losses may adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our financial condition may suffer if estimates of its oil and gas reserve information are adjusted  and fluctuations in oil and gas prices and other factors affect our oil and gas reserves 
our oil and gas reserve information is based upon criteria mandated by the sec  and reflects only estimates of the accumulation of oil and gas and the economic recoverability of those volumes 
our future production  revenues and expenditures with respect to such oil and gas reserves could be different from estimates  and any material differences may negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may prove to differ materially from that assumed in estimating reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the production and operating costs incurred  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flow based on the same available data 
the estimated discounted future net cash flows described in this annual report for the year ended december   should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties from proved reserves 
such estimates are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  in accordance with sec requirements  while future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
the sec requires that we report its oil and natural gas reserves using the price as of the last day of the year 
using lower values in forecasting reserves will result in a shorter life being given to producing oil and natural gas properties because such properties  as their production levels are estimated to decline  will reach an uneconomic limit  with lower prices  at an earlier date 
there can be no assurance that a decrease in oil and gas prices or other differences in our estimates of its reserve will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if estimated discounted future net cash flows decrease  we may be required to take additional writedowns 
we periodically review the carrying value of its oil and gas properties under applicable full cost accounting rules 
these rules require a writedown of the carrying value of oil and gas properties if the carrying value exceeds the applicable estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline in the future  even if only for a short period of time  it is possible that additional writedowns of oil and gas properties could occur 
whether we will be required to take such a charge will depend on the prices for oil and gas at the end of any quarter and the effect of reserve additions or revisions  property sales and capital expenditures during such quarter 

table of contents lyford owns a significant amount of our common stock and exercises significant control over us 
as of march   lyford beneficially owned approximately of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock 
lyford is in a position to significantly influence decisions with respect to our direction and policies  including the election and removal of directors  mergers or other business combinations  the acquisition or disposition of our assets  future issuances of our common stock or other securities  our incurrence of debt  and the payment of dividends  if any  on our common stock  and amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
lyford s concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a future change of control 
risks associated with market conditions our stock price is volatile and the value of any investment in our common stock may fluctuate 
our stock price has been and is highly volatile  and we believe this volatility is due to  among other things the results of our drilling  current expectations of our future financial performance  commodity prices of oil and natural gas  the volatility of the market in general 
for example  the common stock price has fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share over the last three years ending december  this volatility may affect the market value of our common stock in the future 
see part ii  item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 

table of contents future sales of our common stock pursuant to outstanding registration statements may affect the market price of our common stock 
there are currently several registration statements with respect to our common stock that are effective  pursuant to which certain of our stockholders may sell shares of common stock 
any such sale of stock may also decrease the market price of our common stock 
any conversions or redemptions of our convertible notes or notes  or conversions of our series g preferred  series g preferred  series g preferred  series j preferred and series m preferred or exercise of warrants issued to holders of our series j  series l and series m preferred stock  involving a large issuance of shares of our common stock could result in a dilution of stockholders ownership percentage of our common stock and may result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock 
in addition  we may elect to issue a significant number of additional shares of common stock for financing or other purposes  which could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
we have issued shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock and may issue additional shares of preferred stock in the future 
we are permitted under our charter to issue up to million shares of preferred stock 
we can issue shares of our preferred stock in one or more series and can set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our common stockholders 
any preferred stock that we issue may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than our common stock 
at december   we had outstanding  shares of series g preferred   shares of series g preferred and  shares of series g preferred   shares of series j preferred   shares of series l preferred and  shares of series m preferred 
these shares of preferred stock have rights senior to our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation 
in addition  such preferred stock may be converted into shares of common stock  which could dilute the value of common stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
at december   each share of series g preferred  series g preferred  series g preferred  series j preferred and series m preferred  may be converted into shares of common stock at conversion prices of     and per share of common stock  respectively  for each liquidation value of a share of such preferred stock  plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends 
our domestic operating strategic plan includes the acquisition of additional reserves through business combinations 
our domestic operations have shifted from primarily an exploration and development focus to an acquisition and exploitation growth strategy 
we are seeking acquisition opportunities to expand our domestic operations and increase our oil and gas reserves in north america 
we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms 
additionally  any such future transactions may not achieve favorable financial results 
inherent in any future acquisitions are certain risks  such as the difficulty of assimilating operations and facilities of the acquired business  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following such acquisition 

table of contents future business combinations may also involve the issuance of shares of our common stock  which could have a dilutive effect on stockholders percentage ownership 
we may not have a sufficient number of authorized shares to issue in any such business combinations and we may need to obtain stockholder approval to authorize additional shares for issuance 
further  the use of shares in business combinations will reduce the number of shares available for the redemption of existing convertible notes and preferred stock 
in addition  acquisitions may require substantial financial expenditures that will need to be financed through cash flow from operations or future debt and our equity offerings  and we may not be able to acquire companies or oil and gas properties using its equity as currency 
in the case of cash acquisitions  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain debt or equity financing sufficient to fund future acquisitions of reserves 
risks associated with our operations oil and gas price fluctuations in the market may adversely affect the results of our operations 
the results of our operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for our oil and natural gas production 
substantially all of our sales of oil and natural gas are made in the spot market  or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices  and not pursuant to long term  fixed price contracts 
accordingly  the prices received for our oil and natural gas production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  governmental regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas and the overall economic environment 
significant declines in prices for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
any significant decline in prices of oil or gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
recently  the price of oil and natural gas has been volatile 
for example  during  the price for a bbl of oil ranged from a high of to a low of and the price for a mcf of gas ranged from a high of to a low of 
during  based on nymex pricing  the price for a bbl of oil ranged from a high of to a low of and the price for a mcf of gas ranged from a high of to a low of 
our operations require significant expenditures of capital that may not be recovered 
we require significant expenditures of capital in order to locate and acquire producing properties and to drill exploratory and exploitation wells 
in conducting exploration  exploitation and development activities from a particular well  the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations  miscalculations or accidents may cause our exploration  exploitation  development and production activities to be unsuccessful  potentially resulting in abandoning the well 
this could result in a total loss of our investment 
in addition  the cost and timing of drilling  completing and operating wells is difficult to predict 
the oil and gas we produce may not be readily marketable at the time of production 
crude oil  natural gas  condensate and other oil and gas products are generally sold to other oil and gas companies  government agencies and other industries 
the availability of ready markets for oil and gas that we 
table of contents might discover and the prices obtained for such oil and gas depend on many factors beyond our control  including the extent of local production and imports of oil and gas  the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities  fluctuating demand for oil and gas  the marketing of competitive fuels  and the effects of governmental regulation of oil and gas production and sales 
natural gas associated with oil production is often not marketable due to demand or transportation limitations and is often flared at the producing well site 
pipeline facilities do not exist in certain areas of exploration and  therefore  any actual sales of discovered oil and gas might be delayed for extended periods until such facilities are constructed 
we may suffer losses through futures trading 
through our investment in iba  we are investing capital in the trading of energy futures contracts 
the results of these investments can be significantly impacted by factors such as the volatility of the relationship between the value of futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodity  counterparty contract defaults  and general volatility of the capital markets 
the changes in the market value of such futures contracts may fluctuate significantly from time to time  and gains or losses on any particular futures contract may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations 
we may encounter operating hazards that may result in substantial losses 
we are subject to operating hazards normally associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  explosions  oil spills  cratering  pollution  earthquakes  labor disruptions and fires 
the occurrence of any such operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life and damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells  formations  production facilities or other properties 
we maintain insurance coverage limiting financial loss resulting from certain of these operating hazards 
we do not maintain full insurance coverage for all matters that may adversely affect our operations  including war  terrorism  nuclear reactions  government fines  treatment of waste  blowout expenses and business interruptions 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 
there can be no assurance that any insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities associated with operational hazards 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance  or its availability at premium levels that justify its purchase 
drilling oil and gas wells particularly in certain regions of the united states and foreign countries could be hindered by hurricanes  earthquakes and other weather related operating risks 
our operations in the texas and louisiana gulf coast area and in colombia  peru and panama are subject to risks from hurricanes and other natural disasters 
damage caused by hurricanes  earthquakes or other 
table of contents operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us 
for example  during our domestic operations were affected by hurricane ivan resulting in reduced oil and gas volumes in the fourth quarter of we face strong competition from larger oil and gas companies  which could result in adverse effects on our business 
the exploration  exploitation and production business is highly competitive 
many of our competitors have substantially larger financial resources  staffs and facilities 
our competitors in the united states include numerous major oil and gas exploration and production companies and in colombia  peru and panama include such major oil and gas companies as bp amoco  exxon mobil  texaco shell and conoco phillips 
these major oil and gas companies are often better positioned to obtain the rights to exploratory acreage for which we compete 
our operations are subject to various litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 
from time to time our subsidiaries are defendants in various litigation matters 
the nature of our and our subsidiaries operations expose us to further possible litigation claims in the future 
there is risk that any matter in litigation could be adversely decided against us or our subsidiaries  regardless of our belief  opinion and position  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
litigation is highly costly and the costs associated with defending litigation could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
compliance with  or breach of  environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations 
our operations are subject to numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
we own or lease  and have in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas and these properties and the wastes disposed on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the oil pollution act of  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously released wastes or property contamination 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and  may in some cases  impose strict liability for environmental damage 
strict liability means that we may be held liable for damage without regard to whether we were negligent or otherwise at fault 
environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with existing requirements of governmental bodies  our ability to conduct continued operations is subject to satisfying applicable regulatory and permitting controls 
our current permits and authorizations and ability to get future permits and authorizations  particularly in foreign countries  may be susceptible  on a going forward basis  to increased scrutiny  greater complexity resulting in increased costs  or delays in receiving appropriate authorizations 
in 
table of contents particular  we have experienced and may continue to experience delays in obtaining permits and authorization in colombia necessary for our operations 
we are required to obtain an environmental permit or approval from the governments in colombia  peru and panama prior to conducting seismic operations  drilling a well or constructing a pipeline in such foreign locations 
our operations in foreign countries have been delayed in the past and could be delayed in the future through the process of obtaining an environmental permit 
compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs of operations  as well as further restrict our foreign operations 
our foreign operations involve substantial costs and are subject to certain risks because the oil and gas industries in such countries are less developed 
the oil and gas industries in colombia  peru and panama are not as developed as the oil and gas industry in the united states 
as a result  our drilling and development operations in many instances take longer to complete and often cost more than similar operations in the united states 
the availability of technical expertise  specific equipment and supplies is more limited in colombia  peru and panama than in the united states 
we expect that such factors will continue to subject our international operations to economic and operating risks not experienced in our domestic operations 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development of oil and gas reserves in which all of our acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized 
costs related to the acquisition  holding and initial exploration of oil and gas associated with our contracts in countries with no proved reserves are initially capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
if we abandon all exploration efforts in a country where no proved reserves are assigned  all acquisition and exploration costs associated with the country are expensed 
from time to time  we make assessments as to whether our investment within a country is impaired and whether exploration activities within a country will be abandoned based on our analysis of drilling results  seismic data and other information we believe to be relevant 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expenses are difficult to predict 
if we fail to comply with the terms of certain contracts related to our foreign operations  we could lose our rights under each of those contracts 
the terms of each of the colombian association and exploration and production contracts  the peruvian license agreement and the anticipated panamanian concession contract require that we perform certain activities  such as seismic interpretations and the drilling of required wells  in accordance with those contracts and agreements 
our failure to timely perform those activities as required could result in the loss of our rights under a particular contract  which would likely result in a significant loss to us 
as of march   we were in compliance with the requirements of each of the existing association and concession contracts 
we require significant additional financing for our foreign operations  which financing may not be available 
we anticipate that full development of our existing and future oil and gas discoveries and prospects in colombia  peru and panama may take several years and require significant additional capital expenditures 
if we are unable to timely obtain adequate funds to finance these investments  our ability to develop oil and gas reserves in these countries may be severely limited or substantially delayed 
such limitations or delay would likely result in substantial losses 

table of contents we anticipate that amounts required to fund our foreign activities  conducted primarily through our ownership of global  will be funded from existing cash balances  operating cash flows  third party financing and from joint venture partners 
the exact usage of other future funding sources is unknown at this time  and there can be no assurance that global will have adequate funds available to finance our foreign operations 
our foreign operations are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties 
our subsidiary  global  currently conducts significant operations in colombia  peru and panama and may also conduct operations in other foreign countries in the future 
at december   approximately of our consolidated proved reserve volumes and of our consolidated revenues were related to global s colombian operations 
exploration and production operations in foreign countries are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties  including the risk of war  revolution  border disputes  expropriation  renegotiation or modification of existing contracts  import  export and transportation regulations and tariffs resulting in loss of revenue  property and equipment  taxation policies  including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims  exchange controls  currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over international operations  laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment  and the possibility of being subjected to the jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states 
central and south america have a history of political and economic instability 
this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies  laws or regulations that might assume a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment 
in an extreme case  such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreign owned assets 
any such activity could result in a significant loss to global 
guerrilla activity in colombia could disrupt or delay global s operations  and we are concerned about safeguarding global s operations and personnel in colombia 
colombia s year armed conflict between the government and leftist guerrilla groups has escalated in recent years 
the current government has taken a strong approach against the guerilla movement after peace overtures by the preceding colombian administration failed 
the increased military action by the colombian government directed against the rebel groups operating in colombia may result in escalated guerilla activity 
also  the increased activity of right wing paramilitary groups  formed in opposition to the left wing guerilla groups  has contributed to the escalation in violence 
the increase in violence has affected business interests in 
table of contents colombia 
targeting such enterprises as symbols of foreign exploitation  particularly in the north of the country  the rebel groups have attempted to hamper production of hydrocarbons 
the cumulative effect of escalation in the armed conflict and the resulting unstable political and security situation has led to increased risks and costs and the downgrading of colombia s country risk rating 
global s oil and gas operations are in areas outside guerrilla control and with the exception of its increased security requirements  our operations continue mostly unaffected  although from time to time  guerilla activity in colombia has delayed our projects there 
this guerilla activity has increased over the last few years  causing delays in the development of our fields in colombia 
guerilla activity  such as road blockades  has also from time to time slowed our deployment of workers in the field and affected our operations 
in addition  guerillas could attempt to disrupt the flow of our production through pipelines 
in addition to these security issues  we have also become the subject of media focus in colombia that may further compromise our security position in the country 
there can be no assurance that attempts to reduce or prevent guerilla activity will be successful or that guerilla activity will not disrupt global s operations in the future 
there can also be no assurance that global can maintain the safety of its operations and personnel in colombia or that this violence will not affect its operations in the future 
continued or heightened security concerns in colombia could also result in a significant loss to us 
the united states government may impose economic or trade sanctions on colombia that could result in a significant loss to us 
colombia is among several nations whose progress in stemming the production and transit of illegal drugs is subject to annual certification by the president of the united states 
although colombia was so certified in  there can be no assurance that  in the future  colombia will receive certification or a national interest waiver 
the failure to receive certification or a national interest waiver may result in any of the following all bilateral aid  except anti narcotics and humanitarian aid  would be suspended  the export import bank of the united states and the overseas private investment corporation would not approve financing for new projects in colombia  united states representatives at multilateral lending institutions would be required to vote against all loan requests from colombia  although such votes would not constitute vetoes  and the president of the united states and congress would retain the right to apply future trade sanctions 
each of these consequences could result in adverse economic consequences in colombia and could further heighten the political and economic risks associated with our operations there 
any changes in the holders of significant government offices could have adverse consequences on our relationship with the colombian national oil company and the colombian government s ability to control guerrilla activities and could exacerbate the factors relating to our foreign operations discussed above 
any sanctions imposed on colombia by the united states government could threaten our ability to obtain necessary financing to develop the colombian properties or cause colombia to retaliate against us  including by nationalizing our colombian assets 
accordingly  the imposition of the foregoing economic and trade sanctions on colombia would likely 
table of contents result in a substantial loss and a decrease in the price of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that the united states will not impose sanctions on colombia in the future or predict the effect in colombia that these sanctions might cause 
we may suffer losses from exchange rate fluctuations 
we accounts for its colombian  peruvian and panamanian operations using the us dollar as the functional currency 
the costs associated with our exploration efforts in colombia  peru and panama have typically been denominated in us dollars 
a portion of colombian revenues are denominated in colombian pesos 
to the extent that the amount of our revenues denominated in colombian pesos is greater than the amount of costs denominated in colombian pesos  we could suffer a loss if the value of the colombian peso were to drop relative to the value of the us dollar 
any substantial currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in recent years the value of the colombian peso relative to the us dollar has declined 
for example  the average exchange rate for the colombian peso into us dollars for december was  as compared to an average of for december and for december 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from movements in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
as part of an overall risk management strategy  we use derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce risks associated with these factors 
commodity price risk we are a producer of hydrocarbon commodities  including crude oil  condensate and natural gas 
we use oil and gas derivative financial instruments  limited to collars and floors with maturities of months or less  to mitigate our exposure of fluctuations in oil and gas commodity prices on future crude oil and natural gas production 
we have evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in commodity prices would have had on the fair value of its commodity price risk sensitive financial instruments at year end in september  we purchased a crude oil floor contract with a strike price of per barrel for a notional amount of  barrels per month over a contract period from january  through december  we designated the above derivative as a hedge of the exposure to variability of cash flows related to forecasted sales of specified production from certain of our domestic property operations 
such crude oil floor contract is reflected in prepaid expenses and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december  with a fair value of approximately  in october  we purchased a natural gas floor contract with a strike price of per mmbtu for a notional amount of  mmbtus per month over the period of the contract from january  to december  we designated this derivative as a hedge under sfas at december   this hedge no longer qualified for hedge accounting treatment under sfas this natural gas floor contract is reflected in prepaid expenses and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet at december  with a market value of approximately  interest rate risk consistent with the prior year  we invest cash in interest bearing temporary investments of high quality issuers 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a significant interest rate risk to us 
consistent with the prior year  we consider our interest rate risk exposure related to long term debt obligations to not be material 
at december  all of our financing obligations carry a fixed interest rate per annum 
we have no open interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk consistent with the prior year  global conducts international business in colombia and is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses and capital expenditures that are denominated in colombian pesos 
however  because predominately all material transactions in global s existing foreign operations are denominated in us dollars  the us dollar is the functional currency for all operations 
consistent with the prior year  exposure from transactions in currencies other than us dollars is not considered material
