item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect future results the following information  including  without limitation  the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk that are not historical facts  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements generally are characterized by the use of terms such as believe  expect and may 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  the company s actual results could differ materially from these set forth in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include loss of a major customer 
in  one customer accounted for approximately and another customer of the company s sales  and at december   one of these customers accounted for of the company s accounts receivable 
a loss of either customer would have a major adverse impact on the company s results 
product demand fluctuations in the timing and volume of customer requests for its products 
telecommunication systems industry and general economic conditions 
competitive pressure on selling prices 
market acceptance of the company s products and its customer s products and services 
costs associated with possible litigation or settlement  including those related to the use or ownership of intellectual property 
third party suppliers increase the risk that the company may not have adequate supply to meet demand 
introduction of new products 
the company s markets are subject to technological change  so its success depends on its ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive 
some of its competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources 
the company s future success is dependent on its ability to attract and retain key design engineering  sales and executive personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel  in particular  design engineers  and the company may not be able to attract and retain engineers and other qualified personnel necessary for the development and introduction of new products or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel that may leave its employ 
expense levels  in the short term  are fixed 
sales variances from quarter to quarter would have a significant effect on the results of operations 
other risk factors detailed in this annual report on form k and in the company s other securities and exchange commission filings 
given the uncertainties  the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
executive summary the company operates in two segments 
in the united states  the company designs  manufactures and sells voice processing equipment for use in telephone central offices 
in europe united kingdom  the company distributes equipment and software for use in customer s premises  primarily contact centers 
in the united states  the company s products include intelligent announcers and network media servers 
these products facilitate the deployment of voice resources in service providers networks  both traditional circuit switched networks  as well as the next generation of packet based networks 
beginning in  expenditures for network development decreased significantly reflecting a decline in the competitive local exchange carrier market and reduced capital spending by large service providers 
this trend intensified in and continued into the company believes that the market for telecommunication equipment has stabilized and is growing in certain areas  but the timing of such spending continues to be uncertain and may be adversely impacted by mergers and acquisitions among telecommunication service providers 
established service providers are looking for ways to offer additional features on their legacy networks while they institute a multi year plan to transition to ip based multimedia services 
to effectively compete  the company must expand its penetration in the market  increase the application available on its intelligent peripherals and media servers and increase the capacity of its media servers 
in the united kingdom  the company distributes products primarily used in contact centers 
over the last several years  this market has declined due to market saturation  general economic conditions  increased competition and the relocation of large call centers to less developed countries 
the company believes that in this trend has leveled off 
to return to profitability  the company has to expand its product offerings to introduce new products  not only to the contact center market  but also to new markets 
capital spending in the markets the company serves can vary over a short period of time and change rapidly 
in addition  the company faces intense competition from larger and better financed competitors and one customer accounts for a significant portion of the company s revenue 
as a result  the company s performance is subject to large fluctuations 
because of these uncertainties  it is difficult for the company to make accurate short and long term projections of results of operations and cash flow 
as discussed more fully throughout the management s discussion and analysis results of operations improved in due to increased revenues and improved gross margin percentage  calculated as revenues less cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue 
revenues increased in due to improved sales in the company s domestic operations 
gross margin percentage increased from in to in results the company reported net losses of 
million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  revenues increased million from levels primarily due to an increase in the sales of the company s domestic operations of million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of the cx to a large domestic telecommunication service provider 
sales to this customer increased million in from  continuing a trend commenced in the company expects that it will receive additional substantive orders from this customer in this customer is using this equipment in its advanced intelligent network ain to provide services to their subscribers 
in addition  the increased revenues also resulted from an increase in service revenue resulting from the commencement of software and hardware maintenance agreements with a large customer 
the company anticipates this amount will increase in future years 
the uk distributorship operations sales only increased 
million in spite of favorable exchange variance of due to lower volume 
to offset this decrease  the company has introduced additional products to the contact center market 
the company s consolidated backlog at december  was million versus 
million in in both and  a major portion of the company s domestic revenue came from one customer and a major portion of the uk distributorship s revenue came from another customer 
the loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse impact on the company 
in  sales decreased million from the sales of the company s domestic operations declined 
million reflecting the industry wide trend of reduced capital spending 
the decrease in sales was in both the direct and indirect channels with the exception of sales of cx o a large domestic telecommunication service provider 
sales to this customer increased million in from the prior year 
the uk distributorship operation decreased 
million in from the prior year  in spite of a favorable foreign currency fluctuation of 
in addition  sales to its largest customer increased in from decreases in sales to its other customers more than offset these improvements 
consolidated gross margin was in  in and in included in cost of products sold were inventory obsolescence charges of 
million in and 
million in and fixed asset impairment and inventory obsolescence charges of million in the improved gross margin percentage was primarily due to increased sales volume and improved product mix in the domestic operations 
the increased sales for the domestic operations in was for equipment used in an ain environment 
this equipment has a higher sales price resulting in a higher gross margin percentage 
research and development decreased 
million in and 
million in from the prior year 
the decrease in primarily reflects lower personnel costs and in primarily reflects lower contract engineering services and lower personnel costs 
the company anticipates increasing research and development expense in selling  general and administrative expense decreased 
million in and from the prior year period 
in  domestic operations decreased 
million due to lower professional fees and personnel costs offset by an increase of 
in the uk operations due to exchange rate variance 
the decrease in was due to a 
million decrease in the us operations primarily reflecting lower personnel costs offset by an increase of 
million in the uk primarily reflecting exchange rate variance 
other income of million in includes a non cash gain of 
million on the termination of the company s postretirement health benefits plan 
other income of 
million in  
million in and 
million in is primarily interest income 
the company s effective tax rate for was  for was and for deferred tax valuation allowances of 
million in  million in and million in were included in tax expense 
forming a conclusion that such an allowance is not needed is difficult when there is evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
the provision for income taxes is discussed in note h to the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of inflation has not had a significant impact on the operating results of the company over the past few years 
technological advances and productivity improvements are continually being applied to reduce costs  thus reducing inflationary pressures on the operating results of the company 
exchange rate changes will impact the reported dollar sales and cost of sales of the company s uk distributorship operations 
in addition  at december   the company s uk distributorship operations had net assets of million  which would be impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
however  the impact of such rate change would be reflected in the translation adjustment recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the company does not hedge this foreign currency net asset exposure 
total rental expense amounted to  in   in and  in future annual payments for long term noncancellable leases for each of the five years in the period ending december  are approximately     and  respectively  and thereafter 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
liquidity and sources of capital net cash used by operations was  in  million in and million in the reduction in use of cash by operations in versus and is due to the improvement in operating results 
cash used provided by investing activities was 
in  million in and million in the company has net sales of marketable securities of 
million in and million in versus net purchases of million in there were purchases of property  plant and equipment and software of 
million  
million and 
million in  and  respectively 
included in were loans to officers  net of repayments  of 
million 
working capital was million at december   million at december  and million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  versus at december  and at december  the decreases in working capital in and from the prior year is due to the net loss 
the company s contractual obligations are as follows amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than more than contractual obligation year years years years operating leases  the company anticipates making capital expenditures of approximately 
million  increasing the current level of expenditures for research and development and may repurchase up to  shares of its common stock in based on current operating results  management believes that the cash and cash equivalents at december  will be sufficient to fund the company s cash requirements for and and for subsequent years  however  if the company s operations deteriorate due to increased competition  loss of a large customer or otherwise  it may be required to obtain additional sources of funds through asset sales  capital market transactions or financing from third parties or a combination thereof 
the company cannot provide assurances that these additional sources of funds will be available or  if available  what the terms would be 
assumptions and estimates used in critical accounting policies in the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management must make critical decisions regarding accounting policies and judgments regarding their application 
materially different amounts could be reported under different circumstances and conditions 
revenue we generally recognize product revenue  net of sales discounts and allowances  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment or delivery dependent upon the terms of the sale has occurred  all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  the amount is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable 
sales of services and system support are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence due to a prolonged slow down in spending by telecommunication service providers  inventory turnover has slowed 
the company recorded charges of 
million  
million and million  and  respectively  to reduce its carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market 
if future capital expenditures by telecommunication service providers do not increase or decrease further  additional charges may be required 
deferred tax assets as of december   the company has a valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets 
in making such a determination  the company considers its current and past performance  the market environment in which it operates  estimated future earnings  tax planning strategies and other factors 
in the future  as these factors change  a change in the valuation reserve may be required 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension income expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
over the long term  the company s pension plan assets have earned in excess of  therefore  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of is reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of gains losses are amortized to expense in accordance with sfas no 
the plan assets earned a rate of return less than the assumed rate of return in and in excess of the assumed rate of return in at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
at december   the company used a rate of 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas no 
item a market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company s marketable securities consist of short term and or variable rate instruments and therefore a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of these securities
