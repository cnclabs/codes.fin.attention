recent developments during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company conducted a review of its lease accounting practices 
as a result of the review  the company revised its lease accounting policies to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
historically  the company followed a practice in which it computed straight line rent expense for the current term of the lease only  while depreciating buildings and leasehold improvements over longer periods 
the company has revised its lease accounting policies to recognize rent expense  including rent escalations  on a straight line basis over the reasonably assured lease term  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
additionally  the company modified its accounting to depreciate buildings and leasehold improvements over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the reasonably assured lease term 
as a result of this accounting revision  the company restated its financial statements for prior periods 
the impact of the restatement on periods prior to has been reflected as a reduction of retained earnings of million as of march  the effect of the restatement on fiscal years and was to increase rent and depreciation expense reported in cost of sales by million and million  respectively and to reduce net income by million in fiscal and million in fiscal from the amounts previously reported 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this accounting revision 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the accounting policies listed below are those that are most critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that required management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 
inventory the company evaluates whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and the company believes inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  historically the company has been able to return excess items to vendors for credit 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require a revision in the estimates 
carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the amount paid in consideration for an acquisition in excess of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company does not amortize goodwill for acquisitions made after june  for acquisitions prior to that date  the company continued to amortize goodwill only through the end of fiscal the company conducts tests for impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
these impairment tests include management estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including growth rates  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact the estimated fair value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that an asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the company evaluates the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used in the business by reviewing undiscounted cash flows by operating unit 
such evaluations are performed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such instances  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and the carrying values 
additionally  in the case of fixed assets related to locations that will be closed or sold  the company shortens the depreciable life of the related assets to coincide with the planned sale or closing date 
self insurance reserves the company is largely self insured with respect to workers compensation  general liability and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce its risk and better manage its overall loss exposure  the company purchases stop loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts 
the company maintains an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates take into consideration the historical average claim volume  the average cost for settled claims  current trends in claim costs  changes in the company s business and workforce  and general economic factors 
these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review is warranted 
warranty the company provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to sales  except for tire road hazard warranties which are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin the warranty reserve and warranty expense related to all product warranties at and for the fiscal years ended march and were not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased million  or to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase of approximately million from stores added since march   of which the acquired mr 
tire stores accounted for million 
comparable store sales increased 
there were selling days in fiscal year compared to selling days in fiscal year during the year  stores were added and four were closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
management believes that the improvement in sales resulted from several factors aimed at driving store traffic  including an increase in the number of oil changes performed and an increase in scheduled maintenance services 
price increases in several product categories also contributed to the sales improvement 
the company introduced scheduled maintenance services in all of its stores late in fiscal these services are required by vehicle manufacturers to comply with warranty schedules  and are offered by monro in a more convenient and cost competitive fashion than auto dealers can provide 
management believes that these services  which are offered both in bundled packages and individually  will continue to contribute positively to comparable store sales in future years  and have helped to mitigate the decline in exhaust which negatively impacted recent fiscal years 
the exhaust decline resulted primarily from manufacturers use of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems on most new cars beginning in the mid s and completed in the mid s 
additionally  the company continued to reward store employees with pay programs focused on high customer service scores 
management believes that  in spite of the sluggish economic environment  it is continuing to build the trust of its customers  through quality  integrity and fair pricing  and is gaining an advantage over some of its competitors 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to an increase in material costs due to a shift in mix to the lower margin categories of tires and maintenance services 
included in the maintenance categories are oil changes which increased approximately on a comparable store basis over the prior year 
the company promoted oil changes to drive traffic during the year  by slightly lowering the selling price in the second half of fiscal  while experiencing an increase in the cost of oil 
this had the effect of lowering margin in the maintenance category as compared to the prior year 
additionally  transmission and coolant flushes increased in fiscal over on a comparable store basis  partially due to increased emphasis by management and increased selling prices 
however  price increases  as well as the recognition of vendor rebates against cost of goods in concert with inventory turns in accordance with eitf  helped to partially offset the aforementioned margin pressures 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in technician labor and occupancy costs  which are included in cost of sales 
technician labor costs decreased due to better operational control and improved productivity 
additionally  the increase in tire sales  which carry lower labor costs as compared to other service categories  helped to decrease labor costs as a percent of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales in fiscal also decreased as compared to fiscal  as the company  with improved sales  was able to leverage these largely fixed costs 
without mr 
tire s results  gross profit increased from last year to this year  partially due to a reduction in total material costs  as well as through increased leveraging of distribution and occupancy costs 
the improvement in material costs apart from the acquired mr 
tire stores  was due primarily to a reduction in outside purchases 
the company has continued to add inventory to its stores and warehouses in fiscal in a concerted effort to reduce outbuys 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million to million and  as a percentage of sales  remained flat as compared to fiscal the increase in expenditures is primarily due to the store direct costs associated with new stores  as well as increased store manager wages to improve the quality and retention of this highly important position for the company  increased insurance costs  increased expense to comply with sarbanes oxley requirements and increased utility costs 
operating income in fiscal of million  or of sales  increased by million from the fiscal level of million  due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased as a percent of sales from 
in fiscal to 
in fiscal the weighted average debt outstanding for the year ended march  increased by approximately million from fiscal largely offsetting this increase was a decrease in the weighted average interest rate for the year ended march  of approximately 
from the rate of for the year ended march   resulting in a slight decrease in expense between the two years

at march   the company had stores and kiosk locations in operation 
management believes that the improvement in sales resulted from several factors aimed at driving store traffic  including an increase in the number of oil changes performed  an increase in scheduled maintenance services and an increase in commercial fleet business 
price increases in areas such as shop supply and environmental fees  as well as in several product categories  also contributed to the sales improvement 
additionally  after six fiscal years of declines in comparable store exhaust sales  exhaust sales leveled off in fiscal the exhaust decline had resulted primarily from manufacturers use beginning in the mid s and completed in the mid s of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems on almost all new cars  which has extended the life of exhaust systems and resulted in declining exhaust sales 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to a decline in technician labor costs as well as distribution and occupancy costs which are included in cost of sales 
technician labor costs decreased due to better operational control and improved productivity  as measured by sales per man hour 
since the company began formally tracking this statistic over the last seven years  productivity has increased every year  and since fiscal  is up 
the decrease in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales is largely due to the buyout of the synthetic lease properties which occurred on june  as a result of this transaction  approximately 
million of expense  which formerly was recorded as rent expense and included in cost of sales  was recorded as interest expense during the year 
there was also an additional million of expense recorded as rent in the prior year which did not recur in fy due to a the buyout of several synthetic lease properties in march and b a reduction in interest rates in fy the interest rate reduction occurred with the expiration of swap agreements mid year 
additionally  there was a reduction in the spread over libor which the company pays  resulting from the company s improved financial performance  as well as the elimination of the synthetic lease lessor 
this reduction was partially offset by approximately 
million of additional depreciation recognized during the year  now that the related properties are recorded on the company s balance sheet 
additionally  with strong comparable store sales  the company was able to obtain some leverage in occupancy costs which are largely fixed expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in material usage partially related to a shift in mix  which includes a greater percentage of higher cost tire sales  an increase in oil costs and an increase in parts purchased outside of the company s normal distribution system outside purchases 
these parts carry much higher costs than parts which the company purchases directly from manufacturers and distributes through its central distribution system 
due to parts proliferation and the company s expansion into more services  having the correct mix of inventory in the stores is a challenge that the company works very hard to master in order to control its cost of sales 
while the company  which purchases approximately of parts outside its normal distribution system  has performed better than many of its competitors  which experience upwards of outside purchases  it is not satisfied with these results and remains focused on reducing outside purchases from current levels 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million to million and  as a percentage of sales  decreased by as compared to fiscal the increase in expenditures is primarily due to increased store manager wages to improve the quality and retention of this highly important position for the company  increased workers compensation costs  increased expense to comply with sarbanes oxley requirements and increased utility costs
