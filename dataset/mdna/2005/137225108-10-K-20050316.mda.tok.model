table of contents our principal activities are oil and gas exploration  development and production  principally in the republic of georgia  and to a lesser extent through our minority ownership interest in non consolidated investees in kazakhstan 
during  we disposed of our oil and gas interests in ukraine 
also  in  we disposed of our petroleum product marketing and refining activities in georgia 
to date  we continue to direct most of our efforts and resources to the development of our georgian exploration program  the development of the ninotsminda field in georgia and in the development of the samgori field in georgia in which we acquired an interest in april 
exploration  development and production activities in georgia our exploration  development and production activities are carried out under five production sharing contracts and agreements collectively  psc  these being the ninotsminda  manavi and west rustavi production sharing contract  covering block xi e  ninotsminda psc  in which ninotsminda oil company limited owns a interest

the remaining profit petroleum produced from the project is delivered to the state from which the state will assume  pay and discharge  in the name and on behalf of each contractor party  the contractor party s profit tax liability and all other host states taxes  levies and duties 
pscs are a common form of oil and gas exploration and production contract in many parts of the world 

table of contents map ninotsminda and samgori fields since completion of the business combination with canargo oil gas inc  our resources have  through our wholly owned subsidiary ninotsminda oil company limited  been focused on the development of the ninotsminda field and related exploration activities 
the ninotsminda field covers approximately  acres km and is located approximately miles kms north east of the georgian capital  tbilisi 
it is adjacent to and east of the samgori oil field  which was georgia s most productive oil field and in which we acquired an interest in early the ninotsminda field was discovered later than the samgori field and has experienced substantially less development activity 
georgian oil and others  including ninotsminda oil company limited  have drilled wells in the ninotsminda field  of which nine are currently producing 
a total of wells have been drilled in the samgori field area which includes a complex of three separate oil accumulations namely samgori  south dome and patardzeuli 
we have been advised that samgori prior to our ownership interest has produced over mmbbl of oil since at rates of up to  bopd 
nineteen wells are currently producing from the samgori complex 
we believe both the ninotsminda and samgori psc areas both outside of and beneath the currently producing reservoirs of these fields have significant additional exploration potential 
to date  we have invested substantial funds in exploring the ninotsminda psc area 
other projects we also have additional exploratory and developmental oil and gas properties and prospects in georgia and we own interests in other oil and gas projects in the former soviet union through our minority ownerships investment in non consolidated investees 
during  we disposed of our single remaining ukrainian asset  the bugruvativske field  in order to focus on our business in georgia 
our principal product is crude oil  and the sale of crude oil and crude oil products is our principal source of revenue 

table of contents business structure canargo is a holding company organized under the laws of the state of delaware and its principal active subsidiaries are as follows chart background ninotsminda psc our activities at the ninotsminda field are conducted through ninotsminda oil company limited  a cypriot corporation noc 
initially we had a partner in noc named jkx oil gas plc jkx however in may  we reached an agreement with jkx to acquire its final interest in noc 
in july  this transaction was completed and noc became our wholly owned subsidiary 

table of contents noc then named jkx ninotsminda limited obtained its rights to the ninotsminda field  including all existing wells  one other field and exploration acreage in block xi e under a production sharing contract with georgian oil and the state of georgia ninotsminda psc which came into effect in february noc s rights under the contract expire in december  subject to the possible loss of undeveloped areas prior to that date and a possible extension with regard to developed areas 
as such the initial term of the ninotsminda psc is until  however  in respect of any development area  if commercial production remains possible beyond upon giving notice to the state we have an automatic right to extend the contract in respect of such development area for an additional term of years until or  if earlier  for the producing life of the development area 
under the ninotsminda psc  noc is required to relinquish at least half of the area then covered by the production sharing contract  but not in portions being actively developed  at five year intervals commencing december in  these terms were amended with the initial relinquishment being due in and a reduction in the area to be relinquished at each interval from to 
under the ninotsminda psc  up to of petroleum produced under the contract production is allocated to noc for the recovery of the cumulative allowable capital  operating and other project costs associated with the ninotsminda field and exploration in block xi e 
noc pays of the costs incurred in the project as the sole contractor party under the ninotsminda psc 
the balance of production is allocated on a basis between georgian oil and noc respectively 
while noc continues to have unrecovered costs  it will receive of production profit petroleum 
after recovery of its cumulative capital  operating and other allowable project costs  noc will receive of production 
thus  while noc is responsible for all of the costs associated with the ninotsminda psc  it is only entitled to receive of production after cost recovery 
the allocation of a share of production to georgian oil  however  relieves noc of all obligations it would otherwise have to pay the republic of georgia for taxes  duties and levies related to activities covered by the production sharing contract 
georgian oil and noc take their respective shares of oil production in kind  and they market their oil independently  however the intention is to market gas jointly 
until the end of  georgian oil had a priority right to receive oil representing a projection of what the ninotsminda field would have yielded based upon the wells and equipment in use at the time the contract was entered into 
this priority right has now ceased 
samgori psc in april  we acquired a interest in the samgori psc in georgia 
this interest was acquired from georgian oil samgori limited gosl  a company wholly owned by georgian oil  by one of our subsidiaries  canargo samgori limited csl 
under the terms of the agreement dated january   up to horizontal wells will be drilled on the samgori field 
completion of well s in the autumn of  which was funded by us  satisfied our commitment to gosl under the acquisition agreement 
the intention is that the remainder of the drilling program will be funded jointly by csl and gosl  the contractor parties  pro rata their interest in the samgori psc 
the total cost to us of participating in the whole program  which is due to be completed within months of the commencement of the joint work program  is anticipated to be up to  the samgori psc came into effect on september  and extends for an initial period of twenty years with the final year of the contract being september  this period may be extended subject to commercial production being available for up to a further fifteen years until the original contractor party to the samgori psc  national petroleum limited npl  has an option to reacquire its contractor s interest in the samgori psc and its interest in the operating company in the event that the agreed work program is not completed in part within months of the work commencement date which is expected to be set within the next two months and completed in full within months of the work commencement date 
furthermore  npl has outstanding costs and expenses of  in relation to the samgori psc which are recoverable by npl receiving of annual net profit from the field until such costs have been fully repaid 
under the samgori psc  up to of petroleum produced under the contract is allocated to the contractor parties for the recovery of the cumulative allowable capital  operating and other project costs associated with the samgori field and exploration in block xi b cost recovery oil 
the cost recovery pool includes the  costs previously incurred by npl 
the balance of production profit oil is allocated on a basis between the state and the 
table of contents contractor parties respectively 
while gosl and csl continue to have unrecovered costs  they will receive of total production net to us 
after recovery of their cumulative capital  operating and other allowable project costs including the npl costs  the contractor parties will receive of profit oil net to us 
as with our other pscs  the allocation of a share of production to the state relieves the contractor parties of all obligations they would otherwise have to pay the republic of georgia for taxes  duties and levies related to activities covered by the samgori psc 
after npl s costs are repaid from either field production or other production in the psc in the event that new fields are developed in areas identified using seismic surveys originally performed by npl  npl shall continue to receive of annual net profit 
under the samgori psc  georgian oil as the state representative in the contract is entitled to receive up to  tons approximately million barrels of oil base level oil from a maximum of per calendar quarter of production when the value of the cumulative cost recovery petroleum  cumulative profit oil and cumulative profit natural gas delivered to the contractor parties exceeds the cumulative allowable capital  operating and other project costs including finance costs associated with the samgori field and exploration in block xi b and the npl costs 
while base level oil is being delivered to georgian oil  the contractor parties will continue to be entitled to a maximum of of the remaining profit oil 
the base level oil is an estimate of the amount of oil that georgian oil would have expected to produce from the contract area had the state not come to a contractual arrangement with the previous contractor party in pursuant to the terms of canargo s pscs in georgia  including the ninotsminda and samgori pscs  a georgian not for profit company must be appointed as field operator 
until recently  there were four such field operating companies  relating to canargo s five pscs georgian british oil company ninotsminda  georgian british oil company nazvrevi and georgian british oil company norio in respect of both the norio psa and the tbilisi psc  each of which is owned by a company within the canargo group with the remainder owned by georgian oil  but with canargo having chairmanship of the board and a casting vote  the field operator for the samgori psc  ioris valley oil and gas  is currently owned by georgian oil and a subsidiary of georgian oil  georgian oil samgori limited  but canargo  under its farm in agreement to the samgori psc  has a right to acquire a controlling interest in this company for one us dollar 
however  on february  georgian oil  the state agency for regulation of oil and gas resources in georgia and canargo reached agreement on restructuring the field operator companies in our pscs 
a single operator company  canargo georgia limited  a wholly owned subsidiary company of canargo  was appointed the field operator for the ninotsminda  nazvrevi  norio and tbilisi pscs 
we are currently in the process of moving the operatorship of the samgori psc to a canargo controlled company 
the field operator provides the operating personnel and is responsible for day to day operations 
canargo or a company within the canargo group together with any other contractor party in the contracts such as in the samgori psc pays the operating company s expenses associated with the development of the fields  and the operating company performs its services on a non profit basis 
operations under each of the pscs are determined by a co ordinating body co ordinating committee composed of members designated by the respective canargo company and georgian oil  representing the state  with the deciding vote allocated to us 
if georgian oil believes that any action proposed by us with which georgian oil disagrees would result in permanent damage to a field or reservoir or in a material reduction in production over the life of a field or reservoir  it may refer the disagreement to a western independent expert for binding resolution 
since we acquired our interest in the pscs  there has been no such disagreement 
georgian regulatory authorities must approve any drilling sites tentatively selected by us before drilling may commence 
ninotsminda  manavi and west rustavi production sharing contract ninotsminda the ninotsminda field was discovered in  with commercial production from the middle eocene reservoir established in the same year 
when noc assumed developmental responsibility for the field in  production was minimal hampered by  we believe  among other factors  a lack of funding  civil strife and utilization of old technology and methods 

table of contents the ninotsminda field is the easternmost element of an elongate anticline which includes the samgori and patardzeuli fields 
the ninotsminda field is separated from patardzeuli by a saddle and a nw se trending cross fault 
the field structure comprises an elongate anticline which measures km e w by km and has a maximum structural relief of around  feet meters 
the main reservoir horizon is the middle eocene which consists of well bedded deep marine sedimentary rocks eroded from volcanoes 
such rocks typically have low matrix porosity with the gross fieldwide effective porosity of around and permeability in the range of md  however  in the ninotsminda field there are well developed sub vertical fractures which provide secondary porosity and permeability of up to md 
the reservoir which in the field area is up to  feet meters thick is at a depth of  feet  meters below surface to  feet  meters below surface 
production from the field is facilitated by a strong water drive 
the oil accumulation has a gas cap which together form a maximum hydrocarbon column of  feet meters thickness  with the gas oil contact at  feet  meters true vertical depth sub sea tvdss and the oil water contact at  feet  meters tvdss 
the oil itself is a high quality sweet crude api  with just sulphur  paraffin and tar and asphaltene 
field map noc began an immediate rehabilitation of the ninotsminda field in which included repairing and adding perforations to existing wells  obtaining additional seismic data and a limited drilling program 
the first new well named n was completed in october and a second well n was completed in october  and sidetracked as a horizontal producer in this well had produced  barrels of oil to the end of january 
table of contents as a result of this development work  subsequent drilling and the completion of a dynamic reservoir model  it was suggested that a higher level of production could be achieved from the middle eocene reservoir from horizontal wells drilled in a preferred orientation so as to intersect the main fracture sets 
in january  a new horizontal sidetrack well nh was successfully completed and originally put on production at over  barrels of oil per day bopd 
at the end of january  this well had produced  barrels of oil 
two further horizontal sidetrack wells nh and nh were successfully completed in september and in december respectively 
the nh well tested at rates of over  bopd and nh at rates in excess of  bopd 
although all three wells were put on production at lower rates in accordance with the recommendations of independent petroleum engineering specialists  it has not been possible to maintain long term production due to water incursion resulting from  what we believe to be  reservoir damage caused by conventional drilling techniques 
on june   we announced that we had signed a contract with weus holding inc  a subsidiary of weatherford international ltd weatherford  for the supply of under balanced coiled tubing drilling ubctd services to our projects in georgia 
under the terms of the contract  weatherford will supply and operate a ubctd unit to be used on a program of up to horizontal wellbores on our ninotsminda and samgori fields 
elsewhere in the oil industry  the use of under balanced drilling techniques has been shown to result in significantly less formation damage  resulting in higher sustained production rates and ultimate recovery 
at the same time  utilisation of coiled tubing drilling gives greater flexibility in the drilling process and in the control of the horizontal section 
although ubctd is now used commonly in north america  with significant success  these techniques have not yet been applied in the former soviet union 
however  we believe that these combined drilling technologies will provide the best way to develop and produce both the ninotsminda and samgori fields 
we plan to drill at least five under balanced horizontal sidetracks on the ninotsminda field 
these include nh and nh  which were previously planned to be drilled using conventional drilling techniques 
a second horizontal well nh east horizontal will be drilled from the n well bore which achieved good rates of production when drilled horizontally with conventional techniques and which was later the subject of a blow out in september a sidetrack is also being planned from the n well 
a new well n is included in the program  this well will be designed so as to have more than one horizontal wells drilled from it 
these will be drilled into the eastern part of the field  an area that is currently largely undeveloped 
the ubctd equipment will be utilized to drill only the horizontal section through the reservoir 
preparatory work on the existing vertical wells  including sidetracking and cutting of casing windows for the horizontal wellbores  and the drilling of any new wells will be undertaken by our own operating company using our own drilling rigs and equipment 
ubctd operations started on the first well in the program  the nh well  in december the well is located in the east part of the ninotsminda field where the reservoir is tighter but it is believed to be relatively un drained 
we prepared the well with our own crew which involved sidetracking from the existing well bore at  feet  meters down to  feet  meters and setting a inch liner 
however  technical problems with the equipment caused a number of delays which resulted in the under balance drilling not being completed until late february  these initial teething problems have now been resolved and it is anticipated that the under balanced drilling in future wells in the program will be completed within a much shorter period 
the production interval in the nh well is approximately  feet meters 
during drilling  sustained gas flow rates of between to mmcf of gas per day were measured using weatherford s equipment 
we believe that this is the biggest gas flow rate ever measured from a well in georgia to date 
at march  the well was still undergoing production testing 
the ubctd unit has now been mobilised to the nh well  in an area of the reservoir which has shown prolific production in the past 
following the experience while drilling nh certain modifications to the equipment are being made and as such  commencement of drilling on the nh well is not expected before late march significant additional work has also been undertaken at other well locations to prepare them for recompletion as horizontal producers 
these include the n well  which has a surface location very close to n and as such requires minimal mobilisation  and the n well on the ninotsminda field  which are currently shut in  
table of contents manavi the first exploration well drilled on the manavi structure  a large prospect at cretaceous level  within the ninotsminda psc area reached total depth in september this well was the second well drilled under a participation agreement with aes gardabani a subsidiary of aes corporation aes relating to the exploration and potential future development of sub middle eocene gas prospects in parts of the ninotsminda psc 
in january  the first well drilled under the participation agreement  n  reached a depth of  feet  meters without having reached the targeted cretaceous zone 
the well was terminated primarily for mechanical reasons  having penetrated a significant thickness of hydrocarbon bearing sandstones in the lower eocene and palaeocene sequences 
three formation tests were carried out on these sandstones which recovered o api sg oil  but without commercial flow  despite the installation of a down hole progressive cavity pump 
we have concluded that the reason for the lack of commercial flow was either that the zone was of low permeability  or that it suffered substantial formation damage due to the mud used to drill the well 
potential still remains in this sequence but the n well was recompleted in as a middle eocene horizontal oil producer on the ninotsminda field 
under the participation agreement  aes was to earn a interest in identified prospects at the sub middle eocene stratigraphic level rocks older than the middle eocene sequence ie  below the producing horizons of the ninotsminda field by funding two thirds of the cost of a three well exploration program 
however  prior to the completion of the program as defined in the participation agreement  aes withdrew from the participation agreement in february in order to focus on its core business 
the participation agreement was terminated without aes earning any rights to any of the ninotsminda manavi area reservoirs 
under a separate letter agreement  if gas from the sub middle eocene is discovered and produced from the ninotsminda manavi area  aes will be entitled to recover at the rate of of future gas sales from the sub middle eocene  net of operating costs  their funding under the participation agreement 
aes also has an option to enter into a five year take or pay gas sales agreement for a quantity up to million cubic meters per year at an initial contract price of per thousand cubic feet per thousand cubic meters 
the manavi well  m  was targeting a large cretaceous prospect in the manavi area  east of the ninotsminda field  with further potential in the middle eocene 
this well was suspended for financial reasons in  following the withdrawal of aes from the participation agreement  at a depth of  feet  meters  but re started following a farm in by a local oil service company in september this well was drilled to a total depth of  feet  meters  and encountered the cretaceous limestone target at  feet  meters 
drilling data and wire line logs indicated the presence of hydrocarbons in the cretaceous and a production liner was set for testing 
after initially very encouraging clean up flows of drilling fluid accompanied by good quality api oil  and gas  flow stopped due to a mechanical collapse of the production tubing 
we believe that this is the first discovery of oil in the cretaceous sequence in georgia  however  this sequence is a prolific producer in nearby chechnya and dagestan 
regional outcrop studies in east central georgia indicate that the cretaceous reservoir unit to be over  feet meters thick 
although over feet meters of hydrocarbons were encountered in the manavi well  no oil water contact was identified on the logs 
an earlier well  the manavi m well  drilled to the south of the m location  encountered hydrocarbons in the cretaceous limestone sequence over  feet  meters deeper  before this well was abandoned without testing being completed 
mapping of the manavi cretaceous oil discovery indicates a substantial potential oilfield might be present 
in addition  the shallower middle eocene sequence encountered in the well also had hydrocarbon indications  and awaits testing 
this is approximately  feet  meters deeper than the currently assumed oil water contact for eastern ninotsminda  and may indicate deeper oil in this area 
following the initial testing of the m well  canargo and noc agreed with its farm in partner gbosc  to buy out its interest in the well by issuing to gbosc two million shares of canargo common stock 
as such noc has now regained its interest in the well  subject only to the possible gas sales related arrangements with aes mentioned above 
attempts to recover the damaged tubing from the m well were unsuccessful 
the well was prepared subsequently for sidetracking and additional drilling equipment including more powerful mud pumps and bicentrical drilling bits were added to our rig for this work 
operations recommenced in december and the mz sidetrack is currently at a depth of  feet  meters 
drilling in this section is complicated by the presence of extremely over pressured swelling clays  and these continue to cause drilling problems for our equipment 
after extensive technical analysis and discussions with the international drilling contractor saipem spa saipem  and 
table of contents with a major drilling mud company it has been decided that the optimum way to sidetrack this well to the top of the reservoir as planned will be to use an oil based mud system to control the swelling clays on the sapiem ideco e az drilling rig which is equipped with a top drive drilling system and can use an oil based mud system unlike our current ural mash rig 
as described below  we have already concluded an agreement with saipem to provide a rig and drilling services to the company 
it is expected that the sidetrack will be completed in a more effective manner utilising this new equipment 
it is now planned to sidetrack the well with the saipem rig to the top of the reservoir sequence at  feet  meters where a inch casing will be set 
the saipem rig is currently being mobilised to georgia and should be ready to re commence drilling of the sidetrack by the middle of april 
the conventional drilling operations are expected to be completed by the middle of may  after which weatherford will take over using the ubctd unit to drill down into the cretaceous and fully evaluate the oil discovery 
although management is excited about the potential of the manavi prospect  a fair amount of additional drilling and analysis is still required before we will be able to fully evaluate the reserves and productive possibilities of this prospect 
on june   we announced that our operating subsidiary in georgia had signed a contract with great wall drilling company gwdc of china to supply drilling services for the drilling of a first appraisal well m on the manavi oil discovery with an option to drill further wells 
however  due to an unacceptable delay in mobilising the rig to georgia  on january   we signed an alternative contract with saipem 
under the terms of the contract  saipem will supply an ideco e az drilling rig complete with crew to drill the manavi appraisal well to an approximate depth of  feet  meters in the cretaceous 
the contract includes an option to drill further wells 
the rig and associated equipment is currently being mobilised from astrakhan in southern russia to georgia where it will now first complete the mz sidetrack 
in order to expedite the manavi appraisal program  we plan to drill and set surface casing on the m well while saipem first complete the mz sidetrack  thereby minimising any delay in the appraisal of this potentially important discovery 
the m location is approximately km to the west of the manavi m cretaceous oil discovery well  and located on seismic data acquired by canargo in apart from the middle eocene sequence on the ninotsminda field there are a number of other reservoirs which contain oil 
we have not yet fully evaluated the reserves and economics of production from these zones which include shallower oil reservoirs  the gas cap on the ninotsminda field itself or from the hydrocarbon bearing zones below the middle eocene 
to fully evaluate these zones  further seismic  technical interpretation and drilling will be required 
with respect to gas production  only limited short duration gas supply contracts currently exist for production directly from the gas cap 
gas currently produced from the middle eocene and upper zones is subject to market conditions and environmental constraints within georgia and the ability of noc to arrange short term gas supply agreements as required 
west rustavi and kumisi in addition to the ninotsminda field and manavi prospect  under the ninotsminda psc  noc has rights to one other field  west rustavi and an underlying gas prospect named kumisi 
the west rustavi field is located approximately miles km southeast of the ninotsminda field 
prior to noc gaining the ninotsminda psc  georgian oil drilled ten wells in the west rustavi field area  two of which produced oil 
the middle eocene zone is thinner and less productive in this area than what is found in the ninotsminda field and only limited production has taken place from the west rustavi field 
however noc has carried out only very limited workover activity on west rustavi  and potential may yet exist for further oil production from the middle eocene dependant on technical and economic factors 
horizontal drilling may also be appropriate for this deposit 
one of the ten wells drilled in the west rustavi field was tested in the deeper cretaceous paleocene horizon 
this well was tested and produced million cubic feet of gas and  barrels of water per day  and is interpreted to have tested the down dip extent of a cretaceous gas deposit named kumisi 
additional seismic data has been acquired by noc over this structure  but further geo technical work is required on this horizon to determine its potential size  which could be significant 
given a positive outcome from this work  
table of contents noc has potential plans to appraise this discovery dependent on this technical work and on commercial sales contracts for gas off take 
in addition to the horizons discussed above  seismic and well data are currently being interpreted to identify further prospects in the ninotsminda area at several different stratigraphic levels 
samgori the samgori field complex is the largest field discovered to date in georgia 
it was discovered in  when oil was produced from the middle eocene fractured volcanoclastic sequence in the samgori area 
further exploration resulted in the discovery in of the patardzeuli extension to the east  and subsequently in of the south dome accumulation 
production of the high quality low sulphur crude increased  focused initially on samgori  then on patardzeuli  with peak production reaching over  bopd in the primary reservoir in the samgori complex is the middle eocene as in the ninotsminda field  with additional potential in the upper eocene and lower eocene 
however  the reservoir is somewhat thicker than in ninotsminda on average approximately  feet thick meters and having better porosity and permeability 
samgori oil is sweet and light o api having very similar characteristics to ninotsminda crude but unlike ninotsminda there is no gas cap 
the state company georgian oil originally operated the field and in the latter years of the soviet regime production dropped off rapidly falling to almost nothing over the period to in october  national petroleum limited npl signed an agreement with georgian oil to further develop the samgori field complex  and to explore the surrounding licence block xi b 
under the original joint venture the commercial terms were extremely tough for npl  and this was subsequently re negotiated in the form of a production sharing contract 
this followed the georgian petroleum law which came into force in and in npl signed a new production sharing contract with a much more appropriate commercial structure 
despite this  no further significant work was carried out and field production stood at approximately bopd at the end of georgian oil samgori limited gosl  a wholly owned subsidiary of georgian oil  acquired npl s interest in the psc in december  but with npl having an option to reclaim their interest in the event that an agreed work programme was not carried out 
in addition npl have the right to recover their previous costs from a portion of gosl s net profits  and retain a small net profit interest 
it is this agreement that we farmed into in january within the samgori psc area there are several identified prospects and discoveries in other horizons  notably the upper eocene  lower eocene and cretaceous 
independent evaluations carried out previously indicate significant potential  not only in the samgori field itself  but also in other discoveries and prospects in the large block 
these include the krtsanisi middle eocene oil discovery  the rustavi gas condensate discovery and the west teleti and varketili lower eocene palaeocene gas discoveries 
as this acreage lies adjacent to other canargo licence areas  the potential of this block will be integrated into an overall exploration appraisal programme with our existing discoveries and prospects  involving further seismic acquisition and appraisal exploration drilling 
on august  we announced that we had commenced drilling operations on a new samgori field development well s  the first new well to be drilled on the field for several years 
the well which was targeting a previously undrilled area of the field was drilled to a total depth of  feet  meters in mid october having encountered moveable oil in the middle eocene reservoir 
the well will be completed with one or more horizontal sidetracks utilising the ubctd unit 
completion of this well at our cost fulfilled our farm in obligations under our agreement with gosl 
as with our existing producing ninotsminda field  it has been recommended that future horizontal wells should be drilled under balanced on the samgori field complex  utilising coiled tubing 
it is expected that such techniques will result in more efficient production  longer horizontal sections  and less chance of causing damage to the reservoir 
it is planned to drill up to horizontal sections from existing vertical wells or new well bores 
this will be undertaken as part of an integrated development program planned for both the ninotsminda and samgori fields under the weatherford ubctd contract described above 
in the meantime  work is going on to extend the ninotsminda dynamic reservoir model to include the samgori complex which will be used to identify the under balanced drilling locations

proved reserves are those reserves estimated as recoverable under current technology and existing economic conditions from that portion of a reservoir which can be reasonably evaluated as economically productive on the basis of analysis of drilling  geological  geophysical and engineering data  including the reserves to be obtained by enhanced recovery processes demonstrated to be economically and technically successful in the subject reservoir 
proved reserves include proved developed reserves producing and non producing reserves and proved undeveloped reserves 
proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive wells that are reasonably certain of production when drilled 
uncertainties exist in the interpretation and extrapolation of existing data for the purposes of projecting the ultimate production of oil from underground reservoirs and the corresponding future net cash flows associated with that production 
the estimating process requires educated decisions relating to the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the amount and timing of cost recovery is a function of oil and gas prices which can fluctuate significantly over time 
the oil price used in the report by opc as of january  was per barrel based on the net price per barrel received by noc in december the net gas price is per mcf 
having considered the geological and engineering data in the interpretation process  the company believes with reasonable certainty that the stated proven reserves represent the estimated quantities of oil and gas to be recoverable in future years under existing operating and economic conditions 
no independent reserves have been assessed for the west rustavi field 
neither have independent reserves been assessed for the samgori field complex as the original contractor party to the samgori psc  npl  has an option to reacquire its contractor s interest in the samgori psc and its interest in the operating company in the event that the agreed work program which includes the drilling of horizontal well sections is not completed in accordance with the agreement npl concluded with gosl in december we are committed to this work program through our farm in agreement with gosl dated january  on completion of the agreed work program  we would aim to book reserves for the field which are properly attributable to us 
in the meantime  we will continue to benefit from our share of production 

table of contents undeveloped acreage the following table summarizes the gross and net undeveloped acreage held under the ninotsminda  nazvrevi block xiii  norio north kumisi  tbilisi and samgori production sharing contracts as of december  the information regarding net acreage represents our interest based on our interest in noc and the subsidiaries holding the nazvrevi block xiii contract  the norio north kumisi and the tbilisi block xi g and xi h contracts  and our current interest in the samgori block xi b contract through our wholly owned subsidiary csl

noc and csl now use that infrastructure  including initial processing equipment 
the mixed oil  gas and water fluid produced from the ninotsminda field wells flows into a two phase separator located at the ninotsminda field  where gas associated with the oil is separated 
the oil and water mixture is then transported eleven kilometers either in a pipeline or by truck to georgian oil s central processing facility at sartichala for further treatment 
the gas is transported to sartichala in a separate pipeline where some is used for fuel and the rest is either piped kilometers to rustavi where it is delivered to the rustavi industrial complex for sale to a number of customers or delivered to the neighbouring communities 
oil produced from the samgori field complex is also transported to sartichala for treatment prior to sale 
at sartichala  the water is separated from the oil 
noc and csl then sell their share of oil in this state to buyers at sartichala for local consumption or transfers it by pipeline kilometers to a railhead at gatchiani or by road tanker to vaziani rail loading terminal primarily for export sales 
at the railheads  the oil is loaded into railcars for transport to the black sea port of batumi  georgia  where oil can be loaded onto tankers for international shipment 
buyers transport the oil at their own risk and cost from the delivery point at sartichala 
noc sells its oil directly to local and international buyers 
in  noc sold its oil production in accordance with the terms of sales agreements concluded with sveti limited and primrose financial group which included the sale of oil to customers nominated under these agreements

other georgian production sharing contracts nazvrevi and block xiii production sharing contract nazvrevi psc in february  we entered into a second production sharing contract with georgian oil and the state of georgia 
this contract covers the nazvrevi block xi d and block xiii areas of east georgia  an approximately  acre  km exploration area adjacent to the ninotsminda and west rustavi fields and containing existing infrastructure 
the agreement came into effect on february  and extends for twenty five years with the final year of the contract being we are required to relinquish at least half of the area then covered by the nazvrevi psc  but not any portions being actively developed  at five year intervals commencing in the first relinquishment was made in  of the southern part of the area  reducing the area to approximately  acres  km 
under the nazvrevi psc  we pay all operating and capital costs 
we first recover our cumulative operating costs from production 
after deducting production attributable to operating costs  of the remaining production profit petroleum  considered on an annual basis  is applied to reimburse us for our cumulative capital costs 
while cumulative capital costs remain unrecovered  the other of remaining production is allocated on a basis 
table of contents between georgian oil and canargo 
after all cumulative capital costs have been recovered by us  remaining production after deduction of operating costs is allocated on a basis between georgian oil and canargo  respectively 
thus  while we are responsible for all of the costs associated with the nazvrevi psc we are only entitled to receive of production after cost recovery 
the allocation of a share of production to georgian oil  however  relieves us of all obligations we would otherwise have to pay the republic of georgia for taxes and similar levies related to activities covered by the production sharing contract 
both georgian oil and canargo will take their respective shares of oil production under the nazvrevi psc in kind but the intent is to jointly market any available gas production 
the first phase of the preliminary work program under the nazvrevi psc involved primarily a seismic survey of a portion of the exploration area and the processing and interpretation of the data collected 
the seismic survey has been completed  and the results of those studies continue to be interpreted  with a view towards defining possible oil and gas prospects and exploration drilling locations 
the cost of the seismic program was approximately million  and met the minimum obligatory work commitment under the contract 
the department for protection of mineral resources and mining has confirmed that we have met the requirements of the work program defined in the production sharing agreements 
the manavi oil discovery may extend into the nazvrevi psc area and the kumisi gas discovery may extend into block xiii  and there are several identified prospects  however as the nazvrevi and block xiii area is an exploration area and no discoveries have been made to date  it is not possible to estimate the expenditures needed to discover and if discovered  produce commercial quantities of oil and gas 
norio block xi c and north kumisi production sharing agreement norio psa in december  canargo  through its then owned subsidiary canargo norio limited cnl  entered into a third production sharing contract with the state of georgia represented by georgian oil and the state agency for regulation of oil and gas resources in georgia 
the norio psa covers the norio and north kumisi blocks of east georgia  an exploration area of approximately  acres  km adjacent to the ninotsminda and samgori fields 
the norio psa came into effect on april  and extends for a period of twenty five years with the final year of the contract being there are two existing oil fields on the norio psa area  norio and satskhenisi which are old  small  relatively shallow fields and which produce small quantities of oil 
cnl has determined production from these fields to be uneconomic  and the fields are currently being operated by georgian oil under a service agreement with cnl  whereby georgian oil takes all production to compensate it for its costs under what is effectively a social program 
if cnl wishes  it could take over field operations and production from these fields forthwith 
the commercial terms of the norio psa are similar to those of the nazvrevi psc with the exception that after all cumulative capital costs have been recovered by cnl  remaining production after deduction of operating costs is allocated on a basis between georgian oil and cnl  respectively 
thus  while cnl is responsible for all of the costs associated with development of the norio psa  it is only entitled to receive of production after cost recovery 
on september  we announced that we had increased our interest in cnl  by buying out the remaining minority shareholders who held a interest in that company 
cnl is now a wholly owned subsidiary of canargo 
the first phase of the preliminary work program under the norio psa involved primarily a seismic survey of a portion of the exploration area and the processing and interpretation of the data collected 
the seismic survey has been completed  and the results of those studies have and will continue to be interpreted 
in addition to the main target  which is the middle eocene  the potential of the license area to produce from the miocene  sarmatian  upper eocene and cretaceous is being assessed 
the cost of the seismic program was approximately million 
the second phase of the preliminary work program under the norio psa commenced in january with the first exploration well named mk drilled on a large prospect identified at middle eocene level which is analogous to the nearby samgori field immediately to the south of the block 
it has been reported that the samgori oil field has produced approximately million barrels of oil to date 
the mk well was initially drilled to a depth of  feet  meters  at which depth the well was suspended in august due to lack of available funding at that time 
downhole seismic data acquired in the well bore 
table of contents indicated the target may be at a depth of approximately  feet  meters  and cnl did not have sufficient funding to complete the well to that depth 
however the state agency for the regulation of oil and gas resources in georgia confirmed that cnl had satisfied all drilling and work obligations under the terms of the norio psa by the initial phase of drilling of the mk well 
in connection with this initial phase of drilling  which cost a total of million  our partner in cnl sought to farm out to us and to third party investors part of its interest in cnl to partly fund the drilling of the mk well 
one of these third party investors was provincial securities limited  an investment company to which mr 
russell hammond  a non executive director of canargo  is an investment advisor 
cnl s total share of these drilling costs was million 
in november  shareholders of cnl agreed to adjust the ownership of cnl to reflect the funding for the mk well  and capitalization of certain loans and management fees that we had made to cnl 
under this agreement  our interest increased from to in cnl 
cnl then sought a partner to assist with the financing to deepen the mk well 
in september  cnl signed a farm in agreement relating to the norio psa with a wholly owned subsidiary of georgian oil  the georgian state oil company 
cnl had previously been in negotiations with a large third party energy company to farm in to the norio psa  but georgian oil exercised its pre emption rights under the norio psa 
georgian oil is already a party to the norio psa as the commercial representative of the state 
the farm in agreement obligates georgian oil to pay up to million to deepen  to a planned depth of  feet  meters the mk well in return for a interest in the contractor share of the norio psa 
georgian oil also has an option the option  exercisable for a limited period after completion of the well  to increase its interest to of the contractor share of the norio psa on payment to cnl of us million 
if georgian oil exercises this option under the farm in agreement  it loses its rights to exercise the psa option under the norio psa itself 
co incident with the georgian oil farm in  we concluded a deal to purchase some of the minority interests in cnl by a share swap for shares in canargo 
through this exchange we acquired an additional interest in cnl  thus increasing our interest to 
the purchase was achieved by issuing million restricted canargo common shares to the minority interest holders in cnl 
of the interests in cnl  provincial securities limited owned 
on september  we acquired the remaining minority shareholders who held a interest in cnl 
we issued a further million restricted common shares in connection with this transaction 
cnl is now a wholly owned subsidiary of canargo 
in the event that georgian oil exercises the option and pays the required million  we will receive this payment in full 
if georgian oil exercises this option we will issue a further million restricted shares to the minority interest holders 
drilling at the mk well  funded by georgian oil  recommenced in december and the well was drilled ahead to a depth of  feet  meters 
the well is now cased  having encountered oil bearing sands in the oligocene formation which is a secondary objective for the well 
electric logs run over the oligocene sequence indicate over feet meters of net pay sands with porosities in the range of to 
from the oil shows while drilling and log analysis  these sands appear to be oil bearing 
it is planned to test the oligocene sands once the well has reached total depth 
data obtained from a vertical seismic profile run in the well indicates that there is a seismic reflector some feet meters below the current depth of the well which may be the primary target 
the well is currently suspended and it is planned to recommence drilling activities as soon as one of our drilling crews  who are presently engaged in our under balanced coiled tubing drilling operation on the ninotsminda field  and in the drilling of the manavi mz sidetrack becomes available 
the norio psa covers a large exploration area with what management believe to be good oil and gas potential 
we have mapped several significant prospects at different stratigraphic levels within the area several of which are on trend with the mk well and the structure which is being tested 
as the area in which we are currently drilling is an exploration area with no commercial discoveries excluding the small shallow fields currently operated by georgian oil  it is not possible to estimate the expenditures needed to discover and  if discovered  produce commercial quantities of oil and gas 

table of contents block xi g and xi h production sharing contract tbilisi psc in november  our subsidiary  canargo norio limited cnl  won the tender for the oil and gas exploration and production rights to the tbilisi psc  an area of approximately  acres km in eastern georgia adjacent to the norio  block xiii and west rustavi areas 
in july  it was announced that cnl  had signed a production sharing contract covering these areas 
the tbilisi psc came into effect on september  and will continue for an initial period of ten years at which time it will terminate unless we have made a commercial discovery in which case the psc will continue in full force and effect until september  we view these blocks as having good potential  being adjacent to productive acreage and with some existing wells on the blocks 
the commercial terms of the tbilisi psc are similar to those of the norio psa with the exception that georgian oil does not have an option to acquire an interest in the contractor party s share following a commercial discovery 
cnl will evaluate existing seismic and geological data during the first year and acquire additional seismic data within three years of the effective date of the psc which was set as september the total commitment over the next four years is  the above mentioned georgian oil farm in to the norio psa does not apply to the tbilisi psc

table of contents potential caspian exploration project in may  canargo led a consortium which submitted a bid in a tender for two large exploration blocks in the caspian sea  located off the shore of the autonomous russian republic of dagestan 
the consortium was the successful bidder in the tender and was awarded the right to negotiate licenses for the blocks 
following negotiations  licenses were issued in february to a majority owned subsidiary of canargo 
during we concluded that we did not have the resources to advance this project 
accordingly  in november  we reduced our interest to 
subsequent to this  a restructuring of interests in the project took place with us increasing our interest slightly to  and with rosneft  the russian state owned oil company  becoming the majority owner of the project with 
seismic was acquired as part of this restructuring and future plans include interpretation of this data and possible drilling 
however  due to our small interest in this project and our inability to secure an effective joint operating agreement  we have had little or no control over the operator 
as management does not contemplate any further investment in this project  we have fully impaired our  investment in the caspian exploration project as of september  potential kazakhstan project in december  we announced details of the acquisition of oil and gas interests in kazakhstan which were previously owned by the uk public company atlantic caspian resources plc acr through a specially established associated company  tethys petroleum investments limited tpi which we have a non controlling ownership acquired a interest in bn munai llp bnm  a kazakh limited liability partnership on certain conditions being satisfied 
in september  together with atlantic caspian resources plc acr  we formed a limited partnership  tethys petroleum investments limited tpi and its wholly owned subsidiary tethys kazakhstan ltd tki 
as part of this investment  acr contributed its ownership interest in too bn munai llp bnm into tki in exchange for ownership of tpi and we committed to funding the day to day operations and provide management services until third party financing could be arranged in exchange for ownership of tpi 
bnm s interest centers on the akkulkovsky exploration area and the kyzyloy gas field  located in western kazakhstan  just to the west of the aral sea 
in the four years prior to our ownership interest  acr drilled two deep exploration wells in the akkulkovsky area  which they plugged and abandoned after demonstrating the presence of hydrocarbons  due to funding limitations on their part 
on the same day that we consummated the transaction to create tpi  we entered into an agreement to sell half of our ownership interest in tpi to provincial securities limited  an investment company to which mr 
russell hammond  one of our non executive directors  is an investment advisor  in consideration for future services of providing advice to us concerning funding the development of tpi as we intend to fund the majority of the development of the kyzyloy gas field through third party financing 
the following day we entered into a technical services agreement and a loan agreement with tpi in which we agreed to provide our managerial expertise and to provide cash advances to fund and manage the day to day operations of tpi and to provide funding to secure additional site licences within the vicinity of the kyzyloy gas field 
the advances under the agreement  both cash and the value of services we perform on behalf of tpi  bear interest at the rate of per annum and are repayable immediately upon the receipt by tpi of third party financing 
on june   we announced that that deal has now been finalised with the registration of canargo s interest in bn munai llp bnm 
we have acquired this interest through tpi in which we are currently a shareholder 
tpi s wholly owned subsidiary tethys kazakhstan ltd tkl has now become officially registered as the owner of a interest in bnm

table of contents completed at the beginning of and we expect the generator will be delivered to the buyer in the near future following receipt of the final payment 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
of our full time employees  the entity acting as operator of the ninotsminda field for ninotsminda oil company has full time employees  and substantially all of that company s activities relate to the production and development of the ninotsminda field 
we have not experienced any strikes  work stoppages or other labour disputes and management believes the company s relations with its employees are satisfactory 
risks associated with canargo s activities reference is hereby made to the section entitled qualifying statement with respect to forward looking information with respect to certain qualifications regarding the following information canargo s ability to generate cash flows our ability to continue to pursue our principal activities of acquiring interests in and developing oil and gas fields is dependent upon reducing costs  generating funds from internal sources including the sale of certain non core assets  external sources and  ultimately  maintaining sufficient positive cash flows from operating activities 
our financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that operating cash flows  additional funding and or proceeds from the sale of non core assets received meet our cash flow needs 
if these operating cash flows  additional financings  are not in accordance with our expectations  adjustments may have to be made to our business plan which will limit our development and exploration activities 
development of the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have interests involves multi year efforts and substantial cash expenditures 
full development of these properties will require the availability of substantial funds from internal and or external sources 
we believe that we will be able to generate funds from quasi governmental financing agencies  conventional lenders  equity investors and other oil and gas companies that may desire to participate in our oil and gas projects 
in february  we announced that we had signed a standby equity distribution agreement that allows us  at our option  to issue shares to us based investment fund cornell capital partners lp up to a maximum value of  over a period of up to two years from the date on which the registration statement on form s registering for resale the shares under the securities act of  as amended securities act is declared effective 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on february  also  on september  we announced that we had completed a global public offering global offering of million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
we raised  in gross proceeds and  in net proceeds after the payment of commissions but before the payment of the expenses of the global offering aggregating  current operations dependent on success of the ninotsminda and samgori fields and georgian exploration until recently  we have directed substantially all of our efforts and most of our available funds to the development of the ninotsminda field in the republic of georgia  exploration in that area and some ancillary activities closely related to the ninotsminda field project 
this decision is based on management s assessment of the potential of the ninotsminda field area and the surrounding areas including the samgori field area in which we acquired an interest in however  the company s focus on the ninotsminda field has over the past several years resulted in overall losses for us and we have yet to be profitable 
there can be no assurances that the exploration and development plans for the ninotsminda field and the samgori field will be successful 
for example  these fields may not produce sufficient quantities of oil and gas to justify the investments made and the planned future investments for the fields  and we may not be able to produce the oil and gas at a sufficiently low cost or to market the oil and gas produced at a sufficiently high price to generate a positive cash flow and a profit 
our georgian exploration and appraisal program is an important factor for future success and this program may not be successful  as it carries substantial technical risk 

table of contents write off of unsuccessful properties and projects in order to realize the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures  we must produce oil and gas in sufficient quantities and then sell such oil and gas at sufficient prices to produce a profit 
we have a number of unevaluated oil and gas properties 
the risks associated with successfully developing unevaluated oil and gas properties are even greater than those associated with successfully continuing development of producing oil and gas properties  since the existence and extent of commercial quantities of oil and gas in unevaluated properties have not been established 
possible inability to finance present oil and gas projects our ability to finance all of our present oil and gas projects and other ventures according to present plans is dependent upon obtaining additional funding 
an inability to obtain financing could require us to scale back or abandon part or all of our project development  capital expenditures  production and other plans 
apart from the evaluation of the economics of specific investment proposals  the availability of equity or debt financing to us  or to the entities that are developing projects in which we have interests  is affected by many factors  including world and regional economic conditions  the state of international relations  the stability and legal  regulatory  fiscal and tax policies of various governments in areas in which we have or intend to have operations  fluctuations in the world and regional price of oil and gas and in interest rates  the outlook for the oil and gas industry in general and in areas in which we have or intend to have operations  and competition for funds from possible alternative investment projects 
potential investors and lenders will also be influenced by their evaluations of us and our projects  including their technical difficulty  and the comparison with available alternative investment opportunities 
additional funds needed for long term oil and gas development plans it will take many years and substantial cash expenditures to develop fully our oil and gas properties 
the company generally has the principal responsibility to provide financing for its oil and gas properties and ventures 
accordingly  we need to raise additional funds from outside sources in order to pay for project development costs beyond those currently budgeted through we may not be able to obtain that additional financing  or such funds may only be available on commercially unattractive terms 
if  in either such case  adequate funds are not available  it will be necessary to scale back or even suspend operations 
the carrying value of the ninotsminda field may not be realized unless additional capital expenditures are incurred to develop the field 
furthermore  additional funds will be required to pursue exploration activities on our existing undeveloped properties 
while expected to be substantial  without further exploration work and evaluation the amount of funds needed to fully develop all of our oil and gas properties cannot at present  be quantified 
oil and activities involve risks  many of which are beyond our control our exploration  appraisal  development and production activities are subject to a number of factors and risks  many of which may be beyond our control 
first  we must successfully identify commercial quantities of oil and gas 
the exploration and development of an oil and gas deposit can be affected by a number of factors which are beyond the operator s control  such as unexpected or unusual geological conditions  the recoverability of the oil and gas on an economic basis  the availability of infrastructure  equipment and personnel to support operations  
table of contents local and global oil prices  and government regulation and legal uncertainties 
the company s activities can also be affected by a number of hazards  such as labour disputes  natural phenomena  such as bad weather and earthquakes  operating hazards  such as fires  explosions  blow outs  pipe failures and casing collapses  and environmental hazards  such as oil spills  gas leaks  ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
any of these hazards could result in damage  losses or liability for the company 
there is also an increased risk of some of these hazards in connection with operations that involve the rehabilitation of fields where less than optimal practices and technology were employed in the past  as was often the case in the former soviet union 
we do not purchase insurance covering all of the risks and hazards that are involved in oil and gas exploration  development and production 
risk of political instability with respect to foreign operations our principal oil and gas properties and activities are in the republic of georgia  which is located in the former soviet union 
operation and development of these assets is subject to a number of conditions endemic to former soviet union countries  including political instability 
the present governmental arrangements in the former soviet union in which we operates were established relatively recently  when they replaced communist regimes 
if they fail to maintain the support of their citizens  other institutions  including a possible reversion to totalitarian forms of government  could themselves replace these governments 
our operations typically involve joint ventures or other participatory arrangements with the national government or state owned companies 
the ninotsminda psc covering the ninotsminda field is an example of such an arrangement 
as a result of such dependency on government participants  our operations could be adversely affected by political instability  changes in government institutions  personnel  policies or legislation  or shifts in political power 
there is also the risk that governments could seek to nationalize  expropriate or otherwise take over our oil and gas properties 
we are not insured against such political risks because management deems the premium costs of such insurance to be currently prohibitively expensive 
risk of social  economic and legal instability the political institutions in the countries which comprise the former soviet union have recently become more fragmented  and the economic institutions of many of these countries have only recently converted to a market economy from a planned economy 
new laws have been introduced  and the legal and regulatory regimes in such regions are often vague  containing gaps and inconsistencies  and are constantly subject to amendment 
application and enforceability of these laws may also vary widely from region to region within these countries 
due to this instability  former soviet union countries are subject to certain additional risks including the following uncertainty as to the enforceability of contracts  sudden or unexpected changes in demand for crude oil and or natural gas  the lack of trained personnel  and the lack of equipment and services and the presence of other factors that could significantly change the economics of production 
social  economic and legal instability have accompanied these changes due to many factors which include low standards of living  high unemployment  undeveloped and constantly changing legal and social institutions  and conflicts within and with neighbouring countries 

table of contents this instability can make continued operations in affected regions difficult or impossible 
inadequate or deteriorating infrastructure in the former soviet union countries in the former soviet union often either have underdeveloped infrastructures or  as a result of shortages of resources  have permitted infrastructure improvements to deteriorate 
the lack of necessary infrastructure improvements can adversely affect operations 
for example  the lack of a reliable electrical power supply caused noc to suspend drilling of one well and the testing of a second well during the winter season  although the availability of electrical power supplies has been more regular since that time 
currency risks in the former soviet union payment for oil and gas products sold in the former soviet union countries may be in local currencies 
although we currently sell our oil principally for us dollars  we may not be able to continue to demand payment in hard currencies in the future 
although most former soviet union country currencies are presently convertible into us dollars  there is no assurance that convertibility will continue 
even if currencies are convertible  the rate at which they convert into us dollars is subject to fluctuation 
in addition  the ability to transfer currencies into or out of the former soviet union countries may be restricted or limited in the future 
we may enter into contracts with suppliers in former soviet union countries to purchase goods and services in us dollars 
the company may also obtain from lenders credit facilities or other debt denominated in us dollars 
if we cannot receive payment for oil and oil products in us dollars and the value of the local currency relative to the us dollar deteriorates  we could face significant negative changes in working capital 
tax risks in the former soviet union countries in the former soviet union frequently add to or amend existing taxation policies in reaction to economic conditions including state budgetary and revenue shortfalls 
since we are dependent on international operations  specifically those in georgia  we may be subject to changing taxation policies including the possible imposition of confiscatory excess profits  production  remittance  export and other taxes 
while we are not aware of any recent or proposed tax changes which could materially adversely affect our operations  such changes could occur although we have negotiated economic stabilization clauses in our production sharing agreements in georgia and all current taxes are payable from the state s share of petroleum produced under the production sharing contracts 
conflicting interests with our partners joint venture  acquisition  financing and other agreements and arrangements must be negotiated with independent third parties and  in some cases  must be approved by governmental agencies 
these third parties generally have objectives and interests that may not coincide with those of the company and may conflict with our interests 
unless we are able to compromise these conflicting objectives and interests in a mutually acceptable manner  agreements and arrangements with these third parties will not be consummated 
we may not have a majority of the equity in the entity that is the licensed developer of some projects  that we may pursue in the former soviet union  even though we may be the designated operator of the oil or gas field 
in such circumstances  the concurrence of co ventures may be required for various actions 
other parties influencing the timing of events may have priorities that differ from ours  even if they generally share the same objectives 
demands by or expectations of governments  co venturers  customers  and others may affect our strategy regarding the various projects 
failure to meet such demand or expectations could adversely affect our participation in such projects or its ability to obtain or maintain necessary licenses and other approvals 
demands by or expectations of governments  co venturers  customers and others may also affect our strategy regarding various projects 
failure to meet such demands or expectations could adversely affect our participation in such projects or our ability to obtain or maintain necessary licenses and other approvals 

table of contents governmental registration operating entities in various foreign jurisdictions must be registered by governmental agencies  and production licenses for development of oil and gas fields in various foreign jurisdictions must be granted by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies generally have broad discretion in determining whether to take or approve various actions and matters 
in addition  the policies and practices of governmental agencies may be affected or altered by political  economic and other events occurring either within their own countries or in a broader international context 
changes in the market price of oil and gas prices for oil and natural gas and their refined products are subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors which are beyond our control  including global changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions in the middle east and elsewhere  and overall global and regional economic conditions 
a reduction in oil prices can affect the economic viability of our operations 
there can be no assurance that oil prices will be at a level that will enable us to operate at a profit 
oil and gas production could vary significantly from reserve estimates oil and natural gas reserves and their values as determined by petroleum engineers are estimates only 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
these estimates are based on professional judgments about a number of elements the amount of recoverable crude oil and natural gas present in a reservoir  the costs that will be incurred to produce  transport and market the crude oil and natural gas  and the rate at which production will occur 
reserve estimates are also based on evaluations of geological  engineering  production and economic data 
the data can change over time due to  among other things additional development activity  evolving production history  and changes in production costs  market prices and economic conditions 
as a result  the actual amount  cost and rate of production of oil and gas reserves and the revenues derived from sale of the oil and gas produced in the future will vary from those anticipated in the most recent report on our oil and gas reserves prepared by opc as of january  the magnitude of those variations may be material 
the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  conduct successful exploration and development activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional productive zones in existing wells or secondary recovery reserves  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
future crude oil and natural gas production is therefore highly dependent upon our level of success in replacing depleted reserves 

table of contents oil and gas operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation governments at all levels  national  regional and local  regulate oil and gas activities extensively 
we must comply with laws and regulations which govern many aspects of our oil and gas business  including exploration  development  production  refining  marketing  transportation  occupational health and safety  labour standards  and environmental matters 
we expect the trend towards more burdensome regulation of our business to result in increased costs and operational delays 
this trend is particularly applicable in developing economies  such as those in the former soviet union where we have our principal operations 
in these countries  the evolution towards a more developed economy is often accompanied by a move towards the more burdensome regulations that typically exist in more developed economies 
competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include integrated and independent oil and gas companies 
many of our competitors are large  well established  well financed companies 
because of our small size and our lack of financial resources  we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies 
operations are dependent on chairman of the board and chief executive dr 
david robson  the chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer of canargo  is our executive who has the most experience in the oil and gas industry and who has the most extensive business relationships in the former soviet union 
our business and operations could be significantly harmed if dr 
robson were to leave the company or become unavailable because of illness or death 
dr 
robson through his company  vazon energy limited  has signed a comprehensive management services agreement with a rolling six month notice period and a two year non competition clause effective from the date of termination of the agreement 
we do not carry key employee insurance on any of our employees
