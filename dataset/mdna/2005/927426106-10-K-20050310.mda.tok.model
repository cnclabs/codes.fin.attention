directors  officers and principal shareholders of the company have had and will continue to have banking transactions with the bank in the ordinary course of business 
any loans and commitments to lend included in such transactions are made in accordance with applicable law  on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons of similar creditworthiness  and on terms not involving more than the normal risks of collection or presenting other unfavorable features 
the company is prohibited by the bhca  except in certain statutorily prescribed instances  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting share of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary 
however  the company  subject to the prior approval of the frb  may engage in any  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities that are deemed by the frb to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
under frb s regulations  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner 
in addition  it is the frb s policy that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks  a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the frb to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the frb s regulations or both 
the company s securities are registered with the sec under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
as such  the company is subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading and other requirements and restrictions of the exchange act see item business  supervision and regulation  sarbanes oxley act of the bank the bank  as a california chartered bank  is subject to primary supervision  periodic examination  and regulation by the dfi and the fdic 
to a lesser extent  the bank is also subject to certain regulations promulgated by the frb 
if  as a result of an examination of the bank  the fdic should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of the bank s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation  various remedies are available to the fdic 
such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict the growth of the bank  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors and ultimately to terminate the bank s deposit insurance  which for a california chartered bank would result in a revocation of the bank s charter 
the dfi has many of the same remedial powers 
various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the state of california and the united states affect the operations of the bank 
state and federal statues and regulations relate to many aspects of the bank s operations  including reserves against deposits  ownership of deposit accounts  interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  mergers and acquisitions  borrowings  dividends  locations of banking centers and capital requirements 
furthermore  the bank is required to maintain certain levels of capital see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources 
following a regular joint examination by the fdic and the dfi in november  the bank s board of directors approved and signed a voluntary agreement the agreement with the fdic and dfi on july  in relation to the bank s significant growth over the last several years  the bank continues to assess and develop its policies and procedures to facilitate the successful implementation of its strategic plan and capital adequacy plan while maintaining the safety and soundness of the bank 
the adoption of the agreement formalizes many of the actions that the bank has already taken to strengthen its operational procedures  broaden its directorship and augment its senior management team 
the bank continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements 
operating performance and asset quality continues to be strong  and deposit generation and liquidity continues to be satisfactory to support its operations 
prior to entering into the agreement  the bank s existing three year strategic plan and capital adequacy plan called for a measured growth 
in accordance with the agreement  the bank will notify the fdic and dfi of any deviations beyond its strategic plan  including any growth beyond of its total assets per annum  which level is within the existing strategic plan s framework 
consistent with the terms of the agreement  the bank added one new director to its board of directors by december   and subsequently added another director in january the bank believes it is in fulfillment of the agreement  and the agreement will not materially adversely affect the successful implementation of the company s strategic business plan  the company s financial condition or results of operations  or the company s previously announced earnings guidance 
dividends and other transfer of funds dividends from the bank constitute the principal source of income to the company 
the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
the company s ability to pay cash dividends is limited by california law 
under california law  shareholders of the company may receive dividends when and as declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose 
with certain exceptions  a california corporation may not pay a dividend to its shareholders unless i its retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed dividend  or ii after giving effect to the dividend  the corporation s assets would equal at least times its liabilities and  for corporations with classified balance sheets  the current assets of the corporation would be at least equal to its current liabilities or  if the average of the earnings of the corporation before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the interest expense of the corporation for those fiscal years  at least equal to times its current liabilities 
the fdic and the dfi have authority to prohibit the bank from engaging in activities that  in their opinion  constitute unsafe or unsound practices in conducting its business 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question and other factors  that the fdic and the dfi could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under some circumstances  be an unsafe or unsound practice 
furthermore  the fdic and the frb have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by banks or bank holding companies under their jurisdiction 
compliance with the standards set forth in such guidelines and the restrictions that are or may be imposed under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law could limit the amount of dividends which the bank or the company may pay 
an insured depository institution is prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or  with certain limited exceptions  making capital distributions if after such transaction the institution would be undercapitalized 
the dfi may impose similar limitations on the bank see item 
business  supervision and regulation  prompt corrective action 
the bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit to  or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of  the company or other affiliates  the purchase of  or investments in  stock or other securities thereof  the taking of such securities as collateral for loans  and the purchase of assets of the company or other affiliates 
such restrictions prevent the company and other affiliates from borrowing from the bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts 
furthermore  such secured loans and investments by the bank to or in the company or to or in any other affiliates are limited  individually  to of the bank s capital and surplus as defined by federal regulations  and such secured loans and investments are limited  in the aggregate  to of the bank s capital and surplus as defined by federal regulations 
california law also imposes certain restriction with respect to transactions involving the company and other controlling persons of the bank 
additional restrictions on transaction with affiliates may be imposed on the bank under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law see item 
business  supervision and regulation  prompt corrective action 
capital requirements the frb and the fdic have established risk based minimum capital guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by united states banking organizations 
these guidelines are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as commercial loans 
the federal banking agencies require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risked based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to average assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio must be 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above minimum guidelines and ratios 
prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories 
fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations  management and capital distributions  depending on the category in which an institution is classified 
failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements 
an undercapitalized institution must develop a capital restoration plan 
at december   the bank exceeded all of the required ratios for classification as well capitalized 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized  may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
banking agencies have also adopted regulations which mandate that regulators take into consideration i concentrations of credit risk  ii interest rate risk when the interest rate sensitivity of an institution s assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off balance sheet position  and iii risks from non traditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage those risks  when determining the adequacy of an institution s capital 
this evaluation will be made as a part of the institution s regular safety and soundness examination 
in addition  the banking agencies have amended their regulatory capital guidelines to incorporate a measure for market risk 
in accordance with the amended guidelines  the company and any company with significant trading activities must incorporate a measure for market risk in its regulatory capital calculations 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the supervising agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses for violations of law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions vary commensurate with the severity of the violation 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv asset growth  v earnings  and vi compensation  fees and benefits 
in addition  the federal banking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and earnings standards 
these guidelines provide six standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating 
under these standards  any insured depository institution should i conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets  ii estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses  iii compare problem asset totals to capital  iv take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets  v consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations  and vi provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk 
these guidelines also set forth standards for evaluating and monitoring earnings and for ensuring that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
premiums for deposit insurance the company s deposit accounts are insured by the bank insurance fund bif  as administered by the fdic  up to the maximum permitted by law 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operation  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order  or condition imposed by the fdic or the institution s primary regulator 
the fdic charges an annual assessment for the insurance of deposits  which as of december   ranged from to basis points per of insured deposits  based on the risk a particular institution poses to its deposit insurance fund 
the risk classification is based on an institution s capital group and supervisory subgroup assignment 
an institution s risk category is based upon whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or less than adequately capitalized 
each insured depository institution is also assigned to one of the following supervisory subgroups subgroup a  b or c 
subgroup a institutions are financially sound institutions with few minor weaknesses  subgroup b institutions are institutions that demonstrate weaknesses which  if not corrected  could result in significant deterioration  and subgroup c institutions are institutions for which there is a substantial probability that the fdic will suffer a loss in connection with the institution unless effective action is taken to correct the areas of weakness 
insured institutions are not allowed to disclose their risk assessment classification and no assurance can be given as to what the future level of premiums will be 
the community reinvestment act cra the bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving lending  investing and other cra activities 
cra requires the company to identify the communities served by the company s offices and to identify the types of credit and investments the company is prepared to extend within such communities including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
it also requires the company s regulators to assess the company s performance in meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such assessment into consideration in reviewing application for mergers  acquisitions  relocation of existing branches  opening of new branches and other transactions 
a bank may be subject to substantial penalties and corrective measures for a violation of certain fair lending laws 
the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and cra in consideration when regulating and supervising other banking activities 
a bank s compliance with its cra obligations is determined based on a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on an institution s lending  service and investment performance 
an unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denying a merger application 
the bank s latest cra examination was completed by the fdic 
the bank received an overall rating of satisfactory in complying with its cra obligations 
financial services modernization legislation in november  the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act was enacted 
the glb act repeals provisions of the glass steagall act which restricted the affiliation of federal reserve member banks with firms engaged principally in specified securities activities  and which restricted officer  director or employee interlocks between a member bank and any company or person primarily engaged in specified securities activities 
in addition  the glb act contains provisions that expressly preempt any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations  primarily related to insurance 
the general effect of the law is to establish a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the bhca framework to permit a holding company to engage in a full range of financial activities through a new entity known as a financial holding company 
financial activities is broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance and securities activities  but also merchant banking and additional activities that the frb  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines to be financial in nature  incidental to such financial activities or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
the glb act provides that no company may acquire control of an insured savings association unless that company engages  and continues to engage  only in the financial activities permissible for a financial holding company  unless the company is grandfathered as a unitary savings and loan holding company 
the glb act grandfathers any company that was a unitary savings and loan holding company on may  or became a unitary savings and loan holding company pursuant to an application pending on that date 
the glb act also permits national banks to engage in expanded activities through the formation of financial subsidiaries 
a national bank may have a subsidiary engaged in any activity authorized for national banks directly or any financial activity  except for insurance underwriting  insurance investments  real estate investment or development  or merchant banking  which may only be conducted through a subsidiary of a financial holding company 
financial activities include all activities permitted under new sections of the bhca or permitted by regulation 
to the extent that the glb act permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the glb act is intended to grant to community banks powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis and which unitary savings and loan holding companies already possess 
nevertheless  the glb act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the company faces from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than the company has 
regulation w transactions between a bank and its affiliates are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
the federal deposit insurance act applies sections a and b to insured nonmember banks in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were members of the federal reserve system 
the frb has also recently issued regulation w  which codifies prior regulations under sections a and b of the federal reserve act and provides interpretative guidance with respect to affiliate transactions 
affiliates of a bank include  among other entities  the bank s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank 
the company is considered to be an affiliate of the bank 
in general  subject to certain specified exemptions  a bank or its subsidiaries are limited in their abilities to engage in covered transactions with affiliates to an amount equal to of the bank s capital and surplus  in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate  and to an amount equal to of the bank s capital and surplus  in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates 
in addition  a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in certain transactions only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies
