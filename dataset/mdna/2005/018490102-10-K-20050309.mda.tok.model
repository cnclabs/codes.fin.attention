item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our financial condition at december  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under the caption certain factors and trends affecting allergan and its businesses in item of part i of this report 
in addition  the following review should be read 
table of contents in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our products at an amount between one to two months of our net sales 
we generally offer cash discounts to customers for the early payment of receivables 
those discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the same period that the related sale is recorded 
the amounts reserved for cash discounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for cash discounts deducted from consolidated sales in  and  were million  million and million  respectively 
we permit returns of product from any product line by any class of customer if such product is returned in a timely manner  in good condition and from the normal channels of distribution 
return policies in certain international markets provide for more stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
allowances for returns are provided for based upon an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
the amount of allowances for sales returns reserved at december  and were million and million  respectively 
provisions for sales returns deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
historical allowances for cash discounts and product returns have been within the amounts reserved or accrued  respectively 
additionally  we participate in various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs  the largest of which relates to medicaid 
sales rebates and other incentive programs also include chargebacks  which are contractual discounts given primarily to federal government agencies and group purchasing organizations 
sales rebates and incentive accruals reduce revenue in the same period that the related sale is recorded and are included in other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the million increase in the amount accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs is primarily due to a difference in the timing of when payments were made against accrued amounts at december  compared to december  and an increase in the ratio of us pharmaceutical product sales  principally eye care pharmaceutical products  subject to such rebates and incentive programs 
provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our procedures for estimating amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs at the end of any period are based on available quantitative data and are supplemented by management s judgment with respect to many factors including  but not limited to  current market place dynamics  changes in contract terms  changes in sales trends  an evaluation of current laws and regulations and product pricing 
quantitatively  we use historical sales  product utilization and rebate data and apply forecasting techniques in order to estimate our liability amounts 
qualitatively  management s judgment is applied to these items to modify  if appropriate  the estimated liability amounts 
there are inherent risks in this process 
for example  customers may not achieve assumed utilization levels  customers may misreport their utilization to us  and actual movements of the us consumer price index urban cpi u  which affect our rebate programs with us federal and state government agencies  may differ from those estimated 
on a quarterly basis  adjustments to our estimated liabilities for sales rebates and other incentive programs related to sales made in prior periods have not been material and have generally been less than of consolidated net sales 
an adjustment to our estimated liabilities of of consolidated net sales on a quarterly basis would result in an increase or 
table of contents decrease to net sales and earnings before income taxes of approximately million to million 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program and type of customer 
additionally  there is a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated liability and when we actually pay the liability 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated liabilities over several periods  which can result in a net increase to earnings or a net decrease to earnings in those periods 
material differences may result in the amount of revenue we recognize from product sales if the actual amount of rebates and incentives differ materially from the amounts estimated by management 
we recognize as other income  license fees based upon the facts and circumstances of each licensing agreement 
in general  we recognize income upon the signing of a license agreement that grants rights to products or technology to a third party if we have no further obligation to provide products or services to the third party after granting the license 
we defer income under license agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not culminated 
pensions we sponsor various pension plans in the us and abroad in accordance with local laws and regulations 
our pension plans in the us account for a large majority of our pension plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations 
in connection with these plans  we use certain actuarial assumptions to determine the plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations  the most significant of which are the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate 
our assumption for the expected long term rate of return on assets in our us pension plan to determine the net periodic benefit cost is for  which is the same rate used for and percentage points lower than our expected rate of return of 
we determine  based upon recommendations from our pension plans investment advisors  the expected rate of return using a building block approach that considers diversification and rebalancing for a long term portfolio of invested assets 
our investment advisors study historical market returns and preserve long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income in a manner consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
they also evaluate market factors such as inflation and interest rates before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
the expected rate of return is applied to the market related value of plan assets 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the return on assets assumption would increase our expected us pre tax pension benefit cost by approximately million 
the discount rate used to calculate our us pension benefit obligations at december  is  which represents a percentage point decline from our december  rate of 
we determine the discount rate largely based upon an index of high quality fixed income investments us moody s aa corporate long bond yield average at the plans measurement date 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the discount rate assumption would increase our expected us pre tax pension benefit costs by approximately million and increase our us pension plans projected benefit obligations at december  by approximately million 
income taxes income taxes are determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of lower tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions and research and development  or r d  tax credits available in the united states 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the fiscal year as new information is obtained  which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  reserves for tax contingencies  utilization of r d tax credits and changes in or interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities  along with net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value 
table of contents to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the amount of valuation allowances at december  compared to december  is primarily due to a change in the estimated amount of r d tax credit carryforwards that we believe will be realized during the current year 
this change in estimate occurred due to improved clarity regarding the calculation of these credits provided by the completion of recent statutory audits and our improved domestic profitability  which we expect will allow a greater amount of r d tax credit carryforwards to be realized than previously estimated 
material differences in the estimated amount of valuation allowances may result in an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes if the actual amounts for valuation allowances required against deferred tax assets differ from the amounts estimated by us 
we have not provided for withholding and us taxes for the unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have currently reinvested these earnings permanently in such operations 
at december   we had approximately  million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
tax expense would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings 
upon remittance  certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available  subject to certain limitations  for use as credits against our us tax liability  if any 
on october   the american jobs creation act of  or the act  was enacted in the united states 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the act on our operations and our effective tax rate 
in particular  we are evaluating the act s provisions relating to incentives to reinvest foreign earnings in the united states  which require a domestic reinvestment plan to be created and approved by our board of directors before executing any repatriation activities 
at this time  we have not completed our evaluation 
we expect to complete our evaluation by the end of our third fiscal quarter the range of reasonably possible amounts of unremitted foreign earnings that may be considered for repatriation is currently between zero and million 
the related range of income tax effects of such repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we are also evaluating allowable deductions  beginning in  for income attributable to united states production activities 
at this time  we are unable to determine the effect of this new deduction on our future provision for income taxes  but we do not believe that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
purchase price allocation the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
during  we acquired oculex pharmaceuticals  inc  or oculex  and bardeen sciences company  llc  or bardeen  for aggregate purchase prices of approximately million and million  respectively 
the prices were allocated to identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the respective transaction dates 
the oculex transaction was determined to be a business combination  while the bardeen transaction was considered to be an asset acquisition and not a business combination 
accordingly  we have provided pro forma financial information in our financial statements to reflect the effect of the oculex transaction on our historical operating results  but have not done so for the bardeen transaction 
see note  acquisitions  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report 
we determined that the assets acquired from oculex and bardeen consisted principally of incomplete in process research and development and that these projects had no alternative future uses in their current state 
we reached this conclusion based on discussions with our business development and research and develop 
table of contents ment personnel  our review of long range product plans and our review of a valuation report prepared by an independent valuation specialist 
the valuation specialist s report reached a conclusion with regard to the fair value of the in process research and development assets in a manner consistent with principles prescribed in the aicpa practice aid  assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries 
in connection with the acquisition of oculex  we determined that the assets acquired also included a proprietary technology drug delivery platform which was separately valued and capitalized as core technology 
we reached this conclusion based on our determination that the acquired technology had alternative future uses in its current state 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
discontinued operations in june  we completed the spin off of our optical medical device business to our stockholders 
the optical medical device business consisted of two businesses our ophthalmic surgical products business and our contact lens care product business 
the spin off was effected by contributing our optical medical device business to a newly formed subsidiary  amo  and issuing a dividend of amo s common stock to our stockholders 
our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained herein have been recast to reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of amo as a discontinued operation 
we did not account for our ophthalmic surgical and contact lens care businesses as a separate legal entity 
therefore  the following selected financial data for our discontinued operations is presented for informational purposes only and does not necessarily reflect what the net sales or earnings would have been had the businesses operated as a stand alone entity 
the financial information for our discontinued operations includes allocations of certain of our expenses to those operations 
these amounts have been allocated to our discontinued operations on the basis that is considered by management to reflect most fairly or reasonably the utilization of the services provided to  or the benefit obtained by  those operations 
see note  discontinued operations  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report 
effective with the third quarter of our fiscal year  we no longer include the results of operations and cash flows of our discontinued optical medical device business in our consolidated financial statements 
the following table sets forth selected financial data of our discontinued operations 
selected financial data for discontinued operations year ended december  in millions net sales earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax through the end of  actual costs incurred by us related to the amo spin off  including restructuring and duplicate operating expenses  were approximately million  including million of costs incurred prior to this amount excludes million in costs incurred in that were allocated to discontinued operations 
during and  we reversed approximately million and million  respectively  of our restructuring charge related to the amo spin off due to adjustments to certain estimated amounts and also paid million for various taxes  net of amounts associated with a tax sharing agreement with amo  related to intercompany purchases of assets by amo prior to the spin off that were deferred and charged to retained earnings as part of the dividend of amo stock to our stockholders 
additionally  we believe we have incurred approximately million to million of additional annual net costs associated with dissynergies  contract manufacturing arrangements and changes to cost and debt capital structure as a result of the separation of amo from us 
we began to incur these additional costs during 
table of contents the second half of  and they are not reflected in our results of continuing operations for the first half of our manufacturing and supply agreement with amo is scheduled to terminate in june we currently estimate that we will incur between million and million of additional restructuring costs associated with the termination of that agreement and related exit activities 
we began to incur these costs in the fourth quarter of  and we recorded a restructuring charge of million in we expect to complete the additional restructuring activities associated with the amo spin off by the end of the fourth quarter of see note  restructuring charges and asset write offs and duplicate operating expenses  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for a discussion of the termination of the manufacturing and supply agreement with amo 
continuing operations headquartered in irvine  california  we are a technology driven  global health care company that develops and commercializes specialty pharmaceutical products for the ophthalmic  neurological  dermatological and other specialty markets 
we employ approximately  persons around the world 
we are an innovative leader in therapeutic and over the counter products that are sold in more than countries 
our principal markets are the united states  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
results of continuing operations we operate our business on the basis of a single reportable segment specialty pharmaceuticals 
we currently produce a broad range of ophthalmic products for glaucoma therapy  ocular inflammation  infection  allergy and dry eye  skin care products for acne  psoriasis and other prescription and over the counter dermatological products  and botox for certain therapeutic and cosmetic indications 
we provide global marketing strategy teams to ensure development and execution of a consistent marketing strategy for our products in all geographic regions that share similar distribution channels and customers 
the following discussion reflects our results of continuing operations  unless otherwise indicated 
management evaluates its various product portfolios on a revenue basis  which is presented below 
we also report sales performance using the non gaap financial measure of constant currency sales 
constant currency sales represent current period reported sales  adjusted for the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding period in the prior year 
we calculate the currency effect by comparing adjusted current period reported amounts  calculated using the monthly average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year  to the actual current period reported amounts 
we routinely evaluate our net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of our sales 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower  respectively  than growth reported at actual exchange rates

the million increase in net sales from 
table of contents the impact of foreign currency changes in compared to was due primarily to the strengthening of the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar and japanese yen  partially offset by weakness in the brazilian real and other latin american currencies compared to the us dollar 
the million increase in net sales in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in sales of our eye care pharmaceuticals and botox product lines and an increase in other non pharmaceutical sales  partially offset by a decline in sales of our skin care products 
eye care pharmaceuticals sales increased in compared to primarily because of strong growth in sales of our glaucoma drug  lumigan  especially in the us and europe  growth in sales of restasis  our drug for the treatment of chronic dry eye disease  growth in sales of eye drop products  primarily refresh  an increase in sales of zymar  a newer anti infective  new product sales generated from elestat tm  our topical antihistamine used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis that was launched in the united states in the first quarter of by our co promotion partner  inspire pharmaceuticals  inc  and an increase in sales of acular ls  our newer generation non steroidal anti inflammatory 
this increase in sales was partially offset by a decrease in sales of ocuflox  our older generation anti infective that is experiencing generic competition in the united states  and acular  our older generation anti inflammatory 
our alphagan franchise sales also decreased in compared to due to a general decline in us wholesaler demand for alphagan p  market share erosion from generic alphagan competition and an increase in the ratio of alphagan p sales subject to medicaid rebates in the united states 
we continue to believe that generic formulations of alphagan will have a negative impact on future net sales of our alphagan franchise 
the first generic formulation of alphagan was approved by the fda in the second quarter of and the second generic formulation of alphagan was approved by the fda in the third quarter of we estimate the majority of the change in our eye care pharmaceutical sales was due to mix and volume changes  however  we increased the published list prices for certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states  ranging from zero to nine percent  effective january  we increased the published us list price for lumigan by five percent  and we left the price of restasis unchanged as of the same effective date 
on may   we increased the published us list price for restasis by five percent 
this increase in prices had a subsequent positive net effect on our us sales  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our products at an amount between one to two months of our net sales 
at december   based on available external and internal information  we believe the amount of average us wholesaler inventories of our products was below our stated policy levels 
we expect the wholesaler inventory levels of our products to return to our normal policy levels during the first six months of  which may create above average us wholesaler demand for our products in the first six months of compared to demand experienced in the first six months of botox sales increased in compared to primarily as a result of strong growth in demand in the united states and international markets for both therapeutic and cosmetic uses 
based on internal information  we estimate that in botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales and cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales 
therapeutic and cosmetic net sales grew approximately and  respectively  in compared to effective december   we increased the published list price for botox and botox cosmetic in the united states by approximately seven percent  which we believe had a corresponding positive effect on our us sales growth in international botox sales also benefited from strong sales growth in europe  especially in france  spain and italy  as a result of the march launch in france of vistabel and the second quarter launches of vistabel in spain and certain scandinavian countries and vistabex tm in italy  as well as an increase in sales of botox in smaller distributor markets serviced by our european export sales group 
vistabel and vistabex tm are the trade names for botox cosmetic in europe and italy  respectively 
we believe our worldwide market share for neuromodulators  including botox  is over 
skin care sales declined in compared to primarily due to a decrease in sales of tazorac in the united states  where it is fda approved to treat both psoriasis and acne  and lower sales of avage  which we launched in the us in the first quarter of tazorac sales declined primarily due to excess in channel 
table of contents inventory at the end of  which we believe was principally at the retail pharmacy level 
this type of excess in channel inventory is difficult to detect from all sources of available market data 
we increased the published us list price for tazorac and avage by nine percent effective january  and by an additional five percent effective july  the million increase in net sales in compared to was the result of increases in sales in all three product lines  and an increase in other non pharmaceutical product sales  which consist primarily of contract manufacturing sales to amo 
eye care pharmaceutical net sales increased in compared to net sales in primarily because of strong growth in sales of our glaucoma drug lumigan  our alphagan ophthalmic solutions product line for glaucoma  which includes both alphagan p and alphagan  new product sales of million generated from the second quarter initial launch of restasis  growth in sales of eye drop products  primarily refresh  and a net increase in sales of other eye care pharmaceutical products 
we estimate the majority of the change in our eye care pharmaceutical sales was due to mix and volume changes  however  we increased the published prices for certain of our eye care pharmaceutical products in the us effective april  this increase in prices had a subsequent positive net effect on our us sales  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our products at an amount between one to two months of our net sales 
during  us sales of ocuflox  an older anti infective  began to decline in the third quarter as sales of zymar  a newer anti infective  grew substantially 
in future periods  we expect sales of ocuflox to continue to decline as sales of zymar continue to increase and as generic competition increases for ocuflox in the united states 
botox sales increased in compared to as a result of strong growth in both the united states and international markets 
in  therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total botox net sales  and cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total botox net sales 
both therapeutic and cosmetic net sales grew approximately in constant currency in compared to international botox sales growth in compared to benefited from the march launch in france of vistabel  the european trade name for botox cosmetic 
effective december   we increased the published list price for botox and botox cosmetic in the us by approximately six percent  which had a corresponding positive effect on our us sales growth in we believe our worldwide market share as of december  was over for neuromodulators  including botox 
skin care net sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong sales of tazorac in the united states  where it is fda approved to treat both psoriasis and acne  and the launch in the first quarter of of avage 
the percentage of us sales in as a percentage of total product net sales declined percentage points to compared to us sales of in  due primarily to an increase in international eye care pharmaceuticals  principally in europe and asia pacific  as a percentage of total product net sales  and a decrease in us sales of skin care products  partially offset by an increase in us sales of botox as a percentage of total product net sales 
the percentage of us sales in as a percentage of total product net sales declined percentage points to compared to us sales of in  due primarily to a decrease in us eye care pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of total product net sales in compared to resulting from strong sales growth rates in europe  partially offset by an increase in the percentage of us other contract manufacturing sales due to the growth in sales to amo

net sales of botox  which generally have a higher gross margin percentage than our other pharmaceutical product lines  represented a greater percentage of net sales compared to the gross margin percentage for eye care pharmaceuticals declined in compared to due to an increase in the percentage of net sales derived from international sales  which generally have a lower gross margin percentage than us sales  a higher ratio of us sales subject to sales rebates and other incentive programs  especially medicaid  and products with higher royalty rates payable to third parties 
the gross margin percentage for our botox product line experienced a small decline in compared to due primarily to lower gross margins in latin america resulting from less favorable foreign exchange transactions that affected cost of sales in compared to the gross margin percentage for contract manufacturing sales improved primarily due to an increase in us dollar denominated pricing allowed under the manufacturing and supply agreement with amo at the beginning of our fiscal year and certain annual contract manufacturing cost recoveries allowed under the manufacturing and supply agreement with amo 
our gross margin percentage decreased in compared to primarily as a result of the higher amount of low margin contract manufacturing sales to amo  which had a negative impact on our total product mix  and a decrease in gross margin percentage for eye care pharmaceuticals  partially offset by a small increase in gross margin percentage for the botox product line and skin care products 
the gross margin percentage for eye care pharmaceuticals declined in compared to due to an increase in the mix of international sales and products with higher royalty rates payable to third parties

research services margin we have historically recognized research service revenues and costs associated with various contract research and development arrangements 
research service revenues and costs declined in compared to and as a result of our acquisition of bardeen in prior to the bardeen acquisition  we performed research and development services on compounds owned by bardeen pursuant to a research and development services agreement between us and bardeen 
since may   we have not been a party to any contract research and development arrangements similar to those previously reported

these increases were partially offset by a favorable million settlement during the first quarter of relating to a patent dispute covering the use of botulinum toxin type b for cervical dystonia and higher miscellaneous co promotion and royalty income 
sg a expenses in were also negatively impacted by an increase in the translated us dollar value of foreign currency denominated expenses  especially in europe  compared to the same periods in included in sg a expenses in were approximately million of duplicate operating expenses associated with the amo spin off 
no duplicate operating expenses were incurred in and duplicate operating expenses included advisory fees  product and regulatory transition costs  and salary and recruiting costs associated with the amo spin off 
excluding duplicate operating expenses in  sg a expenses increased million in compared to  but declined as a percentage of net sales in to compared to in the increase in sg a expenses in dollars in compared to  excluding duplicate operating expenses  was a result of higher promotion  selling and marketing expenses supporting the corresponding increase in sales  especially for lumigan  alphagan p and botox in the united states and lumigan  botox and refresh in europe  and higher selling and marketing expenses supporting the product launches of vistabel  restasis  zymar and avage 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses declined in compared to  due primarily to lower promotion  product samples and marketing expenses  as a percentage of net sales  despite the aggregate increase in expense dollars 
general and administrative expenses and selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were approximately the same in compared to excluding duplicate operating expenses in  the decline in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in promotion  selling  marketing and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
this decrease resulted primarily from the relatively high amount of expenses incurred in for promotion  selling and marketing activities related to the promotion of alphagan p in the united states and to the product launch of lumigan in europe and other international markets 
the decrease also resulted from cost reduction efforts in affecting european administrative functions

research and development spending in compared to increased most significantly in eye care pharmaceuticals due to increased spending for technologies not currently commercialized by us  including technologies acquired in from the acquisitions of oculex and bardeen 
research and development spending  excluding the effect of the in process research and development charges in  increased in compared to primarily as a result of higher rates of investment across all pharmaceutical product lines  especially in eye care pharmaceuticals due to increased spending for technologies not currently commercialized by us which were acquired in the bardeen acquisition  and to a lesser degree  the oculex acquisition 
settlement  restructuring charges and asset write offs  duplicate operating expenses in october  our board of directors approved certain restructuring activities related to the scheduled termination of our manufacturing and supply agreement with amo 
under the manufacturing and supply agreement  which was entered into in connection with the amo spin off  we agreed to manufacture certain contact lens care products and vitrax for amo for a period of up to three years ending in june as part of the termination of the manufacturing and supply agreement  we plan to eliminate certain manufacturing positions at our westport  ireland  waco  texas  and guarulhos  brazil manufacturing facilities 
we anticipate that the pre tax restructuring charges to be incurred in connection with the termination of the manufacturing and supply agreement  which are expected to total between million and million  will be recorded beginning in the fourth quarter of and continue up through and including the fourth quarter of the pre tax charges are net of expected tax credits available under qualifying government sponsored employment programs 
approximately million of the restructuring charges are expected to be cash charges 
the additional restructuring charges are expected to include approximately million to million associated with the reduction in our workforce of approximately individuals 
the workforce reduction will impact personnel in europe  the united states and latin america 
the workforce reduction began in the fourth quarter of and is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter the restructuring costs are also expected to include approximately million to million of other costs associated with the termination of the manufacturing and supply agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million related to the termination of the manufacturing and supply agreement 
these charges primarily include accruals for net statutory severance costs and the ratable recognition of termination benefits to be earned by employees who are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits

this restructuring charge consisted primarily of employee severance  facility closure and consolidation costs  asset write offs and other costs  all substantially related to the amo spin off 
the assets written off consisted primarily of manufacturing machinery and equipment  a building and various building improvements that were impaired or demolished in connection with the amo spin off 
the full year restructuring charge also included asset write offs of million unrelated to the amo spin off 
included in other costs within the net charge during is million of inventory write offs that have been recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
during and  we adjusted our restructuring charge estimates  resulting in certain reclassifications between restructuring activities and a net restructuring charge reversal of million in and million in the amo restructuring and spin off activities included a workforce reduction of positions  consisting of manufacturing  research and development  and selling  general and administrative positions over a one year period 
as of december   severance payments totaling million have been made to terminated employees since january a total of and manufacturing positions during the year ended december  and  respectively  included in the original position reduction did not require severance payments as certain employees terminated their employment prior to the date they would have qualified for severance or transferred to unfilled positions in other areas

duplicate operating expenses included advisory fees  salary and recruiting costs  product and regulatory transition costs  equipment and personnel relocation costs and other business transition expenses 
duplicate operating expenses have been included in the normal operating expense classifications to which they relate on the consolidated statements of operations 
operating income our operating income was million  or of product net sales in  compared to an operating loss of million  or of product net sales in  and operating income of million  or of product net sales in the million increase in operating income in compared to was due primarily to the million increase in gross margin and the million decrease in research and development expenses  partially offset by the increase in sg a expenses of million and an increase in restructuring charges of million 
the decrease in operating income of million in compared to was primarily due to the increase in research and development expenses of million  which includes million of pre tax charges for in process research and development associated with the acquisitions in of bardeen and oculex 
the decrease in operating income also resulted from the increase in sg a expenses of million  partially offset by the million increase in gross margin  the absence of the lumigan legal settlement charge of million in and a decrease in the restructuring charge and asset write offs of million

interest income also increased in compared to due to statutory interest income accrued in related to a refund claim for previously paid state income taxes 
the decline in interest income in compared to was due to a decline in average interest rates earned on all cash equivalent balances earning interest  of approximately  partially offset by higher average cash equivalent balances of approximately million in compared to interest 
table of contents expense increased million to million in compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our outstanding zero coupon convertible senior notes due  or senior notes  partially offset by lower other statutory interest expense 
during the third quarter of  we accelerated our amortization of debt issuance costs to a more conservative view  electing to amortize such costs related to our senior notes over the five year period from date of issuance in november to the first noteholder put date in november instead of over the year life of the senior notes 
as a result  we recorded an adjustment for the cumulative difference in amortized debt issuance costs as of the beginning of the third quarter of of million 
the impact of this adjustment is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  interest expense declined million to million in compared to million in  primarily due to lower interest expense related to the net effect of the november issuance of our senior notes at an annual effective rate of combined with the december redemption of a substantial portion of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due  which accrued interest at annually  partially offset by an increase in other statutory interest expense 
loss on investments in were million  representing the other than temporary impairment of certain third party investments and related collaborations 
at december   we had a carrying amount of million with a cost basis of million in third party equity investments with public and privately held companies 
these investments are subject to review for other than temporary declines in fair value on a quarterly basis

income taxes our effective tax rate in was compared to the effective tax rate of in included in our operating income in are pre tax restructuring charges of million primarily associated with the scheduled termination of our manufacturing and supply agreement with amo 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to these pre tax restructuring charges 
included in our provision for income taxes in is an estimated million income tax benefit for previously paid state income taxes  which became recoverable due to a favorable state court decision that became final during the second quarter of excluding the impact of the million pre tax restructuring charges and related tax benefit of million  and the million income tax benefit from the state court decision  our adjusted effective tax rate for was 
included in our operating loss in are pre tax charges of million and million for in process research and development associated with our acquisitions of bardeen and oculex  respectively 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to the bardeen charge because the acquisition was considered to be an asset acquisition for tax purposes whereas no income tax benefit was recorded for the oculex charge because the acquisition was considered to be an acquisition of stock for tax purposes 
excluding the impact of the total million of in process research and development charges and related tax benefit of million  our adjusted effective tax rate for was 
the increase in the adjusted effective tax rate to in compared to the adjusted effective tax rate in of was primarily attributable to the fact that our rate reflected the benefit of reserves 
table of contents for tax audit settlements  which were released in  partially offset by a positive tax rate effect from changes in the mix of our earnings during compared to our effective tax rate in was compared to the effective tax rate of in included in our operating loss in are pre tax charges of million and million for in process research and development associated with our acquisitions of bardeen and oculex  respectively 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to the bardeen charge because the acquisition was considered to be an asset acquisition for tax purposes whereas no income tax benefit was recorded for the oculex charge because the acquisition was considered to be an acquisition of stock for tax purposes 
excluding the impact of the total million of in process research and development charges and related tax benefit of million  our adjusted effective tax rate for was 
the increase in the adjusted effective tax rate to in compared to the effective tax rate of in was primarily attributable to the change in mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate and an increase in the us tax effect on foreign earnings and foreign dividends  partially offset by decreases in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million and estimated reserves for tax audit settlements of million and an increase in the benefit from research and development tax credits 
net earnings earnings from continuing operations were million in compared to a loss from continuing operations of million in the increase of million in earnings from continuing operations was primarily the result of the million increase in operating income and a million increase in total net non operating income  partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes of million 
our loss from continuing operations in was million compared to earnings from continuing operations of million in the million decrease in earnings from continuing operations was primarily the result of the million decrease in operating income  partially offset by a decrease in total net non operating expenses of million and a decrease in the provision for income taxes of million 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund our operations 
significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations  levels of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and capital expenditures  the extent of our stock repurchase program  funds required for acquisitions  adequate credit facilities  and financial flexibility to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements 
the net cash provided by continuing operations was million in compared to million in and million in operating cash flow from continuing operations increased in compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in earnings from continuing operations  including the effect of adjusting for non cash items  an increase in other accrued expenses  other liabilities and income taxes payable  partially offset by an increase in cash required to fund trade receivables  principally in north america  and growth in inventories  primarily finished goods for eye care pharmaceuticals and botox  and higher income taxes paid 
we paid pension contributions of million in compared to million in in  we expect to pay pension contributions of between approximately million and million 
at december   we disclosed consolidated unrecognized net actuarial losses of million which were included in our reported net prepaid benefit cost 
the unrecognized net actuarial losses resulted primarily from lower than expected investment returns on plan assets in and and decreases in the discount rates used to measure projected benefit obligations that occurred over the past four years 
assuming constant actuarial assumptions estimated as of our pension plans measurement date of september   we expect the amortization of these unrecognized net actuarial losses to increase our total pension costs by approximately million in compared to the amortization of approximately million of unrecognized net actuarial losses included in pension costs expensed in the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses included in pension costs in and was million and million  respectively 
the 
table of contents future amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial losses is not expected to materially affect future pension contribution requirements 
operating cash flow from continuing operations increased in compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in earnings from continuing operations  including the effect of adjusting for non cash items  which were positively affected by the absence in of the lumigan legal settlement charge and duplicate operating expenses related to the amo spin off  both of which were incurred in  a decrease in cash required to fund trade receivables and inventory growth  an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities  a decrease in income taxes paid  and a decrease in pension contributions which primarily affected the prepaid benefit cost for pensions included in other non current assets  partially offset by an increase in other non current assets  including intangibles 
we paid pension contributions of million in compared to million in the higher amount of pension contributions in compared to was due to our desire to maintain the fair value of certain pension plans assets at an amount greater than their respective accumulated benefit obligations 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in excluding net cash paid of million for the acquisitions of bardeen and oculex in  cash used in investing activities would have been million in we invested million in new facilities and equipment during compared to million in and million in during  the additions to property  plant and equipment included costs to construct an expansion of botox manufacturing facilities in ireland and a new biologics facility in irvine  california  which we expect to complete in during and  the additions to property  plant and equipment included costs to construct a new research and development facility in irvine  california  which we completed in capital expenditures in also included initial construction costs for expansion of botox manufacturing facilities in ireland 
net cash used in investing activities includes million  million and million to acquire software in  and  respectively 
we expect to invest approximately million to million in expenditures for manufacturing and laboratory facilities and other property  plant and equipment in net cash used in financing activities was million in  composed primarily of million for purchases of treasury stock  million for payment of dividends and million for net repayments of debt  partially offset by million of cash provided by the sale of stock to employees 
on january   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on march  to stockholders of record on february  net cash used in financing activities was million in  composed primarily of million for purchases of treasury stock  million for payment of dividends and million for repayments of convertible borrowings and long term debt 
cash was provided by the sale of stock to employees of million and an increase in notes payable and commercial paper borrowings of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  composed primarily of repayments of convertible borrowings of million  million for payments of dividends  million for purchases of treasury stock  million in net repayments of notes payable and long term debt and million for the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of convertible borrowings 
cash was provided by proceeds from the issuance of zero coupon convertible senior notes of million and million from the sale of stock to employees 
we maintain an evergreen stock repurchase program 
our evergreen stock repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase our common stock for the primary purpose of funding our stock based benefit plans 
under the stock repurchase program  we may maintain up to million repurchased shares in our treasury account at any one time 
as of december   we held approximately million treasury shares under this program 
we are uncertain as to the level of stock repurchases  if any  to be made in the future 
net cash provided by discontinued operations was million in the amount includes one time cash receipts from amo resulting from the sale of certain assets to amo in connection with its formation and restructuring and a capital distribution received by us just prior to the spin off of amo 
at december   we had a committed domestic long term credit facility  a committed foreign line of credit in japan  a commercial paper program  a medium term note program  an unused debt shelf 
table of contents registration statement that we may use for a new medium term note program and other issuances of debt securities  and various foreign bank facilities 
the committed domestic credit facility allows for borrowings of up to million through may the committed foreign line of credit allows for borrowings of up to three billion japanese yen approximately million through the commercial paper program also provides for up to million in borrowings 
we do not currently intend to have combined borrowings under our committed credit facilities and our commercial paper program that would exceed million in the aggregate 
the current medium term note program allows us to issue up to an additional million in registered notes on a non revolving basis 
the debt shelf registration statement provides for up to million in additional debt securities 
borrowings under the domestic credit facility and medium term note program are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include  among other provisions  maintaining minimum debt to capitalization ratios and minimum consolidated net worth 
certain covenants also limit subsidiary debt and restrict dividend payments 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  and had approximately million available for dividends at december  as of december   we had no borrowings under our domestic committed credit facility or commercial paper program  million in borrowings outstanding under our committed foreign line of credit  million in borrowings under various foreign bank loans and million in borrowings outstanding under the medium term note program 
on november   we issued zero coupon convertible senior notes due  or senior notes  in a private placement with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million 
the senior notes  which were issued at a discount of million  are unsecured  accrue interest at annually and mature on november  the senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock for each  principal amount at maturity if the closing price of our common stock exceeds certain levels  the credit ratings assigned to the senior notes are reduced below specified levels  or we call the senior notes for redemption  make specified distributions to our stockholders or become a party to certain consolidation  merger or binding share exchange agreements 
on july   we  together with wells fargo bank  as trustee  executed a supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the senior notes 
the supplemental indenture amends the indenture s redemption and conversion provisions to restrict our ability to issue common stock in lieu of cash to holders of the senior notes upon any redemption or conversion 
upon any redemption  we are now required to pay the entire redemption amount in cash 
in addition  upon any conversion  we will pay cash up to the accreted value of the senior notes converted and will have the option to pay any amounts due in excess of the accreted value in either cash or common stock 
the rights of the holders of the senior notes were not affected or limited by the supplemental indenture 
as of december   the conversion criteria had not been met 
see note  convertible notes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for a description of the conversion features 
as a sensitivity measure  the incremental dilutive effect to be used in the computation of diluted earnings per share from the assumed conversion of the senior notes would have been an increase of approximately million shares of common stock to the total number of diluted shares used to compute diluted earnings per share for the year ended december   if the closing price of our common stock during the specified conversion periods averaged per share the minimum price allowed for conversion during the periods and any amounts above the accreted value were settled in common stock 
holders of the senior notes may require us to purchase the senior notes on any of the following dates at the following prices per senior note on november   per senior note on november   and per senior note on november  pursuant to the supplemental indenture  we are required to pay cash for any senior notes purchased by us on any of these three dates 
we may not redeem the senior notes before november   and prior to november  we may redeem all or a portion of senior notes for cash in an amount equal to their accreted value only if the price of our common stock reaches certain thresholds for a specified period of time 
on or after november   we may redeem all or a portion of the senior notes for cash in an amount equal to their accreted value 
a substantial portion of our existing cash and equivalents are held by non us subsidiaries 
we currently plan to use these funds in our operations outside the united states 
withholdings of us taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have reinvested these earnings 
table of contents permanently in such operations 
as of december   we had approximately  million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
tax costs would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
on october   the american jobs creation act of  or the act  was enacted in the united states 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the act on our operations and our effective tax rate 
in particular  we are evaluating the act s provisions relating to incentives to reinvest foreign earnings in the united states  which require a domestic reinvestment plan to be created and approved by our board of directors before executing any repatriation activities 
at this time  we have not completed our evaluation 
we expect to complete our evaluation by the end of our third fiscal quarter the range of reasonably possible amounts of unremitted foreign earnings that may be considered for repatriation is currently between zero and million 
the related range of income tax effects of such repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we are also evaluating allowable deductions  beginning in  for income attributable to united states production activities 
at this time  we are unable to determine the effect of this new deduction on our future provision for income taxes  but we do not believe that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
our manufacturing and supply agreement with amo is scheduled to terminate in june we currently estimate that we will incur between million and million of total restructuring costs associated with the termination of that agreement and related exit activities 
we expect approximately million of the restructuring charges to be cash charges 
we recorded million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of and expect to complete the additional restructuring activities by the end of the fourth quarter of in january  our board of directors approved the initiation and implementation of a restructuring of certain activities related to our european operations 
the restructuring seeks to optimize operations  improve resource allocation and create a scalable  lower cost and more efficient operating model for our european research and development  or r d  and commercial activities 
specifically  the restructuring anticipates moving key european r d and select commercial functions from our mougins  france and other european locations to our irvine  california  high wycombe  uk and dublin  ireland facilities and streamlining our european commercial back office functions 
under applicable law  the proposed restructuring requires consultations and  in certain cases  negotiations with european and national works councils  other management labor organizations and local authorities 
the restructuring steps to be implemented and their ultimate cost will depend in part on the outcome of such consultations and negotiations 
we anticipate incurring restructuring charges and charges relating to severance  relocation and one time termination benefits  payments to public employment and training programs  implementation  transition  capital and other asset related expenses  duplicate operating expenses and contract termination costs in connection with the restructuring 
we currently estimate that the pre tax charges and capital expenditures resulting from the restructuring will be between million and million 
this amount is expected to be incurred beginning in the first quarter of and continuing up through and including the second quarter of of this amount  approximately million to million are expected to be cash expenditures 
we also estimate that the restructuring will yield annual operating cost reductions of between million and million 
the foregoing estimates are based on assumptions relating to  among other things  a reduction of r d and general and administrative positions in the affected european locations and charges associated with the reduction 
these workforce reduction activities are currently expected to begin in the second quarter of and to be completed by the close of the second quarter of charges associated with the workforce reduction are currently expected to be recorded beginning in the first quarter of and to be completed by the close of the second quarter of as set forth above  the number of positions impacted and the final costs incurred will depend in part on the outcome of the above referenced consultations and negotiations and certain employees decisions with respect to transfer opportunities 
we are unable at this time to estimate the ultimate cost of the workforce reduction 

table of contents estimated restructuring charges also include approximately million to million for contract and lease termination costs and asset write offs primarily for leasehold improvements in facilities to be exited 
these costs are currently expected to be recorded beginning in the second quarter of and are expected to be completed by the close of the second quarter of estimated implementation and transition related expenses include  among other things  legal  consulting  recruiting  information system implementation costs and taxes 
these costs are currently expected to total approximately million to million  and are expected to be recorded beginning in the first quarter of and continuing up through and including the second quarter of we also expect to incur duplicate operating expenses during the transition period to ensure that job knowledge and skills are properly transferred to new employees 
these duplicate operating expenses are currently expected to total between million and million  and are expected to be recorded beginning in the second quarter of and continuing up through and including the first quarter of we also expect to incur additional capital expenditures for leasehold improvements primarily at our high wycombe  uk facility or a new facility in the uk to accommodate increased headcount 
these capital expenditures are currently estimated to be between million and million  and are expected to be recorded beginning in the second quarter of and continuing up through and including the fourth quarter of we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our existing credit facilities and existing cash and equivalents  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our revenues in were derived from operations outside the united states  and a portion of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we routinely monitor our transaction exposure to currency rates and implement certain economic hedging strategies to limit such exposure  as appropriate 
the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our sales was as follows a million increase in  a million increase in  and a million decrease in the sales increase included million related to the euro  million related to the british pound  million related to the canadian dollar  million related to the australian dollar  million related to the japanese yen and million related to the brazilian real 
the sales increase included increases of million related to the euro  million related to the canadian dollar  million related to the australian dollar and million related to the japanese yen  partially offset by decreases of million related to the mexican peso  million related to the brazilian real and million related to other latin american currencies 
the sales decrease included decreases of million related to the brazilian real and million related to other latin american currencies  partially offset by an million increase related to the euro 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for a description of our accounting policy on foreign currency translation 
oculex pharmaceuticals  inc on november   we purchased all of the outstanding equity interests of oculex pharmaceuticals  inc  or oculex  a privately owned company  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  
table of contents net of cash acquired  including transaction costs of million and million in other assets related to oculex 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the consolidated statements of operations include the results of oculex beginning november  in conjunction with the acquisition  we recorded a charge to research and development for in process research and development expense of million during for an acquired in process research and development asset which we determined was not yet complete and had no alternative future uses in its current state 
this asset is oculex s lead investigational product  posurdex  which is a proprietary  bioerodable  sustained release implant that delivers dexamethasone to the targeted disease site at the back of the eye 
we have begun phase clinical trials for macular edema associated with diabetes and vein occlusions 
additionally  we determined that the assets acquired also included a proprietary technology drug delivery platform which had alternative future uses in its current state  which we separately valued and capitalized as core technology 
the core technology is a versatile bioerodable polymer drug delivery technology which can be used for sustained local delivery of compounds to the eye 
see note  acquisitions  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for a discussion of the acquisition of oculex 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
a summary of the net assets acquired follows in millions current assets property  plant and equipment capitalized intangible core technology straight line amortization over a year useful life in process research and development other non current assets  primarily deferred tax assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities during  we adjusted the fair value of certain net assets acquired by million  which resulted in a decrease in the amount of capitalized core technology and in process research and development of million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in in process research and development was included in research and development expenses in bardeen sciences company  llc on may   we completed an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of bardeen sciences company  llc  or bardeen  from farallon pharma investors  llc  or farallon  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including transaction costs of million and million in certain intangible contract based product marketing and other rights  net of cash acquired 
we acquired all of bardeen s assets  which consisted of the rights to certain pharmaceutical compounds under development and research projects  including memantine  androgen tears  tazarotene in oral form for the treatment of acne  agn  agn  agn  a hypotensive lipid timolol combination  a photodynamic therapy project  tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of ocular neovascularization  a vision sparing project and a retinal disease project 
bardeen was formed in april upon our contribution of a portfolio of pharmaceutical compounds and research projects and the commitment of a million capital investment by farallon 
in return for our contribution of the portfolio  we received certain commercialization rights to market products developed from the compounds comprising the portfolio 
in addition  we acquired an option to purchase rights to any one product and a separate option to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of bardeen at an option price based on the amount of research and development funds expended by bardeen on the portfolio and the time elapsed since the effective date of the option agreement 
we acquired bardeen upon the exercise of our option to purchase all the outstanding equity interests of bardeen at the option price 
neither we nor any of our 
table of contents officers or directors owned any interest in bardeen or farallon prior to the acquisition of the outstanding interests 
we determined that the assets acquired consisted entirely of incomplete in process research and development assets and that these assets had no alternative future uses in their current state 
the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as follows in millions intangible assets in process research and development accounts payable from the time of bardeen s formation until the acquisition date  we performed research and development on the compounds comprising the portfolio on bardeen s behalf pursuant to a research and development services agreement between us and bardeen under which all such activities were fully funded by bardeen and services were performed on a cost plus basis 
because the financial risk associated with the research and development was transferred to bardeen  we recognized revenues and related costs as services were performed under such agreements as required under sfas no 
 research and development arrangements 
these amounts are included in research service revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in research revenues  respectively  and million and million in research costs  respectively  under the research and development services agreement with bardeen 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for activities relating to foreign currency risk management 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure you that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 
we have recorded current changes in the fair value of open foreign currency option contracts as unrealized losses on derivative instruments  net  and we have recorded the gains and losses realized from settled option contracts in other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we have recorded all unrealized and realized gains and losses from foreign currency forward contracts through other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents  interest expense on our debt as well as costs associated with foreign currency contracts 

table of contents at december   we had million of variable rate debt 
if the interest rates on the variable rate debt were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million

we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures
