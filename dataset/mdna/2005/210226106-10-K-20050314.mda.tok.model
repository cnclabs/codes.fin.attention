the company lands are well located in the growing central florida interstate corridor  providing an excellent opportunity for reasonably stable land sales in the near term future and following years 
with its substantial land holdings in daytona beach  the company has parcels available for the entire spectrum of real estate uses 
along with land sales  the company selectively develops parcels primarily for commercial uses 
sales and development activity on and around company owned lands have been strong in the last three years

bayberry had purchased the first phase of the development  which consisted of acres  in these development and sales activities  along with additional activities such as the development of the second phase of the grand preserve residential community  construction of a fourth professional office building north of the surgical and imaging center  construction of a middle school  the development of the second phase of daytona beach auto mall  and the future relocation of halifax medical center all in the lpga boulevard corridor  tend to create additional buyer interest and sales opportunities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in the year  the company initiated a strategy of investing in income properties utilizing the proceeds of land sales qualifying for income tax deferral through like kind exchange treatment for tax purposes 
at the end of  the company had invested approximately million in sixteen income properties through this process with an additional million held by a qualified intermediary for investment in additional properties

golf operations consist of the operation of the two golf courses  clubhouse facility  and food and beverage activities within the lpga international mixed use residential community on the west side of interstate  south and east of lpga boulevard 
the champions course was designed by reese jones and the legends course was designed by arthur hills 
over the last two years  golf revenues have grown while profits have shown small improvements  despite an overall decline in golf course revenues in florida 
the florida golf industry has been hurt by over building of golf courses and a general economic downturn  which began to show improvement in late and early the four hurricanes  which florida experienced in s late summer and early fall  also had an impact on the golf business 
while little damage was sustained from the hurricanes  business virtually came to a standstill for several weeks as locals were preoccupied with cleanup and repair and tourism was non existent 
improvement in golf course operations is a function of increased tourist demand  reduction in new golf course construction experienced in the last several years  and increased residential growth in lpga international and adjoining land to the west and northwest 
lpga international and nearby projects currently under development are planned to contain about  additional dwelling units 
food and banquet service revenues at the clubhouse  which opened in january  have improved annually with revenues increasing in despite down time due to the severe weather experienced 
improvement over time is a function of the same factors impacting the golf courses increased demand and new home construction 
the company s efforts to improve revenues and profitability have focused on providing quality products and services while maintaining consistent and stringent cost control for golf course and food service activities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during the company s federal income tax return was examined by the internal revenue service irs 
a notice of proposed adjustment has been received by the company 
the irs is questioning the deferral of gains for tax purposes on three transactions  which took place on lands within the company s development of regional impact 
nine additional sales transactions  on which the company deferred gains  were not contested by the irs 
the proposed adjustment totals approximately million of taxable income 
if the irs prevails  the adjustment would result in federal income taxes becoming currently due in the amount of approximately million 
the company has adequate funds  from cash and investments  as they mature  operating activities and current financing sources  to pay the taxes should they become currently due 
the adjustment would not have an impact on earnings as it would be a balance sheet reclassification from deferred income taxes payable to current income taxes payable 
the adjustment would have an impact on earnings before depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes 
the company and its tax advisors believe that the income tax treatment for these transactions was appropriate and are in the process of disputing the proposed adjustment 
risks and competition the real estate business is subject to a number of economic factors including the impact of rising and falling interest rates  which affect the ability of purchasers to obtain financing and population growth  which impacts supply and demand for new homes  as well as goods and services  and hence land to meet those needs 
also impacting the ability to sell land are the availability of roads and utilities  environmental impacts  density limitations  urban growth boundaries  and other factors associated with national  regional or local economic and political conditions 
all of these factors have an impact on the company s three lines of business and their success 
most directly impacted is the real estate sales and development business currently centered in the daytona beach market 
pricing levels and changes by the company and its immediate competitors can affect sales  although the company generally enjoys a competitive edge due to low costs associated with long time land ownership and a significant ownership position in the immediate market

further  ebddt is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the company believes  however  that ebddt provides relevant information about operations and is useful  along with net income  for an understanding of the company s operating results 
ebddt is calculated by adding depreciation  amortization  and deferred income taxes to net income as they represent non cash charges 
ebddt rose the year ended december  when compared to s results based not only on the higher income generated during the year but also on greater depreciation associated with the larger inventory of income properties
