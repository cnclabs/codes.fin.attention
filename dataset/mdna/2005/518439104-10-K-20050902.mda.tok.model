mrs 
est e lauder formulated this marketing philosophy to provide high quality service and products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base 
our marketing efforts focus principally on promoting the quality and benefits of our products 
each of our brands is distinctively positioned  has a single global image  and is promoted with consistent logos  packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands 
we regularly advertise our products on television and radio  in upscale magazines and newspapers and through direct mail and photo displays at international airports 
in addition  our products receive extensive editorial coverage in prestige publications and other media worldwide 
promotional activities and in store displays are designed to introduce existing consumers to different products in the line and to attract new consumers 
our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with retailers  some of which are supported by coordinated promotions  such as purchase with purchase and gift with purchase 
at in store counters  sales representatives offer personal demonstrations to market individual products as well as to provide education on basic skin care and makeup application 
we conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program 
we believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers 
starting with the launch of the clinique website in  we have used the internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands 
currently  we have eighteen single brand marketing sites  twelve of which have e commerce capabilities  and gloss 
com  our majority owned  multi brand marketing and e commerce site 
most of our creative marketing work is done by in house creative teams 
the creative staff designs and produces the sales materials  advertisements and packaging for all products in each brand 
total advertising and promotional expenditures were  million   million and  million for fiscal  and  respectively 
these amounts include expenses relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales 
our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers and key retailers and consulting with sales representatives at the points of sale 
these include est e lauder beauty advisors  clinique consultants  aramis selling specialists  prescriptives analysts  origins guides and m a c makeup artists 
information systems information systems support business processes including product development  marketing  sales  order processing  production  distribution and finance 
of the many systems currently being utilized  the most significant to our business needs are i a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer  or plan to offer  which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality  ii a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit sku level at most significant retail sales locations ie  sell through data  increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development  manufacturing and marketing strategies  iii an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers  allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically  with minimal paperwork  and iv an inventory management system to provide us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to actual requirements  facilitating inventory control and distribution for both existing product lines and new product launches 
the efficiencies provided by these systems have resulted in increased sales  fewer out of stocks and reduced retail inventories 
we expect that these systems will continue to provide inventory and sales efficiencies in the short and medium terms 
as part of our long term effort to enhance these efficiencies  we are implementing enterprise wide global programs that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data  processes and technologies  which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands  operating units and sales affiliates 
research and development we believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products 
marketing  product development and packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in consumer preferences  develop new products and redesign or reformulate existing products 
in addition  research and development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations 
we maintain ongoing research and development programs at our facilities in melville  new york  oevel  belgium  petersfield  uk  tokyo  japan  markham  ontario  blaine  minnesota  and colombes  france 
we are also in the process of opening a research center in shanghai  china 
construction of the shanghai research and development center started in june and we expect to have operations running by the latter part of as of june   we had approximately employees engaged in research and development 
research and development expenditures totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our research and development group makes significant contributions toward improving existing products and developing new products and provides ongoing technical assistance and know how to our manufacturing activities 
the research and development group has had long standing working relationships with several us and international medical and educational facilities  which supplement internal capabilities 
we do not conduct animal testing of our products 
manufacturing  warehousing and raw materials we manufacture skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products in the united states  belgium  switzerland  the united kingdom  canada and france 
we continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation  increase efficiencies and reduce costs 
our major manufacturing facilities operate as focus plants that primarily manufacture one type of product eg  lipsticks for all of the principal brands 
our plants are modern and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated 
while we believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements  we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity and productivity 
to capitalize on innovation and other supply benefits  we continue to utilize third parties on a global basis for finished goods production 
we have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels 
we are continuously evaluating and restructuring this physical distribution network 
we intend to establish regional inventory centers strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate timely delivery of our products to our customers 
the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils  alcohol and specialty chemicals 
we also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications 
procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our centralized supplier relations department 
a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization has been made with the specific objective of reducing costs  increasing innovation and improving quality 
as a result of sourcing initiatives  there is increased dependency on certain suppliers  but we believe that these suppliers have adequate resources and facilities to overcome any unforeseen interruption of supply 
we are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will add or delete suppliers based upon the changing needs of the business 
we have  in the past  been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products 
as we integrate acquired brands  we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve manufacturing performance 
competition the skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world 
brand recognition  quality  performance and price have a significant influence on consumers choices among competing products and brands 
advertising  promotion  merchandising  the pace and timing of new product introductions  line extensions and the quality of in store sales staff also have a significant impact on consumers buying decisions 
we compete against a number of manufacturers and marketers of skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products  some of which have substantially greater resources than we do 
our principal competitors among manufacturers and marketers of skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products include l oreal sa  which markets lanc me  ralph lauren  giorgio armani  garnier  l oreal  maybelline  biotherm  helena rubinstein  redken  matrix  kiehl s since  shu uemura  skinceuticals and other brands  unilever nv  which markets dove  pond s  thermasilk  vaseline intensive care and other brands  the procter gamble company  which markets cover girl  olay  giorgio beverly hills  hugo boss  rochas  escada  lacoste  max factor  vidal sassoon  pantene  clairol  wella  valentino  gucci  sebastian  aussie and other brands  beiersdorf ag  which markets nivea  eucerin  la prairie  juvena and other brands  avon products inc  a direct marketer of avon color  anew  skin so soft  mark  avon wellness  and becoming  and other products  shiseido company  ltd  which markets shiseido  cl de peau beaut  zirh  nars  decl or  issey miyake  jean paul gaultier  helene curtis  za and other brands  lvmh mo t hennessey louis vuitton lvmh  which markets christian dior  kenzo  givenchy  guerlain  benefit  make up for ever  fresh  aqua di parma and other brands  coty  inc  which markets lancaster  davidoff  isabella rossellini  rimmel  astor  adidas  the healing garden  chopard  jennifer lopez  kenneth cole  marc jacobs  sarah jessica parker  david and victoria beckham  stetson  calvin klein  cerruti  vera wang and other brands  revlon  inc  which markets revlon  almay  ultima ii and other brands  chanel  inc  clarins sa  which markets clarins  azzaro  lacoste  thierry mugler and other brands  and elizabeth arden  inc  which markets elizabeth arden  elizabeth taylor fragrances  geoffrey beene  halston  britney spears and other brands 
we also face competition from retailers that have developed their own brands  such as gap inc  which markets the gap and banana republic products  limited brands inc  which markets victoria s secret beauty and bath and body works  and sephora 
some retailers have acquired brands  such as neiman marcus group  which acquired laura mercier

seasonality our results of operations in total  by region and by product category  are subject to seasonal fluctuations  with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year

fluctuations in net sales  operating income and product category results in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions 
additionally  gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter by quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions  including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions

risk factors 
there are risks associated with an investment in our securities  including the beauty business is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer 
we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world  including multinational consumer product companies 
some of these competitors have greater resources than we do 
competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products  innovation  perceived value  service to the consumer  promotional activities  advertising  special events  new product introductions  electronic commerce initiatives and other activities 
it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors actions in these areas 
also  the trend toward consolidation in the retail trade  particularly in developed markets such as the united states and western europe  has resulted in us becoming increasingly dependent on key retailers  including large format retailers  who have increased their bargaining strength 
our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands  our ability to attract and retain key talent  the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network  and our ability to protect our intellectual property 
our failure to continue to compete effectively in countries around the world could have an adverse impact on our business 
our inability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences could adversely affect our financial results 
our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate  gauge and react in a timely and cost effective manner to changes in consumer tastes for skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products as well as to where and how consumers shop for those products 
we must continually work to develop  produce and market new products  maintain and enhance the recognition of our brands  achieve a favorable mix of products  and refine our approach as to how and where we market and sell our products 
while we devote considerable effort and resources to shape  analyze and respond to consumer preferences  we recognize that consumer tastes cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for cosmetics products and changing consumer demands  our financial results will suffer 
a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items  which could adversely affect our financial results 
the general level of consumer spending is affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  inflation  interest rates  energy costs  and consumer confidence generally  all of which are beyond our control 
consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods  when disposable income is lower  and may impact sales of our products 
in addition  sudden disruptions in business conditions  for example  as a consequence of events such as the outbreak of sars in or those that are currently taking place in the middle east  or as a result of a terrorist attack similar to the events of september  in the united states or the july events in the united kingdom  including further attacks  retaliation and the threat of further attacks or retaliation can have a short and  sometimes  long term impact on consumer spending 
events that impact consumers willingness to travel may impact our travel retail business  which is a significant contributor to our overall results 
a downturn in the economies in which we sell our products or a sudden disruption of business conditions in those economies could adversely affect our sales 
changes in laws  regulations and polices that affect our business could adversely affect our financial results 
our business is subject to numerous laws  regulations and policies 
changes in the laws  regulations and policies that affect  or will affect  our business  including changes in accounting standards  tax laws and regulations  trade rules and customs regulations  and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings  and any action we may take as a result could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to risks related to our international operations 
we operate on a global basis  with approximately of our fiscal net sales generated outside the united states 
we maintain offices in over countries and have key operational facilities located outside the united states that manufacture goods for sale throughout the world 
foreign operations are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which can affect our results of operations  the value of our foreign assets  the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell products in the same markets  and the cost of certain items required in our operations  changes in foreign laws  regulations and policies  including restrictions on trade  import and export license requirements  and tariffs and taxes  as well as changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment  and geopolitical conditions  such as terrorist attacks  war or other military action 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
a disruption in operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 
as a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale  we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities  including industrial accidents  environmental events  strikes and other labor disputes  disruptions in logistics or information systems  loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites  product quality control  safety  licensing requirements and other regulatory issues  as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control 
if such an event were to occur  it could have an adverse affect on our business and financial results

item legal proceedings 
we are involved  from time to time  in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business 
management believes that the outcome of current litigation and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
however  management s assessment of our current litigation and other legal proceedings could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges  juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings 
on march   the united states district court for the northern district of california entered into a final judgment approving the settlement agreement we entered into in july  with the plaintiffs  the other manufacturer defendants as defined below and the department store defendants as defined below in a consolidated class action lawsuit that had been pending in the superior court of the state of california in marin county since on april   notices of appeal were filed by representatives of two members of the purported class of consumers 
if the appeal is resolved satisfactorily  the final judgment will result in the plaintiffs claims being dismissed  with prejudice  in their entirety in both the federal and california actions 
there has been no finding or admission of any wrongdoing by us in this lawsuit 
we entered into the settlement agreement solely to avoid protracted and costly litigation 
in connection with the settlement agreement  the defendants  including the company  will provide consumers with certain free products and pay the plaintiffs attorneys fees 
to meet its obligations under the settlement  we took a special pre tax charge of million  or million after tax  equal to 
per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal at june   the remaining accrual balance was million 
the charge did not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 
in the federal action  the plaintiffs  purporting to represent a class of all us residents who purchased prestige cosmetics products at retail for personal use from eight department stores groups that sold such products in the united states the department store defendants  alleged that the department store defendants  the company and eight other manufacturers of cosmetics the manufacturer defendants conspired to fix and maintain retail prices and to limit the supply of prestige cosmetics products sold by the department store defendants in violation of state and federal laws 
the plaintiffs sought  among other things  treble damages  equitable relief  attorneys fees  interest and costs 
in  the office of the attorney general of the state of new york the state notified the company and ten other entities that they are potentially responsible parties prps with respect to the blydenburgh landfill in islip  new york 
each prp may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and cleanup  which the state estimates to be million for all prps 
in  the state sued other prps including hickey s carting  inc  dennis c 
hickey and maria hickey  collectively the hickey parties  in the us district court for the eastern district of new york to recover such costs in connection with the site  and in september  the hickey parties brought contribution actions against the company and other blydenburgh prps 
these contribution actions seek to recover  among other things  any damages for which the hickey parties are found liable in the state s lawsuit against them  and related costs and expenses  including attorneys fees 
in june  the state added the company and other prps as defendants in its pending case against the hickey parties 
the company and certain other prps have engaged in settlement discussions which to date have been unsuccessful 
we have accrued an amount which we believe would be necessary to resolve our share of this matter 
if settlement discussions are not successful  we intend to vigorously defend the pending claims 
while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome  management believes that the resolution of the blydenburgh matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 
in january  the portuguese tax administration issued a report alleging that our subsidiary had income subject to tax in portugal for the three calendar years ended december  our subsidiary has been operating in the madeira free trade zone since under license from the madeira development corporation and  in accordance with such license and the laws of portugal  we believe that our income is not subject to portuguese income tax 
in february  the subsidiary filed an appeal of the finding to the portuguese secretary of state for fiscal matters 
the appeal is still pending 
on december   the subsidiary received a notice of assessment from the portuguese tax administration solely in respect of the calendar year ended december  the assessment  which includes interest  amounted to million euros 
at the end of march  the subsidiary filed an opposition to the assessment 
no action has been taken by the portuguese tax administration in respect of the opposition  which remains pending 
in august  the portuguese tax administration notified the subsidiary that it is beginning executive procedures to collect on the assessment for  and we are in the process of arranging the required financial guarantee 
on may and   the subsidiary received notices of assessment from the portuguese tax administration in respect of the calendar years ended december  and the assessments are for million euros and million euros  respectively  to which the subsidiary has filed oppositions in july while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome in respect of the foregoing assessments or any additional assessments that may be issued for subsequent periods  management believes that the likelihood that the assessment or any future assessments ultimately will be upheld is remote 
in december  a plaintiff purporting to represent a nationwide class brought an action in the superior court of california for the county of san diego 
the complaint  as amended  names two of our subsidiaries and approximately other defendants  including manufacturers and retailers

the purported class includes individuals who have purchased skin care products from defendants that have been falsely advertised to have an anti aging or youth inducing benefit or effect 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
i certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation for comparative purposes 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june  and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  concentration of credit risk  inventory  pension and other postretirement benefit costs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  and derivatives 
management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition revenues from merchandise sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership  including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods 
in the americas region  sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and  in the europe  middle east africa and asia pacific regions  sales are generally recognized based upon the customer s receipt 
in certain circumstances  transfer of title takes place at the point of sale eg  at our retail stores 
sales are reported on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received  discounts  incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns 
our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested  authorized and approved 
in accepting returns  we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer 
as a percentage of gross sales  returns were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns  estimated future returns and information provided by authorized retailers regarding their inventory levels 
consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations 
experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period  as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business 
in addition  as necessary  specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events 
the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered  and will continue to consider  include  but are not limited to  the solvency of our customers  store closings by retailers  changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue or support new and existing products 
concentration of credit risk an entity is vulnerable to concentration of credit risk if it is exposed to risks of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risks through diversification of customers 
the significance of such credit risk depends on the extent and nature of the concentration 
we have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for  million  or  of our consolidated net sales in fiscal and million  or  of our accounts receivable at june  these customers sell products primarily within north america 
our two largest customers  federated department stores  inc and the may department stores company  merged on august  although management believes that our major customers are sound and creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales  cash flows and or financial condition 
in the ordinary course of business  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of million and million as of june  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million  million and million for customer deductions and write offs in fiscal  and  respectively  and increased by million  million and million for additional provisions in fiscal  and  respectively 
this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging  specific exposures and historical trends 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale 
the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products  promotional products  raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods 
inventory cost includes raw materials  direct labor and overhead 
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age  historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales 
in addition  and as necessary  we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trust based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan us qualified plan and an unfunded  nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations collectively with the us qualified plan  the domestic plans  a contributory defined contribution plan  international pension plans  which vary by country  consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  deferred compensation  and certain other postretirement benefits 
the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables 
certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels 
we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 
the pre retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long term bonds 
for fiscal  we used a pre retirement discount rate for our domestic plans of and varying rates on our international plans of between and 
the pre retirement rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long term bonds with an aa rating  or equivalent  from a major rating agency 
we believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio is expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans 
for fiscal  we used an expected return on plan assets of for our us qualified plan and varying rates of between and for our international plans 
in determining the long term rate of return for a plan  we consider the historical rates of return  the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies 
the us qualified plan asset allocation as of june  was approximately equity investments  fixed income investments and other investments 
the asset allocation of our combined international plans as of june  was approximately equity investments  fixed income investments and other investments 
the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affects our recorded obligations and recognized expenses in such future periods 
for fiscal  our pension plans had actual returns on assets of million as compared with expected returns on assets of million  which resulted in a net deferred gain of million 
a basis point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal pension expense in millions basis point increase basis point decrease discount rate expected return on assets our postretirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates  which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal would have had the following effects in millions one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease effect on total service and interest costs effect on postretirement benefit obligations for fiscal  we will use a pre retirement discount rate for the domestic plans of and varying rates for our international plans of between and 
we anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of for the us qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between and 
the net change in these assumptions from those used in fiscal will cause approximately a million increase in pension expense in fiscal we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 
on an annual basis  or sooner if certain events or circumstances warrant  we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing 
we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose 
to mitigate undue influence  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we have current net deferred tax assets of million and non current net deferred tax liabilities of million 
the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization  as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates 
included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately million for deferred tax assets  which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date  where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction 
based on our assessments  no additional valuation allowance is required 
if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 
we provide tax reserves for federal  state  local and international exposures relating to audit results  tax planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities 
the development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and is a subjective critical estimate 
although the outcome of these tax audits is uncertain  in management s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities emanating from these reviews 
if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates  they could have a material impact on our results of operations 
derivatives we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
this statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 
we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates  as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
hedge effectiveness is documented  assessed and monitored by employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments 
variables that are external to us such as social  political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof 
for a discussion on the quantitative impact of market risks related to our derivative financial instruments  refer to liquidity and capital resources market risk 
quantitative analysis during the three year period ended june   there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies  nor to the related significant estimates  since the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations 
while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects  other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales  cost of sales  operating expenses or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes 
for fiscal  had these estimates been changed simultaneously by in either direction  our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately million  operating expenses would have changed by approximately million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
the collective impact of these changes on operating income  net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately million  million and  respectively 
results of operations we manufacture  market and sell skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over countries and territories 
the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal  and and reflects the basis of presentation described in note and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category 
in february  we sold the assets and operations of our reporting unit that sold jane brand products 
based on an assessment of the tangible and intangible assets of this business  we determined that the carrying amount of these assets as then reflected on our consolidated balance sheets exceeded their estimated fair value 
accordingly  we recorded an after tax charge to discontinued operations of million for the fiscal year ended june  the charge represented the impairment of goodwill in the amount of million  the reduction in value of other tangible assets of million  net of tax  and the operating loss of million  net of tax  for the fiscal year ended june  included in that operating loss were additional costs associated with the sale and discontinuation of the business

the economics of developing  producing and launching these new products influence our sales and operating performance each period 
the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products  which we take into account in our business planning 
net sales net sales increased or million to  million reflecting growth in all major product categories  led by makeup and skin care  and growth in all geographic regions  led by europe  the middle east africa 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased product categories skin care net sales of skin care products increased or million to  million

on a combined basis  strong sales of products in clinique s step skin care system and the lifting face serum the lifting intensifier by la mer contributed approximately million to the sales increase 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately million in sales of perfectionist correcting serum for lines wrinkles  idealist micro d deep thermal refinisher  and the white light and lightsource lines of products by est e lauder 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  skin care net sales increased 
makeup makeup net sales increased or million to  million

excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  makeup net sales increased 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products increased or million to  million 
the increase was due to approximately million in sales generated by the fiscal launches of dkny be delicious and dkny be delicious men  true star from tommy hilfiger  lauder beyond paradise men from est e lauder  happy to be from clinique and donald trump the fragrance 
partially offsetting the new product sales were decreases in sales of approximately million of est e lauder beyond paradise  aramis life and clinique simply  which were launched in the prior year  as well as decreases in sales of approximately million of tommy jeans and tommy from tommy hilfiger  certain other aramis products and lauder intuition men from est e lauder 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  fragrance net sales increased slightly 
we expect the fragrance category to remain challenging in fiscal hair care hair care net sales increased to million 
this increase amounting to million was due to sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble products 
aveda net sales increased as a result of sales of new professional color products and the introductions of pure abundance and damage remedy hair care products  while bumble and bumble benefited from recent launches in its hair and scalp treatment line of products and the initial shipments of cr me de coco shampoos and conditioners 
both of these brands also benefited from new points of distribution 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  hair care net sales increased 
geographic regions net sales in the americas increased or million to  million 
this region experienced growth in all major categories which was fueled by the diversification in our product offerings as new products and brands mitigated challenges among certain core brands and successful prior year launches 
in the united states  our makeup artist and hair care brands along with products from our aramis and designer fragrances division contributed approximately million to the increase 
in addition  higher net sales in canada and the inclusion of beautybank products contributed approximately million  collectively 
the americas region may be adversely impacted by the august merger of federated department stores  inc and the may department stores company 
in europe  the middle east africa  net sales increased or million to  million primarily due to higher net sales in the united kingdom  our travel retail business  spain  portugal  south africa and greece of approximately million  collectively

net sales in asia pacific increased or million to million 
this increase reflected higher net sales of approximately million in china  hong kong  australia and taiwan  partially offset by lower sales in japan of approximately million 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  asia pacific net sales increased 
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was and remained unchanged compared with the prior year 
favorable net changes in production and supply chain efforts of approximately basis points  primarily driven by favorable material sourcing  were offset by the net change in the mix of our business within our geographic regions and product categories  as discussed above  which includes the impact of the beautybank brands 
changes in exchange rates compared with the prior year had a de minimis net impact on our cost of sales margin 
the higher price of oil is beginning to impact our cost of raw materials and componentry  however  we believe this will not have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales margin in the near future 
since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage 
in addition  future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different from those of our existing brands 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved to from in the prior fiscal year 
our planned increase in advertising  merchandising and sampling over the prior year of approximately basis points was offset in full by our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs 
we also realized a benefit of approximately basis points from the elimination of royalty payments previously made to mrs 
est e lauder 
in fiscal  we will experience an increase in operating expenses due to the recognition of costs related to employee stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment see recently issued accounting standards 
changes in advertising  sampling and merchandising spending result from the type  timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts  as well as the markets being emphasized 
operating results based on the growth of net sales  our constant cost of sales margin and the improvement in our operating expense margin as previously discussed  operating income increased or million to million as compared with the prior fiscal year 
operating margins were of net sales in the current period as compared with in the prior fiscal year 
product categories operating income increased or million in makeup and or million in skin care reflecting overall sales growth and sales of recently launched products 
operating results also increased or million in fragrance reflecting sales growth from new and recently launched products 
while we experienced improved results in fiscal due to these new launches  the fragrance business continues to be challenging 
hair care operating results decreased or million reflecting an increase in operating expenses related to the growth of our business in the united states as well as the opening of new points of distribution in korea and japan  partially offset by increases in net sales as previously discussed 
hair care results were also adversely impacted in fiscal by the need to make alternative arrangements due to the bankruptcy of a third party supplier 
the situation was rectified during fiscal geographic regions operating income in the americas increased or million to million  primarily due to higher net sales resulting from an overall improvement in the retail environment  strong product launches and growth from our newer brands 
as noted above  we expect results in the americas region to be adversely impacted by the august merger of federated department stores  inc and the may department stores company 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased or million to million primarily due to improved results from our travel retail business  spain  the united kingdom and switzerland of approximately million  collectively 
partially offsetting this improvement were lower results in france  which was negatively impacted by the consolidation of major retailers  and in russia  where we converted our business from a distributor to a direct subsidiary  of approximately million on a combined basis 
in asia pacific  operating income increased or million to million 
this increase reflected improved results in hong kong  taiwan  thailand and japan of approximately million  collectively  partially offset by a decrease in operating income in korea and china of approximately million  combined 
as china is an emerging market for us  we have invested  and plan to continue to invest  in new brand expansion and business opportunities 
in addition  the asia pacific region did not realize the benefits of spending behind new whitening products  which experienced a delay in launching during fiscal interest expense  net net interest expense was million as compared with million in the prior year 
the decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a million decrease in preferred stock dividends as a result of the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of the preferred stock on june  and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining million of the preferred stock 
this improvement was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of higher debt balances and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was as compared with in the prior year 
the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions  the effect of repatriating foreign earnings and certain nondeductible expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately million of foreign earnings in fiscal  which includes million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of the ajca 
this action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately million in fiscal  which included an incremental tax charge of approximately million 
the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the incremental tax charge resulting from the repatriation plan of approximately basis points and an increase of approximately basis points resulting from our foreign operations 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the amount of nondeductible preferred stock dividends of approximately basis points  a decrease in state and local income taxes of approximately basis points and an increase in tax credits of approximately basis points

net earnings as compared with the prior fiscal year improved million to million and diluted net earnings per common share improved to from

the planned repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the ajca  as discussed above  resulted in an incremental tax charge of approximately million  or per diluted common share 
as noted above  net earnings in fiscal are expected to be adversely impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
in addition  we expect results in the americas region to be adversely impacted by the august merger of federated department stores  inc and the may department stores company 
fiscal as compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased or million to  million  reflecting growth in all product categories and all geographic regions led by double digit growth in europe  the middle east africa and asia pacific and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the darphin line of products  which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal net sales results in europe  the middle east africa and asia pacific benefited from the weakening of the us dollar 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased 
product categories skin care net sales of skin care products increased or million to  million 
approximately million of this increase was attributable to the new launches of hydra complete multi level moisture cream and idealist micro d deep thermal refinisher by est e lauder and pore minimizer by clinique 
additionally  growth of approximately million was due to strong sales of clinique s step skin care system and the repairwear line of products from clinique  re nutriv intensive lift serum and re nutriv intensive eye cr me by est e lauder and the inclusion of a full year of net sales of the darphin line of products  which are primarily skin care

excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  skin care net sales increased 
makeup makeup net sales increased or million to  million  in part  due to net sales increases of our m a c and bobbi brown makeup artist lines of approximately million  collectively

excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  makeup net sales increased 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products increased or million to  million  primarily attributable to the fiscal launches of est e lauder beyond paradise  aramis life  clinique simply and the tommy jeans collection  which together contributed approximately million to the growth 
these product launches primarily contributed to increased fragrance net sales outside the united states and are inclusive of improved results from our travel retail business 
these net sales increases were partially offset by lower net sales of est e lauder pleasures  intuition and beautiful  certain tommy hilfiger products and clinique happy of approximately million  collectively 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  fragrance net sales increased 
hair care hair care net sales increased or million to million 
this increase resulted from sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble products due to an increase in sales at existing salons and spas  new salon and spa openings and the success of new and existing products 
aveda net sales also increased as a result of the opening of new company owned aveda experience centers 
partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of clinique s simple hair care system

we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to from reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies of approximately basis points and lower costs from promotional activities of approximately basis points 
partially offsetting these improvements were changes in exchange rates of approximately basis points and costs related to inventory obsolescence and reconditioning and re handling of goods of approximately basis points 
also offsetting these improvements were costs associated with higher travel retail sales  which contributed approximately basis points 
travel retail has a higher cost of goods sold percentage because of its higher mix of fragrance sales coupled with its margin structure 
since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage 
in addition  future cost of sales mix may be impacted by the inclusion of new brands which have margin and product cost structures different than our existing brands 
operating expenses our fiscal results  as reported in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  included an adjustment for a special pre tax charge of million  or million after tax  equal to 
per diluted common share  in connection with the proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit brought against us and a number of other defendants 
the amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than similar charges we have incurred individually or in the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year  and  at that time  we did not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like it in the near future 
in the following discussions  we include the results as reported and the non gaap results 
we have presented the non gaap results because of the special nature of the charge  which affects comparability from period to period 
we believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and results of continuing operations 
this is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods 
there were no events or transactions subsequent to fiscal for which we believe such a discussion would be relevant 
in fiscal  operating expenses and operating income in accordance with gaap were  million or of net sales and million or of net sales  respectively 
before the charge non gaap results operating expenses would have been  million or of net sales and operating income would have been million or of net sales 
while we consider the non gaap financial measures useful in analyzing our results  it is not intended to replace  or act as a substitute for  any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap 
fiscal operating expenses decreased to of net sales as compared with of net sales in fiscal before considering the effect of the special charge  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points from in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately basis points primarily due to the higher growth rate in net sales  particularly in the travel retail business  as well as our ongoing cost containment efforts to maintain expenses in line with our business needs  partially offset by operating expenses related to beautybank  the higher operating costs associated with newly acquired brands and expenses related to compliance with new regulatory requirements such as those arising under the sarbanes oxley act of 
partially offsetting the net favorability in fiscal were higher levels of advertising  merchandising and sampling expenses incurred to support new and recently launched products of approximately basis points 
changes in advertising  sampling and merchandising spending result from the type  timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts  as well as the markets being emphasized 
under agreements covering our purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales  royalty payments totaling million and million in fiscal and  respectively  have been charged to expense 
such payments were made to mrs 
est e lauder until her death on april   after which time the final payments ceased to accrue and were made to a trust 
this event resulted in a reduction of operating expenses in fiscal of million  or million after tax 
we realized a benefit from the elimination of these royalty payments in fiscal operating results operating income increased or million to million 
operating margins were of net sales in fiscal as compared with in fiscal absent the special charge  operating income increased or million and operating margins increased basis points from fiscal these increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth  improvements in the components of cost of sales and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share increased approximately and  respectively 
net earnings improved million to million and diluted net earnings per common share increased by from to 
net earnings from continuing operations increased by million or and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased to from in the prior year 
absent the special charge  net earnings from continuing operations increased by million or and diluted net earnings per common share from continuing operations increased from 
the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of the fiscal special charge 
we believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
product categories operating income increased to million in skin care  to million in makeup and to million in hair care reflecting overall sales growth and new product launches 
operating income decreased to million in fragrance reflecting the softness in that product category in the united states as well as increased support spending related to new product launch activities 
geographic regions operating income in the americas increased or million to million due to sales growth resulting from an improved retail environment  strong product launches and growth from newer brands 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased or million to million primarily due to significantly improved results from our travel retail business  improved operating results in the united kingdom and spain as well as the addition of a full year of results of the darphin line of products  all of which contributed approximately million to the increase 
partially offsetting these increases were approximately million of lower gains on foreign exchange transactions and lower results in switzerland and italy due to difficult market conditions  collectively 
in asia pacific  operating income increased or million to million 
this increase reflected improved results in taiwan  hong kong and thailand  partially offset by lower results in korea  of approximately million  combined 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million as compared with million in fiscal the increase in net interest expense was due to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock of million as interest expense in fiscal this change in reporting resulted from a change in accounting standards which prohibited us from restating fiscal results 
to a lesser extent  interest expense was also affected by higher average net borrowings and a marginally higher effective interest rate on our debt portfolio 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was as compared with in fiscal these rates differ from statutory rates  reflecting the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
the increase in the effective income tax rate was attributable to the inclusion of the dividends on redeemable preferred stock as interest expense  which are not deductible for income tax purposes approximately basis points  the mix of global earnings approximately basis points and  to a lesser extent  the timing of certain tax planning initiatives 
the fiscal rate included benefits derived from certain favorable tax negotiations approximately basis points 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper  borrowings from the issuance of long term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared with million at june  at june   our outstanding borrowings of million included i million of senior notes due january consisting of million principal  unamortized debt discount of million and a million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap  ii million of senior notes due october consisting of million principal and unamortized debt discount of million  iii million of preferred stock  which shares have been put to us and we intend to redeem them on october   iv a billion yen term loan approximately million at the exchange rate at june   which is due in march  v a million euro note approximately million at the exchange rate at june  payable semi annually through february at a variable interest rate  vi million of capital lease obligations  vii million of outstanding short term commercial paper payable through july at an average interest rate of  and viii million of other short term borrowings 
we have a million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states 
our commercial paper is currently rated a by standard poor s and p by moody s 
our long term credit ratings are a with a stable outlook by standard poor s and a with a stable outlook by moody s 
at june   we had million of commercial paper outstanding  which is being refinanced on a periodic basis as it matures at then prevailing market interest rates 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to an additional million in debt securities and million in additional uncommitted credit facilities  of which million was used as of june  effective may   we entered into a five year million senior revolving credit facility  expiring on may  the new facility replaced our prior  unused million revolving credit facility  which was effective since june  the new revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including financing working capital  and also as credit support for our commercial paper program 
up to the equivalent of million of the facility is available for multi currency loans 
the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime  which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent  or plus the federal funds rate 
we incurred debt issuance costs of million which will be amortized over the term of the facility 
the credit facility has an annual fee of million  payable quarterly  based on our current credit ratings 
as of june   this facility was unused  and we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants  including limitations on indebtedness and liens 
on june   we received a notice of exercise of the put right from the holder of the remaining million of the preferred stock  which requires us to purchase the preferred stock  plus any cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon  on or before october  we plan to purchase the preferred stock on that date and to pay the anticipated dividends from july  through that date of million at a rate based on the after tax yield on six month us treasuries of  which was reset on july  our business is seasonal in nature and  accordingly  our working capital needs vary 
from time to time  we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding 
to the extent that our needs exceed cash from operations  we could  subject to market conditions  issue commercial paper  issue long term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility 
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was at june  as compared with at june  this increase primarily reflected the issuance of short term commercial paper in the fourth quarter of fiscal the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years 
generally  we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases  which have been moderate 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash generated from operations  available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the net decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal as compared with fiscal reflected changes in certain working capital accounts  partially offset by decreases in net deferred taxes and an increase in net earnings from continuing operations 
the change in other accrued liabilities primarily reflected the payment of significant deferred compensation and supplemental payments made to retired executives in fiscal accounts receivable increased as a result of sales growth in the current fiscal year  reflecting growth in international markets and customers which generally carry longer payment terms 
the timing of payments from certain domestic customers as well as shipments that occurred later in the period also contributed to increased accounts receivable 
the increase in inventory was primarily due to actual and anticipated sales levels  the building of safety stock in our new distribution center in europe  and  to a lesser extent  the inclusion of new points of distribution such as kohl s department stores for our beautybank brands and new affiliate activities 
the shift in cash activities related to accounts payable reflected the timing of disbursements year over year as well as the initiation of a vendor managed inventory program 
net deferred taxes decreased primarily as a result of the anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal as a result of the ajca and the realization of the tax benefits related to payments made to retired executives 
the improvement in net operating cash flows for fiscal as compared with fiscal reflected increased net earnings from continuing operations and an increase in accrued costs 
changes in operating assets and liabilities reflected partially offsetting increases in accounts payable and inventory in anticipation of product launches in fiscal  higher accounts receivable in line with sales growth  and changes in other assets and accrued liabilities that reflect receipts and accruals from employee compensation and benefit related transactions as well as selling  advertising and merchandising activities 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal and primarily related to capital expenditures

capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
incremental spending in fiscal primarily reflected the beginning of a company wide initiative to upgrade our information systems as well as the investment in leasehold improvements in our corporate offices 
we plan to continue to invest in the upgrade of our information systems in fiscal and beyond 
capital expenditures in fiscal and primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment  dies and molds  new store openings  store improvements  counter construction and information technology enhancements 
the lower level of capital expenditures in fiscal reflected tight control on our spending in light of then prevailing economic conditions 
cash used for financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal primarily reflected common stock repurchases and dividend payments  partially offset by the issuance of short term commercial paper to fund working capital needs and the receipt of proceeds from employee stock option transactions

dividends paid on the preferred stock were million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in preferred stock dividends in fiscal and primarily reflected the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of preferred stock on june  and the reduction in the dividend rate on the remaining million of the preferred stock

additionally  we have an unfunded  nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations 
our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans 
several factors influence our annual funding requirements 
for the us qualified plan  our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages 
such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes 
for each international plan  our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations 
in addition  amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in critical accounting polices and estimates 
the effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend on economic conditions  employee demographics  mortality rates  the number of participants electing to take lump sum distributions  investment performance and funding decisions 
for fiscal and  there was no minimum contribution to the us qualified plan required by erisa 
however  at management s discretion  we made cash contributions to the us qualified plan of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  we do not expect to make any cash contributions to the us qualified plan 
for fiscal and  we made benefit payments under our non qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of million and million  respectively 
we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal of million 
for fiscal and  we made cash contributions to our international pension plans of million and million  respectively 
we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal of million 
in addition  at june  and  we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and  accordingly  a benefit or a charge was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity for the change in such liability 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge  net of deferred tax  of million while in fiscal  we recorded a benefit  net of deferred tax  of million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
commitments and contingencies on june   we received a notice of exercise of the put right from the holder of the remaining million of the preferred stock  which requires us to purchase the preferred stock  plus any cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon  on or before october  we intend to purchase the preferred stock on that date and pay the anticipated dividends from july  through that date of million at a rate based on the after tax yield on six month us treasuries of  which was reset on july  certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn out provisions 
these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business 
the payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earn out payment will be made in fiscal since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business  we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 
for additional contingencies  refer to item legal proceedings 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june  payments due in fiscal total thereafter in millions debt service operating lease commitments unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations includes long term and short term debt and the related projected interest costs  and to a lesser extent  capital lease commitments 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
unconditional purchase obligations primarily include inventory commitments  estimated future earn out payments  estimated royalty payments pursuant to license agreements  advertising commitments  capital improvement commitments  planned funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and commitments pursuant to executive compensation arrangements 
future earn out payments and future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at june   without consideration for potential renewal periods 
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates 
we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 
for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment  we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value  cash flow  or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective  then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 
foreign exchange risk management we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries 
almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize 
the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as of june   these cash flow hedges were highly effective  in all material respects 
as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an a or equivalent credit rating 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized  but not realized  gains attributable to the contracts 
management believes risk of default under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results 
the contracts have varying maturities through the end of june costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the swiss franc million  british pound million  euro million  canadian dollar million  australian dollar million  japanese yen million and south korean won million 
the foreign currencies included in the option contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the japanese yen million  south korean won million  euro million and swiss franc million 
interest rate risk management we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness for periods consistent with the identified exposures 
all interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing million senior notes to variable interest rates based on six month libor 
we designated the swap as a fair value hedge 
as of june   the fair value hedge was highly effective  in all material respects 
market risk we use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments 
value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level 
we estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past day period 
the measured value at risk  calculated as an average  for the twelve months ended june  related to our foreign exchange contracts and our interest rate contracts was million and million  respectively 
the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 
our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results  which may or may not occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 
we believe  however  that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements 
this issue addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements in operating leases that are either a placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the initial lease term or b acquired in a business combination 
leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased 
leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition 
this issue shall be applied to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods after june  and we do not expect this issue to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations  to address the accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations associated with directive ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment the directive adopted by the european union eu 
the directive effectively obligates a commercial user to incur costs associated with the retirement of a specified asset that qualifies as historical waste equipment  as defined in the directive 
commercial users of electronic equipment should apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 and the related fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  to the obligation associated with historical waste  since this type of obligation is an asset retirement obligation 
the initial recognition of an asset retirement cost liability shall be recorded as an equal and offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the related asset 
subsequent adjustments to the initial measurement of the asset and liability shall also be made in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
the guidance in this fsp shall be applied the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the date of the adoption of the law by the applicable eu member country 
we are currently evaluating the impact this fsp will have on our consolidated financial statements  if any 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no

which establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
the statement provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable 
the statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements 
sfas no

these staff positions provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the ajca that was signed into law on october  fsp no 
states that the tax relief special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing from this legislation should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction 
the special deduction for domestic manufacturing becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal we believe this legislation and the provisions of fsp no 
will not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
fsp no 
gives a company additional time to evaluate the effects of the legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we formulated a plan to repatriate approximately million of foreign earnings in fiscal  which includes million of extraordinary intercompany dividends under the provisions of the ajca 
this action resulted in an aggregate tax charge of approximately million  which included an incremental tax charge of approximately million in fiscal the overall effective rate for income taxes increased from for fiscal to for fiscal primarily as a result of the repatriation plan
