net revenues for the sands decreased million  from million for the year ended june  to million in the year ended june   a reduction of  as the downtown reno property endured the one out of every three year absence of a major four to five month long bowling tournament 
because of its proximity to the downtown reno national bowling stadium  the sands is the company property most affected by the absence of a major bowling event 
promotional allowances are discounted from gross revenues to arrive at net revenues  and were  or  higher in fiscal than in the prior fiscal year 
this was due to aggressive special promotions  particularly centered around complimentary lodging  as the sands sought to mitigate the effect of a major bowling tournament

revenue from slot machines was the gaming center least impacted by the absence of a major bowling tournament  but slot revenue still declined year over year 
a large component of total slot machine revenue at the sands is generated by patrons from the greater reno area and this segment was supported through direct mail  advertising and special promotions  particularly in the winter months 
table games revenue declined  or  from fiscal  as table games were popular with the men bowlers in the prior year 
part

lodging revenues for the sands decreased from million in the year ended june   to million in fiscal  a reduction of 
the sands average room rate was for fiscal versus for fiscal  which accounted for approximately  of the lodging revenue decline 
however  the primary reason for the lodging revenue decrease was  or  fewer rooms occupied in fiscal than in fiscal food and beverage revenues decreased  less than the sands revenues as a whole  due to the introduction of lucky joker poker  which offered promotional food specials and discounts in the restaurants 
income from operations decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  or  due primarily to the decrease in net revenues 
the expense margin for the sands worsened from to  as revenues decreased and operating expenses declined just 
the lower customer volume levels did not allow for the economies of scale experienced in the prior year 
however  general and administrative expenses did decline  or 
approximately  of the decline was due to a reduction in accrued management bonus as the property failed to achieve its internal operating targets 
an additional  of savings was due to a decrease in legal fees  primarily in connection with its retrac city of reno train trench project litigation

for the year ended june   gold ranch had net revenues of million  compared to million for the year ended june  this increase was attributable to the increase in the retail price of gasoline 
the average retail price of a gallon of gasoline was for fiscal compared to for fiscal gasoline gallons sold declined by  or  as competitive gasoline pricing on the i corridor in california did not permit gold ranch the ability to sell gasoline as cheaply as its california competitors and maintain an acceptable gross margin 
further  new taxes imposed by the nevada legislature which became effective in included tax hikes for tobacco and alcohol 
for tobacco products in particular  nevada had enjoyed a competitive advantage over california with respect to excise taxes 
this advantage closed substantially with the new nevada taxes and tobacco sales dropped by  or  in the year over year comparison 
gaming revenue for gold ranch is comprised of slot machine revenue and  to a lesser degree  revenue from a california lottery ticket station 
gaming revenue decreased from million for the year ended june  to million in the year ended june   a decrease of 
management believes the decrease was due in part to the decrease in the number of customers drawn by comparatively inexpensive gasoline and tobacco products 
in february  an  slot marketing and ticketing system was installed 
management believes this capital investment is strategically important to transform gold ranch from a fuel and convenience store with gaming to a casino with amenities  which attract locals and travelers alike 
gold ranch s income from operations declined from million in the year ended june  to million  or  in the year ended june  the principal reason for the decline was the revenue shortfall 
additionally  taxes and license fees increased as gold ranch and much of verdi  nevada was incorporated into the city of reno on december  the anticipated annual impact of this change will be approximately  annually 
gold ranch management supported the annexation by the city of reno because of what municipal water and sewer  projected within the next few years  could mean for the growth of gold ranch and the surrounding area

corporate costs were redefined at the beginning of the current fiscal year and now include the salaries and benefits of corporate officers  directors  and other corporate level management  in addition to public company reporting costs  and public company related legal and accounting fees 
reclassifications of costs have been made to the prior year for comparison purposes 
corporate operating costs were million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june  the increases in corporate costs were primarily the result of  of costs directly attributable to fees to outside professionals retained to assist in compliance with the new internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of sox  specifically sox section the company has determined itself to be a non accelerated filer  and as such is subject to new rules  which provide that the date we need to be fully sox compliant be extended to june  the company has taken the opportunity to scale back the resources projected to be needed from outside consultants and anticipates more compliance work to be performed in house 
the full amount which will need to be appropriated on sox to attain compliance is not specifically known  but future costs are anticipated to be material 
interest expense

the sands benefited from an unusually strong winter and early spring  which is typically a very slow season 
gold ranch had net operating revenues of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
this increase resulted from higher gasoline prices at the high volume fuel and convenience store 
rail city s net revenues were million for two months of operations 
our consolidated income from operations was million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june  income from operations for the sands was just under million in fiscal as compared to over million in fiscal the sands had a net operating revenue increase  but slightly lower income from operations due mainly to increased marketing expense designed to counter the effects of the retrac project and the new thunder valley casino in nearby rocklin  california 
gold ranch s income from operations decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  lower primarily due to a  charge for impairment of its gasoline pumps 
rail city had income from operations of million in its first two months of operations under the company 
finally  corporate costs of the parent company amounted to  larger than the  operating expenses of the prior year  due to an allocation of corporate salaries and bonus expense precipitated by the purchase of rail city 
consolidated net income was million  or per share diluted for the year ended june  compared to million  or 
per share 
diluted for the year ended june  the large improvement in fiscal net income was due primarily to two events 
first  the company received payments of million on a previously fully reserved note receivable the company possessed in connection with its december sale of the copa casino see gain on previously reserved note receivable in this discussion  and secondly  rail city contributed  to net income in its first two months of operations

the sands net revenues increased  from million for fiscal to million in fiscal  as the downtown reno property benefited from the men s american bowlers congress triennial tournament  which was a month longer and drew larger numbers to the reno area than last year s women s invitational bowlers congress triennial tournament 
further  former patrons 
table of contents of the closed sundowner casino  situated adjacent to the sands  provided the sands with incremental guest counts 
factors moderating the downtown reno property s revenues included the intermittent street disruptions caused by ongoing work on the downtown railroad trench retrac project  high fuel prices  and increased competition from native american casinos  especially from the nearby thunder valley casino in rocklin  california  which opened in may gaming revenues for the sands increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gaming revenues for fiscal tracked lower to the prior year through approximately november  primarily attributable to a soft fiscal first quarter  which was weakened by i street closures from the retrac project and ii less patronage from by the northern california feeder market who gave trial to the newly opened thunder valley casino 
in the march quarter  which was unusually strong in what is typically a seasonally slow period  the gaming revenues turned higher on the year over year comparison and remained higher  finishing higher than the prior year by  or 
the increase in gaming revenues was partially offset by lost revenues from our keno operations  which was outsourced to a third party on may   and now realizes only a small percentage of total keno revenues  but also experiences reduced costs 
lodging revenues for the sands increased for the year ended june   to million from million for fiscal the sands average room rate was for fiscal versus for fiscal  which contributed approximately  to the increase in lodging revenues 
however  the primary reason for the lodging revenue increase was an additional  or  more rooms sold in the fiscal year than in fiscal the sands benefited from less rooms available in the market  as two downtown hotels  the comstock and the sundowner  were closed most of the year  both currently being remodeled into condominiums 
despite an increase in net revenues at the sands  income from operations decreased  or  from fiscal to fiscal  due to a variety of factors  including increased marketing costs to combat the negative effects of both the retrac project and the new competition from california casinos 
further  the wholesale prices for meat used in the restaurants was markedly higher  the nevada legislature enacted new taxes which increased operating costs over  and finally  depreciation costs were higher due to the first full year of amortization of two large projects completed in fiscal i the hotel guest rooms remodel and ii the slot machine player tracking system upgrade

for the year ended june   gold ranch had net revenues of million  compared to million for the year ended june  this increase was attributable primarily to gasoline revenue and in particular an increase in the price of gasoline 
the average retail price of a gallon of gasoline was for fiscal compared to for fiscal gasoline gallons sold declined by  or  due in part to slightly less traffic on interstate during the fiscal year 
additionally  during the last half of the fiscal year  gold ranch experienced some competitive gasoline pricing on the i corridor in california 
at times  gold ranch wasn t able to sell gasoline as cheaply as its california competitors and maintain its margins 
gaming revenue for gold ranch is comprised of slot machine revenue and  to a lesser degree  revenue from a california lottery ticket station 
gaming revenue increased from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  management believes the substantially flat results were due  in part  to the decrease in the number of customers drawn by inexpensive gasoline and to competition from casinos in northern california 
further  gaming revenues were negatively impacted by a lower than theoretical hold percentage on its slot machines 
hold percentage is the percentage the house wins  which is compared to total dollars played 
management believes the excessively low hold problem of its slot machines was isolated in nature and has taken corrective action 
gold ranch s income from operations for the year ended june  declined from the year ended june  by  or 
the primary reason for the decline was a non cash charge of  taken on its gasoline pumps 
further  management believes that the intermittently malfunctioning pumps may have contributed to the gallons sold shortfall 
other items contributing to gold ranch s decrease in income from operations include higher meat prices in its restaurant  new taxes enacted by the nevada legislature  which became effective mid year and among other things  increased the nevada tax on cigarettes and negatively impacted convenience store volume and gross margins

table of contents corporate costs 
historically  corporate costs of the parent company included primarily public company reporting costs  related legal and accounting fees and directors fees and related expenses 
corporate costs were  in the year ended june   compared to  in the year ended june  as of the beginning of fiscal  in light of recent growth  the company redefined corporate costs to include and the salaries  taxes and benefits of certain executives and management 
reclassifications for comparison purposes were made to segment information retrospectively in fiscal  which increased corporate costs by million  decreased subsidiary general and administrative expenses by the same amount  and did not have an effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense was almost million for the year ended june   compared to slightly more than million in the year ended june  the decrease resulted despite our acceleration of the expensing of loan fees from our previous bank debt  which was refinanced in may we account for the amortization of loan fees within our interest expense and those fees were  greater in than the prior year 
throughout fiscal  the company continued its policy to pay down its long term line of credit with any available cash 
this was accelerated by a million settlement we received on a fully reserved note receivable we held in connection with the december sale of the copa casino 
on may   we increased our bank debt from million to approximately million to fund the rail city acquisition 
gain on previously reserved note receivable 
on november   we reached an agreement with gulfside casino partnership d b a the copa casino in gulfport  mississippi  regarding a final settlement of amounts owed to the company pursuant to a non interest bearing promissory note issued to the company in connection with its december sale of its interest in the copa casino 
the terms of the note required a monthly payment to the company in an amount equal to the greater of  or of the copa casino s gross gaming revenues beginning july until the note was paid in full 
at the time of the settlement  the unpaid balance of the note was million 
on november   the company received an approximately million cash payment as final settlement under the note 
the company had not previously recognized a gain on the settlement amount due primarily to the company s uncertainty of the copa s current management s ability to obtain long term financing  as well as competitive  legal  financial  environmental and various other risks facing the casino 
as a result  in december  the company recognized a gain for the full settlement amount of million plus debt service payments of  made during the period 
federal income tax effective rate 
the company s effective tax rate of varies significantly from the statutory rate due to circumstances involving the company s sale of the copa casino 
at the time of the copa casino s sale  the company s tax basis in the copa casino was million and its financial basis was million 
the sales price included a note for million and  in cash 
the million proceeds from the sale was recognized for tax purposes and a million tax gain was recorded 
no gain was recognized for financial statement purposes at the time of the sale 
a deferred tax asset was recognized for million with a related valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance was recorded due to the uncertainty of receiving any future payments in relation to the sale 
in fiscal  payments were received  which reduced the net deferred tax asset to  in fiscal  a payment of million was received in a negotiated settlement of the note 
in addition  the remaining million due was written off as bad debt for tax purposes  as this was previously recorded as part of the tax gain in accordingly  the valuation allowance was reversed  the deferred tax asset was utilized  and the overall tax rate was reduced as a result of this transaction 
seasonality as is true for most casinos in the reno area  especially for casinos with lodging  tourism declines rather substantially in the winter 
due to lower room rates and a lower level of gaming play per occupied room  operating margins and  to a lesser extent  revenues are lower during our second and third fiscal quarters 
to attempt to counter this seasonality  the company has aggressively pursued local patrons for the last several years 

table of contents additionally  the company acquired locals casinos  rail city in may  and the dayton depot in september  which historically experience no seasonality or even a mildly reverse seasonality  that is  a slightly higher than average demand during the winter months 
despite these acquisitions  management anticipates that the trend of experiencing lower operating margins and revenues in the winter months of each fiscal year may diminish somewhat  but should continue 
capital resources and liquidity at june   our cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease from million as of june  we had negative working capital of million at june  the decrease in cash and the negative working capital is consistent with our policy to use any available cash not immediately needed in operations to pay down our line of credit and minimize interest expense 
at june   we had a loan balance of million and million available under our revolving credit facility 
cash flow from operations provided million during the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due to incremental cash generated by rail city  which had a full twelve months of operations during the period  but only two months of operations during the prior year 
investing activities accounted for a million use of cash for the current fiscal year  compared with million used for investing activities in the prior year 
the large difference is due to the company s acquisition of rail city in may of the prior year 
we generated total gross proceeds of million million  net from the issuance of company stock 
of the total proceeds  million was realized when the company completed a sale of  shares of its common stock to institutional investors in november all cash generated from the issuance of company stock  as well as cash generated from other activities  was used to pay down the company s line of credit 
a total of million of debt was paid down during the year ended june  refer to the consolidated financial statements note  for a more complete description of these transactions 
our bank term loan and revolving credit facility  requires the company to be in compliance with certain financial and other covenants  restricts future encumbrances  and limits situations where a change in control in the company may occur 
the financial covenants include the requirement that a minimum ebitda earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other financial ratios be maintained 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all covenants and restrictions at june  during fiscal  we had capital expenditures of million of which million of which was for new slot machines and slot product 
during the year we began what is anticipated to be a million casino renovation of its sands property 
the casino floor and other common areas are being refurbished 
sands management estimates the project to be approximately complete as of june  additionally at gold ranch  during the most recent fiscal year  we installed a new slot machine ticketing and marketing system  and replaced the gas pumps 
we are also pursuing expansion opportunities at rail city 
pending the successful acquisition of land that is currently leased by rail city and successfully obtaining necessary licenses and permits  we have plans to add capacity to all revenue centers of the facility 
the preliminary estimate for this project is million 
further  the company continues to actively pursue other gaming opportunities in this jurisdiction and others 
on september   the company completed its previously announced plans to purchase the depot casino and red hawk sports bar in dayton  nevada 
the final purchase price is expected to be approximately million  million in cash and approximately  in company stock 
the company has immediate plans to appropriate approximately million for slot equipment and minor remodeling to enhance these casinos competitiveness in the dayton valley carson city area 
effective with the acquisition of the dayton casinos  the company has an amended and restated credit facility consolidated financial statements note 
immediately before the company s acquisition of the

after the acquisition  the debt balance on our amended and restated credit facility increased to million  however  we still have credit lines available of million 
the company believes that its cash funds  cash generated from operations  and available borrowing capacity is sufficient to fund its operations and meet current debt obligations  and fulfill its capital expenditure plans for the next twelve months 
we are subject to financial  economic  competitive  regulatory  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control

our business may be adversely impacted if the reno economy declines 
we heavily market to and rely upon business from reno area residents 
in recent years  reno has enjoyed robust business growth and has attracted a number of technology  product distribution and marketing companies 
these businesses have created jobs and helped fuel residential development  including the reno metropolitan area 
should there be negative changes in the business and job conditions in reno  our locals business  which is a substantial part of our overall business  could be adversely impacted 
the gaming industry is highly competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
the gaming industry is highly competitive 
as competitive pressures from california native american casinos increase  other reno area casinos may intensify their targeting of the reno area resident market  which is one of our key markets 
increased competitive pressures in the local market could adversely impact our ability to continue to attract local residents to our facilities  or require us to use more expensive and therefore less profitable promotions to compete more efficiently 
in addition  native american gaming facilities in california and other jurisdictions in some instances operate under regulatory requirements less stringent than those imposed on nevada licensed casinos  which could afford them a competitive advantage in our markets 
our business may be adversely impacted by expanded native american gaming operations in california and the pacific northwest 
our largest sources of tourist customers are california and the pacific northwest  including a large number who drive to reno from the san francisco and sacramento metropolitan areas 
the expansion of native american casinos in california  oregon  and washington continues to have an impact on casino revenues in nevada in general  and some analysts have predicted the impact will be significant on the reno tahoe market

california s well documented budgetary problems have state officials in active negotiations to renegotiate certain compacts with native american tribes 
some native american casino compacts have already been changed to allow for additional slot machines 
the effect of increased gaming in california and other states is difficult to predict 
however  our business would be adversely impacted if thunder valley and other casinos attract patrons who would otherwise travel to reno 
in addition  a significant portion of our customer base is made up of reno area residents 
if other reno area casinos lose business due to competition from native american casinos  they may intensify their marketing efforts to reno area residents as well  which could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results 
adverse winter weather conditions in the sierra nevada mountains and reno lake tahoe area could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse winter weather conditions  particularly snowfall  can deter our customers from traveling or make it difficult for them to frequent our facilities 
adverse winter weather would most significantly affect our drive in customers from northern california and the pacific northwest 
if the reno area itself were to experience prolonged adverse winter weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected 
terrorist attacks may seriously harm our business 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that created economic and business uncertainties  especially for the travel and tourism industry 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses  and other acts of war or hostility have created economic and political uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition in ways we currently cannot predict 
if we lose our key personnel  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on the continued performance of our chief executive officer and his management team 
if we lose the services of our senior management personnel  and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us 
the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
the state of nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses  registrations  permits and approvals to be held by us 
the nevada gaming commission may  among other things  limit  condition  suspend  or revoke or decline to renew a license for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority 
if we violate gaming laws or regulations  substantial fines could be levied against us and we could be forced to forfeit a portion of our assets 
the suspension  revocation or non renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets would have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the state of nevada or local municipalities increase gaming taxes and fees  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
from time to time  legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
in addition  worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
if the state of nevada  the 
table of contents cities of reno or sparks  or the county of washoe were to increase gaming taxes and fees  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
recently issued standards  rules and regulations of governing agencies and bodies could result in material increases in our corporate expense which could adversely affect our financial results 
we keep abreast of new generally acceptable accounting principles and rules and regulations issued or adopted by the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  the nasdaq and other standard setting agencies 
these principles  rules and regulations often require us to expend funds in order to meet additional requirements 
as a result  our expenses could materially increase  which could adversely affect our financial results 
recently issued accounting standards affecting our financial results are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our substantial indebtedness after recent acquisitions could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
with our recent amended and restated credit agreement and the company s recent acquisitions  we now have a bank credit facility  which  fully extended  amounts to million 
we expect to incur additional indebtedness as a result of our planned casino acquisitions and other projects  which could result in overall indebtedness of the company to increase to million  or beyond  in the next months 
the increased levels of debt could  among other things require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends  acquisitions and other purposes  increase our vulnerability to  and limit flexibility in planning for  adverse economic and industry conditions  create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels  and limit our ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the repayment of debt 
we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of our recent and future acquisitions and or experience significant charges to earnings as a result of the acquisition that may adversely affect our stock price and financial condition 
the future success of the company s acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the successful integration of the newly acquired operations with existing operations 
potential difficulties of combining the operations of acquirees with that of the company include  among others retaining key employees  consolidating administrative infrastructures  coordinating sales and marketing functions  and minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns 
even if the company is able to integrate its acquisitions successfully  this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits and growth opportunities that we expect or these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame 
in addition  as a result of the recent acquisitions we have experienced  and will likely continue to experience  significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses that may include transaction costs or 
table of contents closure costs 
these costs may include substantial fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and financial printing costs 
charges that we may incur in connection with acquisition could adversely affect our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk with the amended and restated credit agreement executed in september  in conjunction the with the acquisition of the depot in dayton  the company has substantial variable interest rate debt 
assuming the credit facilities are fully advanced  a one percent increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  annually 
additionally  terms of the company s rv park management agreement with prospector gaming enterprises pge  referenced as in the commitments and contingencies section of this report  state that the company pay monthly an amount equal to of pge s debt service on the underlying rv park note  which varies directly with changes in the prime index 
the financial impact to the company of a full one percent increase in the prime index is less than  per year 
the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
