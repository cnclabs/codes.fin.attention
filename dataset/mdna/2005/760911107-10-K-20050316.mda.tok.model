the company has entered into a number of license agreements covering potential products using the company s spd technology 
the company receives fees and minimum annual royalties under certain license agreements and records fee income on a ratable basis each quarter

the company has historically used the black scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of each option grant 
the black scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives  and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but these items involve uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years
