item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we are a mixed model provider of primary care physician services 
through our network of medical centers and ipas located in miami dade  broward and hillsborough counties  florida  we were responsible for providing primary care medical services or overseeing the provision of primary care services by affiliated physicians to approximately  patients on a full risk basis and approximately  patients on a limited or non risk basis as of june  in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated by providing services to medicare eligible members under full risk agreements that require us to assume responsibility to provide and pay for all of our patients medical needs in exchange for a capitated fee  typically a percentage of the premium received by an hmo from various payor sources 
in an effort to streamline and stem operating losses  effective january   we terminated the medicare and medicaid lines of business for all of the physician contracts associated with one of our ipas  which consisted of physicians at the time of termination 
additionally  in december  we implemented a plan to dispose of our home health operations 
the home health disposition occurred in three separate transactions and was concluded on february  as a result of these transactions  the operations of the terminated ipas and our home health operations are shown as discontinued operations 
restatement our consolidated financial statements as of and for fiscal have been restated to give effect to the financial impact of a latent error in an automated software system used to submit particular patient data to one of our hmo affiliates 
because the data submitted through the software in question formed an element of the hmo s calculation of payments due to us  the error resulted in us over stating revenue associated with that one hmo beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal the software s use was confined to the one hmo 
accordingly  the error did not impact revenue associated with any of our other hmo affiliates and had no effect on our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended june  the restatement reduced previously reported revenue and net income for fiscal by approximately million  or per basic and diluted common share 
the restatement also reduced the amount previously reported as due from hmos at june  by approximately million 
the following discussion has been updated to give effect to this restatement 
medicare considerations substantially all of our net medical services revenue from continuing operations is based upon medicare funded programs 
the federal government and state governments  including florida s  from time to time explores ways to reduce medical care costs through medicare reform and through health care reform generally 
any changes that would limit  reduce or delay receipt of medicare funding or that would increase the benefits we are required to provide to medicare patients without a corresponding increase in the amounts we are paid for our services or any developments that would disqualify us from receiving medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  prospects  financial results  financial condition or cash flows 
due to the diverse range of proposals put forth and the uncertainty of any proposal s adoption  we cannot predict what impact any medicare reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on our business  financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of the amounts recorded on our financial statements could change materially under different  yet still reasonable  estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience  knowledge of current events and expectations of future events  and we continuously evaluate and update our estimates and assumptions 
however  our estimates and assumptions may ultimately prove to be incorrect or incomplete and  as a result  our actual results may differ materially from those previously reported 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition under our full risk contracts with hmos  we receive a percentage of premium or other capitated fee for each patient that chooses one of our physicians as their primary care physician 
revenue under these agreements is generally recorded in the period services are rendered at the rates then in effect as determined by the respective contract 
as part of the medicare advantage program  cms periodically recomputes the premiums to be paid to the hmos based on updated health status of participants and updated demographic factors 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time that the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is received from the hmo or cms 
under our full risk agreements  we assume responsibility for the cost of all medical services provided to the patient  even those we do not provide directly  in exchange for a percentage of premium or other capitated fee 
to the extent that patients require more frequent or expensive care  our revenue under a contract may be insufficient to cover the costs of care provided 
when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a contract or group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated capitated revenue on those contracts  we recognize losses on our prepaid health care services with hmos 
no contracts were considered loss contracts at june  because we have the right to terminate unprofitable physicians and close unprofitable centers under our managed care contracts 
under our limited risk and no risk contracts with hmos  we receive a management fee based on the number of patients for which we are providing services on a monthly basis 
the management fee is recorded as revenue in the period in which services are provided as determined by the respective contract 
medical claims expense recognition the cost of health care services provided or contracted for is accrued in the period in which the services are provided 
this cost includes our estimate of the related liability for medical claims incurred in the period but not yet reported  or ibnr 
ibnr represents a material portion of our medical claims liability which is presented in the balance sheet net of amounts due from hmos 
changes in this estimate can materially affect  either favorably or unfavorably  our results from operations and overall financial position 
we develop our estimate of ibnr primarily based on historical claims incurred per member per month 
we adjust our estimate if we have unusually high or low inpatient utilization or if benefit changes provided under the hmo plans are expected to significantly increase or reduce our claims exposure 
we also adjust our estimate for differences between the estimated claims expense recorded in prior months to actual claims expense as claims are paid by the hmo and reported to us 
to further corroborate our estimate of medical claims  an independent actuarial calculation is performed for us on a quarterly basis 
this independent actuarial calculation indicates that ibnr as of june  was between approximately million and million 
based on our internal analysis and the independent actuarial calculation  as of june   we recorded a liability of approximately million for ibnr 
consideration of impairment related to goodwill and other intangible assets our balance sheet includes intangible assets  including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets  which represented approximately of our total assets at june  under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives to their estimated residual values and also reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise 
indicators of a permanent impairment include  among other things  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate  the loss of a key hmo contract  an adverse action by a regulator  unanticipated competition  the loss of key personnel or allocation of goodwill to a portion of business that is to be sold 
because we operate in a single segment of business  we have determined that we have a single reporting unit and we perform our impairment test for goodwill on an enterprise level 
in performing the impairment test  we compare the total current market value of all of our outstanding common stock  to the current carrying value of our total net assets  including goodwill and intangible assets 
depending on the market value of our common stock at the time that an impairment test is required  there is a risk that a portion of our intangible assets would be considered impaired and must be written off during that period 
we completed our annual impairment test on may   and determined that no indicators of impairment existed 
accordingly  no impairment charges were required at june 
table of contents  should we later determine that an indicator of impairment exists  we would be required to perform an additional impairment test 
realization of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards 
we evaluate the realizability of these deferred tax assets by assessing their valuation allowances and by adjusting the amount of such allowances  if necessary 
among the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our projections of future taxable income streams  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the impact of tax planning strategies that could be implemented to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
however  changes in tax codes  statutory tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of tax accruals and assets and could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
at june   we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
during fiscal  we determined that it is more likely than not that those assets will be realized although realization is not assured  resulting in no valuation allowance at june  results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  selected operating data as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended june  revenue medical services revenue  net management fee revenue and other income total revenue operating expenses medical services medical claims other direct costs total medical services administrative payroll and employee benefits general and administrative gain on extinguishment of debt total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense medicare settlement related to terminated operations income from continuing operations before income tax benefit income tax benefit income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations home health operations terminated ipas total loss from discontinued operations net income 
table of contents comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  revenue from continuing operations medical services revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in our medical services revenue was primarily the result of increases in our medicare revenue  partially offset by a decrease in commercial revenue of approximately million which resulted primarily from the conversion of certain commercial members of an hmo from a risk arrangement to a non risk arrangement during fiscal the most significant component of our medical services revenue is the revenue we generate from medicare patients under full risk arrangements 
during fiscal  revenue generated by our medicare full risk arrangements increased approximately on a per patient per month basis as compared to fiscal  but this increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately in medicare patient months from fiscal the increase in medicare revenue was primarily due to higher per patient per month premiums resulting from the medicare modernization act and the increased phase in of the medicare risk adjustment program  both of which became effective in january our fiscal medical services revenue also included an additional million of medicare advantage funding that we received from an hmo in december and medicare risk adjustments of approximately million that we earned during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal that we expect to collect in the quarter ended december  under the medicare risk adjustment program  the health status of medicare advantage participants is taken into account in determining premiums paid for each participant rather than considering only demographic factors  as was historically the case 
cms periodically recomputes the premiums to be paid to the hmos based on updated health status of participants and updated demographic factors 
future medicare risk adjustments may result in reductions of revenue depending on the future health status and demographic factors of our patients 
management fee revenue and other income of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  related primarily to revenue generated under our limited risk and non risk contracts under the humana pgp agreement 
revenue from continuing operations generated by our managed care entities under contracts with humana accounted for approximately and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from continuing operations generated by our managed care entities under contracts with vista accounted for and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
expenses from continuing operations medical services expenses are comprised of medical claims expense and other direct costs related to the provision of medical services to our patients 
because our full risk contracts with hmos provide that we are financially responsible for all medical services provided to our patients under those contracts  our medical claims expense includes the costs of medical services provided to patients under our full risk contracts by providers other than us 
other direct costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of our health professionals providing primary care services  medical malpractice insurance costs  capitation payments to our ipa physicians and other costs related to the provision of medical services to our patients 
medical services expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal however  as a percentage of total revenue  medical services expenses decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal medical claims expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily as a result of higher medical costs and an increase in utilization of health care services by our medicare patients  partially offset by a decrease in claims expense of approximately million which resulted from the conversion of certain commercial members of an hmo from a risk arrangement to a non risk arrangement during fiscal as a result of these developments  during fiscal our medical claims expense related to our medicare patients increased on a per patient per month basis by approximately 
notwithstanding the increase in the amount of our medical services expenses and claims expense during fiscal  the increase in our medical services revenue more than offset the increase in our medical services expenses and claims expense 
as a result  our claims loss ratio medical claims expense as a percentage of medical services revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal however  in response to the medicare modernization act  certain benefits offered to medicare patients were enhanced by the hmos 
we anticipate that these benefit changes will result in an increase in our medical claims expense and may result in an increase in our claims loss ratio in future periods 
we cannot quantify what impact  if any  these developments may have on our claims loss ratio which fluctuates from period to period or results of operations in future periods 
other direct costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  other direct costs decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in the 
table of contents amount of other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in payroll expense and related benefits for physicians and medical support personnel at our medical centers and an increase in incentive plan accruals 
administrative payroll and employee benefits expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  administrative payroll and employee benefits expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in administrative payroll and employee benefits expense was due to an increase in salaries related to the hiring of additional marketing and executive personnel and an increase in incentive plan accruals 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional fees and the settlement of two lawsuits during fiscal which reduced our accrual for legal claims by million during that fiscal year 
the million and million gain on extinguishment of debt recognized during fiscal and  respectively  related to the million contract modification note with humana that was cancelled in april simultaneously with the note cancellation  we executed the humana pgp agreement 
the humana pgp agreement contained a provision for liquidated damages in the amount of million  which could be asserted by humana under certain circumstances 
to the extent that humana reduced the maximum amount of liquidated damages  we recognized gains from extinguishment of debt in a corresponding amount 
in fiscal and fiscal  humana notified us that the maximum amount of liquidated damages had been reduced from million to and from million to million  respectively 
accordingly  we recognized million and million of the deferred gain on extinguishment of debt in fiscal and  respectively 
income from operations income from operations for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal income from operations for fiscal increased to of total revenue as compared to of total revenue for fiscal medicare settlement related to terminated operations during fiscal  we recorded other income of million relating to the settlement of an alleged medicare obligation 
the alleged obligation related to rehabilitation clinics that were previously operated by one of our former subsidiaries and were sold in cms had alleged that medicare overpayments were made relating to services rendered by these clinics and other related clinics during a period in which the clinics were operated by entities other than us 
we requested that cms reconsider the alleged liability  and in october we were notified that the liability had been reduced from the originally asserted amount of million to million 
loss from discontinued operations home health operations our home health operations contributed million in revenue and generated an operating loss of million which included charges in connection with the disposition of million during fiscal income from discontinued operations terminated ipas the terminated ipas did not contribute any revenue but generated operating income of  during fiscal income generated by the terminated ipas during fiscal resulted from a settlement with the hmo which eliminated all amounts due to and amounts due from the hmo incurred prior to the termination of the contracts on january  taxes we periodically perform an analysis of the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of current and expected operating results 
as of june   we determined that no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was necessary and we decreased our valuation allowance by million for fiscal this decision had the effect of increasing our fiscal net income by approximately million 
since this decision eliminated our entire valuation allowance  it represents a one time gain that will not contribute to our earnings in future periods 
no provision for income taxes was recorded in fiscal due primarily to the utilization of prior year net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result of our utilization of deferred tax assets during fiscal  we reduced the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets by million as of june  to offset income tax liabilities that were generated from current operations 

table of contents net income net income for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  revenue from continuing operations medical services revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in our medicare revenue resulting from the medicare modernization act and the increased phase in of the medicare risk adjustment program  both of which became effective in january during fiscal revenue generated by our medicare full risk contracts increased approximately on a per patient per month basis which was partially offset by a decrease of approximately in medicare patients months 
management fee revenue of million during fiscal related to revenue generated under our limited risk and non risk contracts under the humana pgp agreement 
we executed the humana pgp agreement in april and did not record any revenue under it during fiscal revenue from continuing operations generated by our managed care entities under contracts with humana accounted for and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from continuing operations generated by our managed care entities under contracts with vista accounted for and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
expenses from continuing operations medical services expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal however  as a percentage of total revenue  medical services expenses decreased to for fiscal as compared to of total revenue for fiscal medical claims expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily as a result of higher stop loss insurance costs and an increase in utilization of health care services during notwithstanding the increase in our medical services expenses and claims during fiscal  the increase in medical services revenue more than offset the increase in our medical services expenses and claims expenses 
as a result  our claims loss ratio decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal other direct costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  other direct costs increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in payroll expense for physicians and medical support personnel at our medical centers and an increase in medical malpractice insurance costs 
administrative payroll and employee benefits for fiscal and remained relatively constant at million and million  respectively  or of total revenue for each year 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the settlement of two lawsuits in fiscal as discussed above  which was partially offset by separation costs of million incurred in fiscal in connection with the resignation of our former president 
the million gain on extinguishment of debt recognized during fiscal related to the million contract modification note with humana that was cancelled in april in may  humana notified us that the maximum amount of liquidated damages under the humana pgp agreement had been reduced to million 
accordingly  we recognized million of the deferred gain on extinguishment of debt during fiscal no similar transaction occurred during fiscal income from operations income from operations for fiscal increased by million to million  or of total revenue  from million  or of total revenue  for fiscal 
table of contents medicare settlement related to terminated operations during fiscal  we recorded other income of million relating to the settlement of the alleged medicare obligation discussed above 
loss from discontinued operations home health operations our home health operations contributed million and million in revenue and generated operating losses of million which included charges in connection with the disposition of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations terminated ipas the ipas we terminated effective january  contributed million in medical services revenue and generated operating income of  during fiscal the terminated ipas did not contribute any revenue but generated operating income of  during fiscal income generated by the terminated ipas during fiscal resulted from a settlement with the hmo which eliminated all amounts due to and amounts due from the hmo incurred prior to the termination of the contracts on january  taxes no provision for income taxes was recorded in fiscal and due primarily to the utilization of prior year net operating loss carryforwards 
we periodically perform an analysis of the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of current and expected operating results 
as a result of our utilization of deferred tax assets during fiscal  we reduced the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets by million as of june  the valuation allowance reduction was due to the utilization of deferred tax assets during fiscal to offset income tax liabilities that were generated from current operations 
net income net income for fiscal increased by million to million from million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   working capital was million  an increase of million from a working capital deficit of million at june  the increase in working capital for fiscal was primarily due to income from continuing operations before income tax benefit of million 
cash and cash equivalents were million at june  compared to million at june  net cash of million was provided by operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of million in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in income from operations of million  an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million  and a decrease in the medicare settlement related to terminated operations of million recognized in fiscal  which were partially offset by an increase in extinguishment of debt of million 
the decrease of million in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in amounts due from hmos  a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million  income recognized of million in connection with the medicare settlement related to terminated operations  and a gain of million on the early extinguishment of debt  which taken together  more than offset our million increase in income from continuing operations 
net cash of million was used for investing activities from continuing operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of million in cash used for investing activities from continuing operations during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of equipment of million and the purchase of a million certificate of deposit 
the million certificate of deposit is pledged as collateral in support of a million irrevocable standby letter of credit we are required to maintain for the benefit of one of our hmo affiliates 
the letter of credit will be maintained throughout the term of the managed care agreement with that hmo and can be drawn upon by the hmo if we are delinquent in making payments due to the hmo 
net cash of million was used in financing activities from continuing operations in fiscal compared to net cash used 
table of contents of million in fiscal the increase of million in cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in fiscal was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock of million which was partially offset by an increase in proceeds of million from the promissory note payable to humana discussed below 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in proceeds of million from the issuance of stock and million from the exercise of stock options that were partially offset by an increase of million in repayments to medicare and an increase of million in payments of our million credit facility 
on april   we called our convertible subordinated notes payable for redemption in accordance with their terms  subject to the noteholders right to convert their notes prior to the redemption date into shares of our common stock 
the outstanding principal balance of the notes as of march  was approximately million 
on may  all noteholders converted their notes in accordance with these terms and received  shares of common stock  representing the conversion and cancellation of the entire outstanding principal balance of the notes and the unpaid accrued interest through the conversion date 
on april   we sold  shares of our common stock for million to twelve accredited investors in a private transaction 
the proceeds were used to retire approximately million of long term debt bearing interest at rates ranging from to  to reduce the balance outstanding under our credit facility by approximately million and for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the transaction  an entity controlled by dr 
frost  a member of our board of directors and our principal shareholder  converted a convertible promissory note having an outstanding principal balance and unpaid accrued interest of approximately million into  shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of that note 
on december   we received cash of  from humana in exchange for an unsecured  non interest bearing promissory note for an equal amount 
the promissory note is payable in monthly installments of  through december   but we can prepay the promissory note in full or in part at any time without penalty or premium 
as of june   we had made principal payments amounting to  reducing the outstanding balance on the promissory note to  amounts due under the promissory note are subject to acceleration upon the happening of customary events of default  including the failure to make payments of principal 
effective march   we obtained an extension of the maturity date for our credit facility until march  the terms and conditions of the credit facility remain substantially unchanged after the extension of the maturity date  except that the terms of the credit facility now require us to maintain a minimum cash and cash equivalent balance of million 
as a result of the extension of the maturity date of the credit facility  dr 
frost is now no longer required to personally guarantee our obligations under the credit facility 
at june   we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
in may  our board of directors increased our previously announced program to repurchase shares of our common stock to a total of  shares 
any such repurchases will be made from time to time at the discretion of our management in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions and other factors 
we anticipate that any such repurchases of shares will be funded through cash from operations 
as of september   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately  we believe that we will be able to fund our capital commitments  our anticipated operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future and satisfy any remaining obligations from our working capital  anticipated cash flows from operations  and our credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of june   and have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities or commodity contracts 

table of contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of our long term debt  capital lease obligations  and contractual obligations as of june  payment due by period total less than year years years long term debt obligations related party notes payable  including capitalized interest capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the payments shown above for our related party notes payable include interest that was capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the payments shown above for capital lease obligations and operating lease obligations reflect all payments due under the terms of the respective leases 
see note to our consolidated financial statements to reconcile the payments shown above to the capital lease obligation recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
other factors that could affect our liquidity and cash flow are discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   we had only certificates of deposit and cash equivalents invested in high grade  short term securities  which are not typically subject to material market risk 
we have loans outstanding at fixed rates 
for loans with fixed interest rates  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments and would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of these instruments 
our credit facility is interest rate sensitive  however  we had no amount outstanding under this facility at june  we have no risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices
