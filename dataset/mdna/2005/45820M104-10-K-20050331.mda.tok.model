changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
for purpose of management s discussion and analysis  volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income on a full tax equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets

we increase our allowance for loan losses by provisions charged to operations and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off  and we reduce our allowance by loans charged off 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the allowance 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  we consider the growth  composition and diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  adverse developments that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors deriving from our history of operations 
we follow a loan review process designed to evaluate the credit risk in our loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  we maintain an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as substandard  doubtful or loss and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
testing by our internal auditors and by other independent third parties performing reviews of our loans helps to validate this process 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to make adjustments based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
management continued this extensive review process throughout the fourth quarter of  while its banks were concurrently being examined by the fdic 
management s evaluation is ongoing 
the significant increases in the provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses resulted from management s continuing evaluation of several significant loan relationships for which additional evaluation was deemed necessary 
management continued its intensive and extensive review of these and other loans  which review included assistance from two independent loan review parties  in order to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and specific allocations made for each of these loans 
the provision for loan losses increased million or from million in to million in our allowance for loan losses increased from million at december  to million at december  the allowance for loan losses expressed as a percentage of total loans increased from at december  to at december  this increase in our provision for loan losses and the corresponding increase in our allowance for loan losses expressed as a percentage of total loans resulted directly from the evaluation of loans discussed in the preceding paragraph 
specifically  due to matters which came to the attention of the company s present management during the third quarter of regarding loan relationships at one of the company s subsidiary banks  management greatly expanded the number of loans that were evaluated for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
these extensive evaluations were augmented by third party reviews and validated during the first quarter of by the fdic 
this extensive evaluation process resulted in significantly more loans being evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas as of december  than was the case at december  management also determined that due to the specific facts and circumstances identified during these impairment evaluations  that the resulting increases in the allowance for loan losses were properly recorded in as of december   management has concluded that the allowances for loan losses for both of the company s subsidiary banks are adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in these loan portfolios 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the company s allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses increased million or  while the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses declined thousand or

impaired loans at december  included thousand of loans that were restructured during the year 
as of year end  the status of these loans was current  but management shall continue to classify these loans as impaired until the borrower demonstrates that such classification is no longer necessary 
additionally  while not classified as impaired loans  there were other loans past due days or more  and still accruing interest at december  the total of such loans was thousand  a decrease of million or from the prior year

during  compensation and employee benefits expense increased thousand or from million for to million for equipment expense increased thousand or from million in to million in  reflecting amortization of data processing systems and branch equipment expense acquired in and earlier

these factors resulted in a much larger percentage of our income before income taxes which was comprised of tax exempt income  which in turn  resulted in the aforementioned decrease in our effective tax rate for in comparison to results of operations for the years ended december  and net income the company earned net income of million or per share for as compared with net income of million or per share in  an increase of thousand or in net income 
although our earnings increased  our earnings per share decreased due to the increase in the number of shares of the company s common stock outstanding during  which resulted from the additional shares issued in the business combination consummated on december  net interest income net interest income increased million or to million for compared to the million earned in this increase resulted primarily from the significant increase in the level of our average interest earning assets during the year 
this increase in our average earning assets  combined with a decrease in the average rates we paid for our interest bearing liabilities of basis points  offset the factors that negatively affected our net interest income in these negative factors were a decrease of basis points in the average rate we realized for our earning assets and an increase in the level of our average interest bearing liabilities during the year 
the aforementioned increases in the level of our average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities resulted in large part from the assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination that was completed on december  the average yield on our interest earning assets decreased basis points to while the average rate we paid for our interest bearing liabilities decreased only basis points 
therefore our interest spread dropped from to and our net yield on interest earning assets decreased from to 
the average balance and net interest income analysis table illustrates the changes 
provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased thousand or from million in to million in this decrease in our provision resulted principally from the company s charge off experience during the year 
net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding decreased from in to in despite the significant increase in the level of our average outstanding loans in resulting from the december  business combination and from organic growth during  the increase in our net loan charge offs was not significant 
net loan charge offs increased to thousand during  as compared to thousand in  an increase of only thousand 
our allowance for loan losses increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of thousand 
although the amount of the allowance increased  the allowance as expressed as a percentage of gross loans decreased from at december  to at december  this modest decrease in the level of our allowance as a percentage of gross loans resulted from prior executive management s determination of the overall quality of the loan portfolio at december  non accrual loans decreased from million  or of gross loans at december  to million  or at december  impaired loans at december  included million of loans that were restructured during the year 
as of year end  the status of these loans was current  but management classified these loans as impaired 
there were other loans past due days or more and still accruing interest at december  the total of such loans was million  an increase of million from the balance of such loans at december  non interest income non interest income increased thousand or from million in to million in the increase in service charges on deposit accounts of thousand or to million was the primary factor contributing to the increase in the overall level of our non interest income in the increased number of deposit accounts in  which resulted principally from the merger with community bancshares  inc on december   was the most significant factor affecting the increase in our service charge income 
this primary component of the increase in our service charges related to fees charged for non sufficient funds  which grew from million for to million for  an increase of thousand or income from factoring operations increased by for  while other non interest income grew by or thousand to million 
bank owned life insurance income increased from thousand in to thousand in as we significantly increased our investment in these insurance products during these increases in our non interest income categories were offset by a decrease of thousand in gain on the sale of investments and from a decrease in our income from mortgage operations

provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes for was and for this decrease resulted largely from the increase in non taxable income in liquidity and capital resources maintaining adequate liquidity while managing interest rate risk is the primary goal of the company s asset and liability management strategy 
liquidity is the ability to fund the needs of the company s borrowers and depositors  pay operating expenses  and meet regulatory liquidity requirements 
maturing investments  loan and mortgage backed security principal repayments  deposit growth and borrowings are presently the main sources of the company s liquidity 
the company s primary uses of liquidity are to fund loans and to make investments 
as of december   liquid assets  consisting of cash and cash equivalents and investment securities were approximately million  which represents of total assets and of total deposits and borrowings 
supplementing this liquidity  the company  through its bank subsidiaries  had million of credit available from the federal home loan bank and available lines of credit from correspondent banks totaling million 
at december   outstanding commitments to extend credit were million and undisbursed line of credit balances totaled million 
management believes that the combined aggregate liquidity position of the company is sufficient to meet the funding requirements of loan demand and deposit maturities and withdrawals in the near term 
certificates of deposit represented of the company s total deposits at december  the company s growth strategy includes efforts focused at increasing the relative volume of transaction deposit accounts 
certificates of deposit of  or more represented of the company s total deposits at year end 
these deposits are generally considered rate sensitive  but management believes many of them are relationship oriented 
while the company will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at maturity  there are other subjective factors that will determine the company s continued retention of those deposits 
banks and bank holding companies  as regulated institutions  must meet required levels of capital 
the fdic  the primary regulator of catawba valley bank and first gaston bank  and the federal reserve  the primary regulator of the company  have adopted minimum capital regulations or guidelines that categorize components and the level of risk associated with various types of assets 
financial institutions are expected to maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risk profile assigned to its assets in accordance with these guidelines 
at december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized both catawba valley bank and first gaston bank as well capitalized 
subsequent to this notice  management has determined that catawba valley bank is adequately capitalized  but is no longer well capitalized 
there are no conditions or events that have occurred to change first gaston bank s capital category from well capitalized

based on that assumption  management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations from normal operations

however  management believes that these commitments represent no more than the normal lending risk that the company commits to its borrowers 
if these commitments are drawn  the company plans to obtain collateral if it is deemed necessary based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
the types of collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory and commercial or residential real estate

this risk of loss can be reflected in diminished current market values and or reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
the structure of our loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant decline in interest rates may adversely impact net market values and net interest income
