item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for a description of limitations inherent in forward looking statements  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page ii 
overview and strategy our primary objective is to increase stockholder value of our common stock through increasing reserves  production  cash flow and earnings 
we have shifted the balance of our investments from properties having high rates of production in early years to properties expected to produce more consistently over a longer term 
we attempt to reduce our financial risks by dedicating a smaller portion of our capital to high risk projects  while reserving the majority of our available capital for exploitation and development drilling opportunities 
obtaining positions in long lived oil and natural gas reserves will be given priority over properties that might provide 
table of contents more cash flow in the early years of production  but which have shorter reserve lives 
we also attempt to further reduce risk by emphasizing acquisition possibilities over high risk exploration projects 
during the latter part of  we reduced our emphasis on high risk exploration efforts and started focusing on established geologic trends where we can utilize the engineering  operational  financial and technical expertise of our entire staff 
although we anticipate participating in exploratory drilling activities in the future  reducing financial  reservoir  drilling and geological risks and diversifying our property portfolio are important criteria in the execution of our business plan 
in summary  our current business plan focuses on projects having less geological risk  emphasizes exploitation and enhancement activities  focuses on acquiring producing properties  and expands the scope of operations by diversifying our exploratory and development efforts  both in and outside of our current areas of operation 
although the direction of our exploration and development activities has shifted from high risk exploratory activities to lower risk development opportunities  we will continue our efforts  as we have in the past  to maintain low general and administrative expenses relative to the size of our overall operations  utilize advanced technologies  serve as operator in appropriate circumstances  and reduce operating costs 
the extent to which we are able to implement and follow through with our business plan will be influenced by the prices we receive for the oil and natural gas we produce  the results of reprocessing and reinterpreting our d seismic data  the results of our drilling activities  the costs of obtaining high quality field services  our ability to find and consummate acquisition opportunities  and our ability to negotiate and enter into work to earn arrangements  joint venture or other similar agreements on terms acceptable to us 
significant changes in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas  or the occurrence of unanticipated events beyond our control may cause us to defer or deviate from our business plan  including the amounts we have budgeted for our activities 

table of contents operating performance our operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas and our production volumes 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that we receive for our oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
natural gas prices we receive are influenced by seasonal demand  weather  hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  availability of pipeline transportation to end users  proximity of our wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructures  and world oil prices 
additional factors influencing our overall operating performance include production expenses  overhead requirements  and costs of capital 
our oil and natural gas exploration  development and acquisition activities require substantial and continuing capital expenditures 
historically  the sources of financing to fund our capital expenditures have included cash flow from operations  sales of our equity securities  bank borrowings  and industry joint ventures 
depletion per boe in was versus in and in the increase per boe in was a result of increased drilling costs and producing property acquisitions 
our oil and natural gas producing activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting method  we capitalize all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and the exploration for and development of oil 
table of contents and natural gas reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these costs include lease acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  costs of drilling productive and non productive wells  and overhead expenses directly related to land and property acquisition and exploration and development activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized unless a disposition involves a material change in reserves  in which case the gain or loss is recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  including estimated future development costs  is provided using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and production  which are converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are not amortized  but are individually assessed for impairment 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and natural gas properties being depleted 
results of operations we changed our business model in from exploration on the gulf coast to acquisition and exploitation of long life assets in the permian basin 
at the beginning of  our reserves were approximately million barrels of oil equivalent with a reserves to production ratio of approximately to through the execution of this business model  our reserves at the end of were approximately million barrels of oil equivalent with a reserves to production ratio of approximately to at the end of  our production was natural gas and oil compared to natural gas and oil at the end of the production stream changed from short life gulf coast natural gas to long life permian basin oil and has increased our lease operating expense primarily due to increased utilities and chemicals associated with the oil properties

critical accounting policies and practices full cost and impairment of assets 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
costs of non producing properties  wells in process of being drilled and significant development projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations  is limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling  based on the present value of estimated future net revenues  net of income tax effects  discounted at  plus the lower of cost of fair market value of our unproved properties 
revenues are measured at unescalated oil and natural gas prices at the end of each quarter  with effect given to our cash 
table of contents flow hedge positions 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down to the extent of the excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
it reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices decline 
if commodity prices deteriorate  it is possible that we could incur an impairment in future periods 
depletion 
provision for depletion of oil and natural gas properties  under the full cost method  is calculated using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves with oil and natural gas production being converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
oil and natural gas properties included million and million for and  respectively  for unproved properties not included in depletion 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and natural gas properties being depleted 
proved reserve estimates 
our discounted present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation  and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
our reserve estimates are prepared by outside consultants 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a full cost ceiling writedown 
at december   the excess of the ceiling over our capitalized costs was approximately million 
in addition to the impact of these estimates of proved reserves on calculation of the ceiling  estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely 
accordingly  the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and  on any particular day at the end of a quarter  can be either substantially higher or lower than prices we actually receive in the long term  which are a barometer for true fair value 

table of contents use of estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  expenses  and some narrative disclosures 
hydrocarbon reserves  future development costs and certain hydrocarbon production expense are the most critical estimates to our consolidated financial statements 
derivatives 
the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
and sfas no 
requiring that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
on january  for the periods prior to january   derivative contracts were not designated as hedges 
accordingly  the unrealized gains or losses were recorded in income 
as of january  we designated costless collars  oil and gas swaps  and interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs 
we continued to record the unrealized loss on put positions outstanding in income during the purpose of our hedges is to provide a measure of stability in our oil and natural gas prices and interest rate payments and to manage exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk under existing sales contracts 
overhead reimbursement joint operations 
as compensation for administration  supervision office services and warehousing cost  an operator may charge drilling and producing overhead costs based upon rates negotiated in the joint operating agreement 
overhead reimbursements charged to working interest owners for properties that we operate are treated as reductions in general and administrative expense for producing overhead 
capital costs were reduced by approximately  and  for and  respectfully 
general and administrative costs were reduced by approximately  and  for drilling and producing overhead reimbursements for and  respectfully 
prior to  overhead was recorded as other income 
the amounts reimbursed to us for were  incentive and retention plan 
parallel will account for the plan under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

parallel has determined that the likelihood of the occurrence of a corporate transaction or change of control  as defined in the plan  is possible  however  the ultimate liability to parallel is not readily determinable because of the inability to predict parallel s stock price on the future date of any corporate transaction or change of control 
therefore  the terms and conditions of the plan will be disclosed in parallel s consolidated financial statements  but no liability will be recorded until such time as a corporate transaction or a change of control occurs

table of contents natural gas revenues  excluding hedges  decreased million or for the year ended compared to natural gas production volumes decreased due to natural production declines in our south texas yegua frio and cook mountain projects 
the decline in natural gas volumes decreased revenue approximately million for average realized wellhead natural gas prices increased or per mcf to per mcf 
the increase in natural gas prices had a positive effect on revenues of approximately million for the period ending losses on oil hedges increased million or for compared to due to the increase in oil prices 
natural gas hedge losses were  in compared to  in although natural gas prices increased in  we had less natural gas volumes hedged for on a boe basis  hedges accounted for a realized loss of per boe in compared to per boe in we have hedged certain oil and natural gas volumes see note to consolidated financial statements to try and mitigate price changes in our oil and natural gas movements and to meet the requirements under our loan facility 
based upon our hedges currently in effect and if prices and volumes are held constant  a increase in oil prices would have the effect of increasing oil revenues in fiscal by million 
using the same parameters  a decrease in oil prices would have an effect of an increase of approximately million for at the end of  in association with our property acquisitions  we hedged additional oil volumes for thru  thereby increasing the average price hedged over this is the reason a decrease in oil prices can have a positive effect on this comparison 
based upon our hedges currently in effect and if prices and volumes are held constant  a increase in gas prices would have the effect of increasing gas revenues in fiscal by million 
using the same parameters  a decrease in gas prices would have an effect of a decrease of approximately  for cost and expenses year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease dollars in thousands lease operating expense production taxes general and administrative general and administrative public reporting total general and administrative depreciation and depletion total lease operating expense increased or  compared to during  of our production was crude oil compared to in the change in our business plan to long life assets which influenced our purchase of assets in the west texas fullerton  carm ann and work to earn agreement at diamond m has shifted our production and reserves away from a natural gas base to a crude oil base 
this shift has increased the lease operating expense due to the mechanical operations and utilities required to produce oil properties compared to

lifting costs were per boe in compared to per boe in on a boe basis 
as we continue to exploit and develop our long life permian basin oil properties fullerton  carm ann and diamond m  we expect that lifting costs will continue around the same level or decline due to increased activity 
the lifting costs are also expected to be reduced by the development of natural gas properties in south texas  barnett shale and new mexico 
production taxes increased or  in  associated with a net wellhead increase in revenues of million 
production taxes in future periods will be a function of product mix  production volumes and product prices 
general and administrative in total increased or million in compared to included in our total general and administrative costs is public reporting cost which increased or  for the increase in public reporting cost was attributable to audit costs associated with the change of auditors at the end of and increased legal costs and costs attributable to the work on our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of or sox 
the sox costs have been a significant portion of the increase in our public reporting costs and we expect sox costs to continue into general and administrative expenses capitalized to the full cost pool were million for compared to  for on a boe basis  general and administrative costs were per boe in compared to per boe in  while public reporting costs were per boe and per boe for the same period 
general and administrative expenses will increase in in association with reporting requirements and operational support of current and new acquisitions 
depreciation and depletion expense increased or  for compared to depletion per boe was for and for this increase is attributable to increased drilling costs and producing property purchases 
depreciation expense increased with the cost of a new accounting and production system in depletion costs are highly correlated with production volumes and capital expenditures 
fiscal year depletion costs will increase with increased production volumes

the ineffective gain or loss may increase or decrease until settlement of these contracts 
interest and other income increased with increased interest income and other non recurring income 
interest expense increased with the increase of debt from approximately million to million in along with an increase of our loan interest rate from to later in other expense increased in associated with legal  accounting and related costs associated with an aborted high yield debt offering 
if interest rates remain at current levels  interest expense will decrease for as a result of applying the million in net proceeds from our february equity offering to the repayment of a portion of our existing bank debt

basic weighted average common shares outstanding increased from million shares in to million shares in diluted weighted average common shares increased from million shares in to million shares in the increase in average common shares is due to the  common shares issued in conjunction with the fullerton acquisition and stock options exercised for capital resources and liquidity our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties  bank borrowings supported by our oil and natural gas reserves and completed equity offerings 
our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors  including the prices we receive for oil and natural gas we produce 
working capital decreased or million as of december  compared with december  current assets exceeded current liabilities by  at december  the working capital decrease was primarily due to the decrease in available cash used for debt reduction and capital requirements  increased accounts payable and the increase in derivative obligations 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities year ended december  in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities cash from operating activities in decreased million over due to natural production declines in our south texas gas properties and increased hedge losses with increased commodity prices 
these movements are partially offset by oil production in our permian basin properties and in commodity prices 
investing and financing activities increased in compared to primarily as a result of additional interests acquired in our fullerton property and the carm ann acquisition in 
table of contents cash provided from operating activities in increased million over largely due to increased operating income from the fullerton acquisition  increased production in the cook mountain gas project and increased sales prices in investing and financing activities decreased in compared to primarily as a result of the fullerton acquisition in these declines were partially offset by proceeds from the first permian asset sale also recorded in we incurred property additions of million for the period ended december   primarily due to our net property acquisitions of million  leasehold acquisition  development  and enhancement activities 
also added to our property basis were asset retirement costs of  for sfas see note 
the property acquisitions  development and enhancement activities were financed by the utilization of cash flows provided by operations and our credit facility 
as of march  the amount available under our universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission for the offer and sale  from time to time  of parallel debt and equity securities totaled approximately million 
based on our projected oil and natural gas revenues and related expenses  available bank borrowings and completed equity offering  we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources to fund normal operations and capital requirements  interest expense and principal reduction payments on bank debt  if required  and preferred stock dividends 
we continually review and consider alternative methods of funding 
bank borrowings on september   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement or the credit agreement with first american bank  ssb  bnp paribas  citibank  fsb and western national bank 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility which means that we can borrow  repay and reborrow funds drawn under the credit facility 
the total amount that we can borrow and have outstanding at any one time is limited to the lesser of million or the borrowing base established by our lenders 
at march  our borrowing base was million 
the principal amount outstanding under the credit facility at december  was million  excluding  reserved for our letters of credit 
the amount of the borrowing base is based primarily upon the estimated value of our oil and gas reserves 
the borrowing base amount is redetermined by the lenders semi annually on or about april and october of each year or at other times required by the lenders or at our request 
if  as a result of the lenders redetermination of the borrowing base  the outstanding principal amount of our loan exceeds the borrowing base  we must either provide additional collateral to the lenders or repay the principal of the note in an amount equal to the excess 
except for the principal payments that may be required because of our outstanding loans being in excess of the borrowing base  interest only is payable monthly 
loans made to us under this credit facility bears interest at first american bank s base rate or the libor rate  at our election 
generally  first american bank s base rate is equal to the sum of a the prime rate published in the wall street journal  and b if the principal amount 
table of contents outstanding is equal to or greater than of the borrowing base established by the lenders  a margin of 
the libor rate is generally equal to the sum of a the rate designated as british bankers association interest settlement rates and offered on one  two  three  six or twelve month interest periods for deposits of million  and b a margin ranging from to  depending upon the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than of the borrowing base established by the lenders  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than of the borrowing base  but less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than  but less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
the interest rate we are required to pay on our borrowings  including the applicable margin  may never be less than 
at december   our interest rate was on million  on million  and on million 
we obtain different interest rates on bank base rates and on each libor tranche 
in the case of base rate loans  interest is payable on the last day of each month 
in the case of libor loans  interest is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 
if the total outstanding borrowings under the credit facility are less than the borrowing base  an unused commitment fee is required to be paid to the lenders 
the amount of the fee is 
of the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the borrowing base 
the fee is payable quarterly 
if the borrowing base is increased  we are required to pay a fee of 
on the amount of any increase in the borrowing base 
parallel  llc  a subsidiary of parallel petroleum corporation  guaranteed payment of the loans 
parallel s obligations to the lenders are secured by substantially all of its oil and gas properties 
all outstanding principal under the revolving credit facility is due and payable on december  the maturity date of our outstanding loans may be accelerated by the lenders upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants and compliance requirements as follows at the end of each quarter  a current ratio as defined in the credit agreement of at least to  for each period as calculated in the credit agreement ending on december  march  june and september  a funded debt ratio as defined in the credit 
table of contents agreement of not more than  and  respectively  for december    and  and at all times  adjusted consolidated net worth as defined in the credit agreement of at least a million  plus b seventy five percent of the net proceeds from any equity securities issued by parallel  plus c fifty percent of consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter  if positive  and zero percent if negative 
as of december   we were in compliance with our bank covenants 
the credit agreement also contains restrictions on all retained earnings and net income for payment of dividends on common stock 
under the credit agreement  parallel and its subsidiaries also entered into a separate commitment letter with the lenders 
under the commitment letter  the lenders made available an additional million under the credit agreement for parallel s completion of the purchase of oil and gas properties from third parties 
if we have borrowing capacity under our credit agreement  we intend to borrow  repay and reborrow under the revolving credit facility from time to time as necessary  subject to borrowing base limitations  to fund interpretation and processing of d seismic survey data  lease acquisitions and drilling activities  acquisitions of producing properties or companies owning producing properties  and  general corporate purposes 
preferred stock at december  we had  shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding 
the preferred stock required us to pay dividends of

table of contents outstanding shares of the preferred stock may vote on any proposal to change any provision of the preferred stock which materially and adversely affects the rights  preferences or privileges of the preferred stock  is senior to the common stock with respect to dividends and on liquidation  dissolution or winding up of parallel  has a liquidation value of per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
commodity price risk management transactions for the year ended december   we used mark to market accounting for all our derivative contracts 
as of january  we designated the costless collars  oil and natural gas swaps and interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas  as amended 
we continued mark to market accounting for our put positions 
the purpose of our hedges is to provide a measure of stability in our oil and natural gas prices and interest rate payments and to manage exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk 
our objective is to lock in a range of oil and natural gas prices and a fixed interest rate for certain notional amounts 
under cash flow hedge accounting  the quarterly change in the fair value of the commodity derivatives is recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss and then transferred to revenue in the period the production is sold 
ineffective portions of cash flow hedges changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price are recognized in other expense as they occur 
while the cash flow hedge contract is open  the ineffective gain or loss many increase or decrease until settlement of the contract 
under cash flow hedge accounting for interest rate  the quarterly change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss 
the gain or loss is transferred  on a contract basis  to interest expense as the interest accrues 
ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in other expense as they occur 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty in its derivative instruments 
however  we periodically assess the creditworthiness of the counterparty to mitigate this credit risk 
certain of our commodity price risk management arrangements have required us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations with respect to our commodity price risk management transactions exceed certain levels 
for additional information about our price risk management transactions  see item a of this annual report on form k  beginning on page future capital requirements our capital expenditure budget for is approximately million and is highly dependent on future oil and natural gas prices and the availability of funding 
these expenditures will be governed by the following factors 
table of contents internally generated cash flows  availability of borrowing under our revolving credit facility  additional sources of funding  and future drilling successes 
in  we have focused on drilling lower risk natural gas prospects that could have a meaningful effect on our reserve base and cash flows 
in selected cases  we may elect to reduce our interest in higher risk  higher impact projects 
we may also sell certain non core producing properties to raise funds for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have contractual obligations and commitments that may affect our financial position 
however  based on our assessment of the provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligation and commitments  we do not feel there would be an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards combined with our plans for development and acquisitions may offset any major cash outflows 
however  the ultimate timing of the settlements cannot be precisely determined 
in addition to our principal payment obligations under the revolving credit facility payment noted in the table above  we are subject to interest payments on such indebtedness 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
outlook the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make  and anticipate that we will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures in the exploration for  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  our capital expenditures have been financed primarily with internally generated cash from operations  proceeds from bank borrowings  and proceeds from sales of equity securities 
the continued availability of these capital sources depends upon a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the volumes of oil and natural gas we produce from existing wells  the prices at which we sell oil and natural gas  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
each of these variables materially affects our borrowing capacity 
we may from time to time seek additional financing in the form of increased bank borrowings  sales of parallel s securities  sales of non core properties  or other forms of financing 

table of contents we do not have agreements for any future financing and there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing 
inflation our drilling costs have escalated and we would expect this trend to continue  but our commodity prices have also increased at the same time

effects of derivative instruments for the year ended december   we used mark to market accounting for all our derivative contracts 
as of january  we designated the costless collars  oil and natural gas swaps and interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas  as amended 
we continued mark to market accounting for our put positions 
the purpose of our hedges is to provide a measure of stability in our oil and natural gas prices and interest rate payments and to manage exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk 
our objective is to lock in a range of oil and natural gas prices and fixed interest rates 
under cash flow hedge accounting  the quarterly change in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss and then transferred to earnings when the production is sold 
ineffective portions of cash flow hedges changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price are recognized in other expense as they occur 
while the cash flow hedge contract is open  the ineffective gain or loss many increase or decrease until settlement of the contract 

table of contents we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty in its derivative instruments 
however  we periodically assess the creditworthiness of the counterparty to mitigate this credit risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about market risks and derivative instruments to which parallel was a party at december   and from which parallel may incur future earnings  gains or losses from changes in market interest rates and oil and natural gas prices 
interest rate sensitivity as of december  our only financial instrument sensitive to changes in interest rates is our bank debt 
as the interest rate is variable and reflects current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value 
the table below shows principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates were determined using weighted average interest paid and accrued in december  you should read note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt that is sensitive to interest rates 
total dollars in thousands variable rate debt revolving facility secured average interest rate at december   we had bank loans in the amount of approximately million outstanding at an average interest rate of 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  at our election  at i the bank s base rate or ii the libor rate  plus libor margin  but in no event less than 
as a result  our annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
as the interest rate is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value 
under our credit facility  we may elect an interest rate based upon the agent lender s base lending rate  or the libor rate  plus a margin ranging from to per annum  depending on our borrowing base usage 
the interest rate we are required to pay  including the applicable margin  may never be less than 

table of contents as of december   we had entered into fixed interest rate swap contracts with bnp paribas based on the day libor rates at the time of the contract 
the effect of the swap is that we converted our variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
we will receive variable interest rates as described previously and pay fixed rates as shown in the table below 
notional period of time amounts fixed interest rates in millions january  thru december  january  thru december  january  thru december  january  thru december  commodity price sensitivity as of december  our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to the region in which we produce natural gas 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
we expect pricing volatility to continue 
oil prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during natural gas prices we received during ranged from a low of per mcf to a high of per mcf 
a significant decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
put options 
on may  we purchased put floors on volumes of  mcf per month for a total of  mcf during the seven month period from april through october at a floor price of per mcf for a total consideration of  these derivatives were not held for trading purposes 
a decrease in fair value of the put floors of approximately  was recognized for the period ended december  in our consolidated statements of operations 
costless collar 
collars are created by purchasing puts to establish a floor price and then selling a call which establishes a maximum amount we will receive for the oil or natural gas hedged 
calls are sold to offset or reduce the premium paid for buying the put 
we have entered into costless houston ship channel gas collars and west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil collars

generally  swaps are an agreement to buy or sell a specified commodity for delivery in the future  but at an agreed fixed price 
swap transactions convert a floating price into a fixed price 
for any particular swap transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to the hedge party if the reference price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for such hedge  and the hedge party is required to make a payment to the counterparty if the reference price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for such hedge
