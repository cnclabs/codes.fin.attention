export items include certain poultry parts that have greater value in some overseas markets than in the us united states product types chicken products prepared foods overview 
during fiscal   million  or  of our us chicken sales were in prepared foods products to foodservice customers and retail distributors  as compared to million in fiscal these numbers reflect the strategic focus for our growth and our fiscal acquisition 
the market for prepared chicken products has experienced  and we believe will continue to experience  greater growth  higher average sales prices and higher margins than fresh chicken products 
also  the production and sale in the us of prepared foods products reduce the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our profitability 
feed ingredient costs are the single largest component of our total us cost of sales  representing approximately of our us cost of sales for the fiscal year ended october  the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories  demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the us and foreign governments 
as further processing is performed  feed ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product s total production cost  thereby reducing their impact on our profitability 
products sold in this form enable us to charge a premium  reduce the impact of feed ingredient costs on our profitability and improve and stabilize our profit margins 
we establish prices for our prepared chicken products based primarily upon perceived value to the customer  production costs and prices of competing products 
the majority of these products are sold pursuant to agreements with varying terms that either set a fixed price for the products or set a price according to formulas based on an underlying commodity market  subject in many cases to minimum and maximum prices 
fresh chicken overview 
our fresh chicken business is an important component of our sales and accounted for  million  or  of our total us chicken sales for fiscal in addition to maintaining sales of mature  traditional fresh chicken products  our strategy is to shift the mix of our us fresh chicken products by continuing to increase sales of higher margin  faster growing products  such as marinated chicken and chicken parts  and to continually shift portions of this product mix into the higher value and margin prepared foods category 
most fresh chicken products are sold to established customers  based upon certain weekly or monthly market prices reported by the usda and other public price reporting services  plus a markup  which is dependent upon the customer s location  volume  product specifications and other factors 
we believe our practices with respect to sales of fresh chicken are generally consistent with those of our competitors 
the majority of these products are sold pursuant to agreements with varying terms that either set a fixed price for the products or set a price according to formulas based on an underlying commodity market  subject in many cases to minimum and maximum prices 
export and other chicken products overview 
our export and other products consist of whole chickens and chicken parts sold primarily in bulk  non branded form  either refrigerated to distributors in the us or frozen for distribution to export markets  and branded and non branded prepared foods products for distribution to export markets 
in fiscal  approximately million  or  of our total us chicken sales were attributable to us chicken export and other products 
these exports and other products  other than the prepared foods products  have historically been characterized by lower prices and greater price volatility than our more value added product lines 
turkey products prepared foods overview 
during fiscal  million  or  of our total u 
s turkey sales were prepared turkey products sold to foodservice customers and retail distributors 
like the us chicken markets  the market for prepared turkey products has experienced greater growth and higher margins than fresh turkey products 
we establish prices for our prepared turkey products based primarily upon perceived value to the customer  production costs and prices of competing products 
the majority of these products are sold pursuant to agreements with varying terms that either set a fixed price or are subject to a market driven formula 
fresh turkey overview 
our fresh turkey business accounted for million  or  of our total us turkey sales in fiscal as is typical for the industry  a significant portion of the sales of fresh and frozen whole turkeys is seasonal in nature  with the height of sales occurring during the thanksgiving and christmas holidays 
in addition to maintaining sales of mature  traditional fresh turkey products  our strategy is to shift the mix of our fresh turkey products by increasing sales of higher margin  faster growing value added prepared turkey products  such as deli meats  ground turkey  turkey burgers and sausage  roasted turkey and salads 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold our turkey processing operations in hinton  virginia 
the production from this facility  in addition to supplying product to our further processing operations  provided products that were sold primarily as commodity products 
our remaining processing facility is focused on producing a premium line of fresh and frozen whole turkeys 
we estimate that the restructuring of our turkey operations decreased our fiscal commodity turkey sales by approximately million 
most fresh turkey products are sold to established customers pursuant to agreements with varying terms that either set a fixed price or are subject to a market driven formula with some agreements based upon market prices reported by the usda and other public price reporting services  plus a markup  subject in many cases to minimum and maximum prices  which is dependent upon the customer s location  volume  product specifications and other factors 
we believe our practices with respect to sales of fresh turkey are generally consistent with those of our competitors with similar programs 
export and other turkey products overview 
prior to the restructuring of our turkey operations  our export and other turkey products consisted primarily of turkey parts sold in bulk  non branded form  frozen for distribution to export markets 
in fiscal  approximately million  or  of our total us turkey sales were attributable to export and other sales  with million  or  specifically related to export sales 
these exports and other products have historically been characterized by lower prices and greater price volatility than our value added product lines 
since the restructuring of our turkey operations  exports of turkey products have been nominal 
markets for chicken products foodservice 
the majority of our us chicken sales are derived from products sold to the foodservice market 
this market principally consists of chain restaurants  food processors  broad line distributors and certain other institutions located throughout the continental us we supply chicken products ranging from portion controlled refrigerated chicken parts to fully cooked and frozen  breaded or non breaded chicken parts or formed products 
we believe pilgrim s pride is well positioned to be the primary or secondary supplier to many national and international chain restaurants who require multiple suppliers of chicken products 
additionally  we believe we are well suited to be the sole supplier for many regional chain restaurants 
regional chain restaurants often offer better margin opportunities and a growing base of business 
we believe we have significant competitive strengths in terms of full line product capabilities  high volume production capacities  research and development expertise and extensive distribution and marketing experience relative to smaller and non vertically integrated producers 
while the overall chicken market has grown consistently  we believe the majority of this growth in recent years has been in the foodservice market 
according to the national chicken council  from through  sales of chicken products to the foodservice market grew at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately  versus growth for the chicken industry overall 
foodservice growth is anticipated to continue as food away from home expenditures continue to outpace overall industry rates 
according to the national restaurant association  food away from home expenditures grew at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately from through and are projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate from through as a result  the food away from home category is projected by the national restaurant association to account for of total food expenditures by  as compared with the current amount of 
due to internal growth and our fiscal acquisition  our sales to the foodservice market from fiscal through fiscal grew at a compounded annual growth rate of and represented of the net sales of our us chicken operations in fiscal foodservice prepared foods 
the majority of our sales to the foodservice market consist of prepared foods products 
our prepared chicken products sales to the foodservice market were  million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 
in addition to the significant increase in sales created by the fiscal acquisition  we attribute this growth in sales of prepared chicken products to the foodservice market to a number of factors first  there has been significant growth in the number of foodservice operators offering chicken on their menus and in the number of chicken items offered 
second  foodservice operators are increasingly purchasing prepared chicken products  which allow them to reduce labor costs while providing greater product consistency  quality and variety across all restaurant locations 
third  there is a strong need among larger foodservice companies for an alternative or additional supplier to our principal competitor in the prepared chicken products market 
a viable alternative supplier must be able to ensure supply  demonstrate innovation and new product development and provide competitive pricing 
we have been successful in our objective of becoming the alternative supplier of choice by being the primary or secondary prepared chicken products supplier to many large foodservice companies because we are vertically integrated  giving us control over our supply of chicken and chicken parts  our further processing facilities with a wide range of capabilities are particularly well suited to the high volume production as well as low volume custom production runs necessary to meet both the capacity and quality requirements of the foodservice market  and we have established a reputation for dependable quality  highly responsive service and excellent technical support 
fourth  as a result of the experience and reputation developed with larger customers  we have increasingly become the principal supplier to mid sized foodservice organizations 
fifth  our in house product development group follows a customer driven research and development focus designed to develop new products to meet customers changing needs 
our research and development personnel often work directly with institutional customers in developing products for these customers 
sixth  we are a leader in utilizing advanced processing technology  which enables us to better meet our customers needs for product innovation  consistent quality and cost efficiency 
foodservice fresh chicken 
we produce and market fresh  refrigerated chicken for sale to us quick service restaurant chains  delicatessens and other customers 
these chickens have the giblets removed  are usually of specific weight ranges  and are usually pre cut to customer specifications 
they are often marinated to enhance value and product differentiation 
by growing and processing to customers specifications  we are able to assist quick service restaurant chains in controlling costs and maintaining quality and size consistency of chicken pieces sold to the consumer 
retail 
the retail market consists primarily of grocery store chains  wholesale clubs and other retail distributors 
we concentrate our efforts in this market on sales of branded  prepackaged cut up and whole chicken to grocery store chains and retail distributors in the midwestern  southwestern  western and eastern regions of the us for a number of years  we have invested in both trade and retail marketing designed to establish high levels of brand name awareness and consumer preferences 
we utilize numerous marketing techniques  including advertising  to develop and strengthen trade and consumer awareness and increase brand loyalty for consumer products marketed under the pilgrim s pride brand 
our founder  lonnie bo pilgrim  is the featured spokesman in our television  radio and print advertising  and a trademark cameo of a person wearing a pilgrim s hat serves as the logo on all of our primary branded products 
as a result of this marketing strategy  pilgrim s pride is a well known brand name in a number of markets 
we believe our efforts to achieve and maintain brand awareness and loyalty help to provide more secure distribution for our products 
we also believe our efforts at brand awareness generate greater price premiums than would otherwise be the case in certain southwestern markets 
we also maintain an active program to identify consumer preferences 
the program primarily consists of discovering and validating new product ideas  packaging designs and methods through sophisticated qualitative and quantitative consumer research techniques in key geographic markets 
retail prepared foods 
we sell retail oriented prepared chicken products primarily to grocery store chains located in the midwestern  southwestern  western and eastern regions of the us our prepared chicken products sales to the retail market were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a compounded annual growth rate of approximately

retail fresh chicken 
our prepackaged retail products include various combinations of freshly refrigerated  whole chickens and chicken parts in trays  bags or other consumer packs labeled and priced ready for the retail grocer s fresh meat counter

we believe the retail prepackaged fresh chicken business will continue to be a large and relatively stable market  providing opportunities for product differentiation and regional brand loyalty 
export and other chicken products 
our export and other chicken products  with the exception of our exported prepared foods products  consist of whole chickens and chicken parts sold primarily in bulk  non branded form either refrigerated to distributors in the us or frozen for distribution to export markets 
in the us  prices of these products are negotiated daily or weekly and are generally related to market prices quoted by the usda or other public price reporting services 
we also sell us produced chicken products for export to eastern europe  including russia  the far east  mexico and other world markets 
historically  we have targeted international markets to generate additional demand for our chicken dark meat  which is a natural by product of our us operations given our concentration on prepared foods products and the us customers general preference for white meat 
we have also begun selling prepared chicken products for export to the international divisions of our us chain restaurant customers 
we believe that us chicken exports will continue to grow as worldwide demand increases for high grade  low cost protein sources 
we also believe that worldwide demand for higher margin prepared foods products will increase over the next several years 
accordingly  we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on such growth 
also included in these categories are chicken by products  which are converted into protein products and sold primarily to manufacturers of pet foods 
markets for turkey products foodservice 
a portion of our turkey sales are derived from products sold to the foodservice market 
this market principally consists of chain restaurants  food processors  foodservice distributors and certain other institutions located throughout the continental us after completion of the restructuring of our turkey operations described above  our turkey products include ready to cook turkey  fully cooked formed products  delicatessen products such as deli meats and sausage  salads  ground turkey and turkey burgers and other foodservice products 
we believe pilgrim s pride is well positioned to be the primary or secondary supplier to many chain restaurants that require multiple suppliers of turkey products 
additionally  we believe we are well suited to be the sole supplier for many regional chain restaurants 
foodservice prepared foods 
the majority of our turkey sales to the foodservice market consist of prepared turkey products 
our prepared turkey sales to the foodservice market were million of our sales in fiscal we believe that future growth in this segment will be attributable to the factors described above relating to the growth of prepared chicken sales to the foodservice market 
foodservice fresh turkey 
we produce and market fresh  refrigerated and frozen turkey for sale to foodservice distributors  restaurant chains and other customers 
these turkeys are usually of specific weight ranges and are usually whole birds to meet customer specifications 
they are often marinated to enhance value and product differentiation 
retail 
a significant portion of our turkey sales is derived from products sold to the retail market 
this market consists primarily of grocery store chains  wholesale clubs and other retail distributors 
we concentrate our efforts in this market on sales of branded  prepackaged whole turkey to grocery store chains and retail distributors in the eastern and southwestern regions of the us we believe this regional marketing focus enables us to develop consumer brand franchises and capitalize on proximity to the trade customer in terms of lower transportation costs  more timely and responsive service and enhanced product freshness 
we utilize numerous marketing techniques  including advertising  to develop and strengthen trade and consumer awareness and increase brand loyalty for consumer products marketed generally under the pilgrim s pride and pilgrim s signature tm brands 
we believe our efforts to achieve and maintain brand awareness and loyalty help to provide more secure distribution for our products 
we also believe our efforts at brand awareness generate greater price premiums than would otherwise be the case in certain eastern markets 
we also maintain an active program to identify consumer preferences 
the program primarily consists of testing new product ideas  packaging designs and methods through sophisticated qualitative and quantitative consumer research techniques in key geographic markets 
retail prepared foods 
we sell retail oriented prepared turkey products primarily to grocery store chains located in the eastern us we also sell these products to the wholesale club industry 
retail fresh turkey 
our prepackaged  retail products include various combinations of freshly refrigerated and frozen whole turkey in bags as well as frozen ground turkey and turkey burgers 
we believe the retail prepackaged fresh turkey business will continue to be a large and relatively stable market  providing opportunities for product differentiation and regional brand loyalty with large seasonal spikes during the holiday seasons 
markets for other products we have regional distribution centers located in arizona  california  florida  iowa  louisiana  mississippi  north carolina  texas  utah  and wisconsin that are primarily focused on distributing our own poultry products  however  the distribution centers also distribute certain poultry and non poultry products purchased from third parties to independent grocers and quick service restaurants 
our non poultry distribution business is conducted as an accommodation to our customers and to achieve greater economies of scale in distribution logistics 
poultry sales from our regional distribution centers are included in the chicken and turkey sales amounts contained in the above tables  however  all non poultry sales amounts are contained in the other products 
we believe the store door delivery capabilities for our own poultry products provide a strategic service advantage in selling to quick service  national chain restaurants 
we market fresh eggs under the pilgrim s pride brand name  as well as under private labels  in various sizes of cartons and flats to us retail grocery and institutional foodservice customers located primarily in texas 
we have a housing capacity for approximately million commercial egg laying hens which can produce approximately million dozen eggs annually 
us egg prices are determined weekly based upon reported market prices 
the us egg industry has been consolidating over the last few years  with the largest producers accounting for more than of the total number of egg laying hens in service during we compete with other us egg producers primarily on the basis of product quality  reliability  price and customer service 
we market a high nutrient egg called eggsplus 
this egg contains high levels of omega and omega fatty acids along with vitamin e  making the egg a heart friendly product 
our marketing of eggsplus has received national recognition for our progress in being an innovator in the functional foods category 
in addition  we produce and sell livestock feeds at our feed mill in mt 
pleasant  texas and at our farm supply store in pittsburg  texas to dairy farmers and livestock producers in northeastern texas 
we engage in similar sales activities at our other us feed mills 
mexico background the mexico market represented approximately of our net sales in fiscal we are the second largest producer of chicken in mexico 
we believe that our facilities are among the most technologically advanced in mexico and that we are one of the lowest cost producers of chicken in mexico 
product types while the market for chicken products in mexico is less developed than in the us  with sales attributed to fewer  more basic products  we believe the market for value added products is increasing 
our strategy is to lead this trend 
we have increased our sales of value added products  primarily through national retail chains and restaurants  and it is our business strategy to continue to do so 
markets we sell our mexico chicken products primarily to large wholesalers and retailers 
our customer base in mexico covers a broad geographic area from mexico city  the capital of mexico with a population estimated to be between and million  to saltillo  the capital of the state of coahuila  about miles north of mexico city  and from tampico and veracruz on the gulf of mexico to acapulco on the pacific  which region includes the cities of san luis potosi and queretaro  capitals of the states of the same name  and cancun on the caribbean 
foreign operations risks our foreign operations pose special risks to our business and operations 
see item a 
risk factors for a discussion of foreign operations risks 
general competitive conditions the chicken and turkey industries are highly competitive and our largest us competitor has greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
in the us  mexico and puerto rico we compete principally with other vertically integrated poultry companies 
we are the second largest producer of poultry in both the united states and mexico and the largest in puerto rico 
the largest producer in the united states is tyson foods  inc and in mexico  the largest is industrias bachoco sa de cv 
in general  the competitive factors in the us chicken and turkey industries include price  product quality  product development  brand identification  breadth of product line and customer service 
competitive factors vary by major market 
in the foodservice market  competition is based on consistent quality  product development  service and price 
in the us retail market  we believe that product quality  brand awareness  customer service and price are the primary bases of competition 
there is some competition with non vertically integrated further processors in the us prepared food business 
we believe vertical integration generally provides significant  long term cost and quality advantages over non vertically integrated further processors 
in mexico  where product differentiation has traditionally been limited  product quality  service and price have been the most critical competitive factors 
the north american free trade agreement  which went into effect on january   required annual reductions in tariffs for chicken and chicken products in order to eliminate those tariffs by january  on november  the mexican secretariat of the economy announced it would initiate an investigation to determine whether a temporary safeguard action was warranted to protect the domestic poultry industry when import tariffs on poultry were eliminated in january the action stemmed from concerns of the union nacional avicultores una that duty free imports of leg quarters would injure the mexico poultry industry 
in july  the us and mexico entered into a safeguard agreement with regard to imports into mexico of chicken leg quarters from the us under this agreement  a tariff rate for chicken leg quarters of of the sales price was established 
the tariff rate on import duties was reduced on january   to  and in each of the following three years the tariff rate is to be reduced in equal increments so that the final tariff rate on january  will be zero 
as such tariffs are reduced  we expect greater amounts of chicken to be imported into mexico from the us  which could negatively affect the profitability of mexican chicken producers and positively affect the profitability of us exporters of chicken to mexico 
although this could have a negative impact on our mexican chicken operations  we believe that this will be mitigated by the close proximity of our us operations to the mexican border 
we have the largest us production and distribution capacities near the mexican border  which gives us a strategic advantage to capitalize on exports of us chicken to mexico 
while the extent of the impact of the elimination of tariffs is uncertain  we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this elimination for two reasons 
first  we have an extensive distribution network in mexico  which distributes products to of the mexican states  encompassing approximately of the total population of mexico 
we believe this distribution network will be an important asset in distributing our own  as well as other companies  us produced chicken into mexico 
second  we have the largest us production and distribution capacities near the mexican border  which will provide us with cost advantages in exporting us chicken into mexico 
these facilities include our processing facilities in mt 
pleasant  lufkin  nacogdoches  dallas and waco  texas  and distribution facilities in san antonio and el paso  texas and phoenix  arizona 
we are not a significant competitor in the distribution business as it relates to products other than poultry 
we distribute these products solely as a convenience to our poultry customers 
the broad line distributors do not consider us to be a factor in those markets 
the competition related to our other products such as table eggs  feed and protein are much more regionalized and no one competitor is dominant 
key customers our two largest customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  and our largest customer  wal mart stores  inc accounted for of our net sales 
regulation and environmental matters the chicken and turkey industries are subject to government regulation  particularly in the health and environmental areas  including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  by the centers for disease control  the usda  the food and drug administration fda and the environmental protection agency epa in the us and by similar governmental agencies in mexico 
our chicken processing facilities in the us are subject to on site examination  inspection and regulation by the usda 
the fda inspects the production of our feed mills in the us our mexican food processing facilities and feed mills are subject to on site examination  inspection and regulation by a mexican governmental agency  which performs functions similar to those performed by the usda and fda 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the operations of our facilities 
we anticipate increased regulation by the usda concerning food safety  by the fda concerning the use of medications in feed and by the epa and various other state agencies concerning discharges to the environment 
although  we do not anticipate any regulations having a material adverse effect upon us  a material adverse effect may occur 
employees and labor relations as of october   we employed approximately  persons in the us and  persons in mexico 
approximately  employees at various facilities in the us are members of collective bargaining units 
in mexico   of our hourly employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we have not experienced any work stoppage at any location in over five years 
we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
at any given time we will be in some stage of contract negotiation with various collective bargaining units

risk factors forward looking statements statements of our intentions  beliefs  expectations or predictions for the future  denoted by the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  project  imply  intend  foresee and similar expressions  are forward looking statements that reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include those described under risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements as a result of these factors  among others  many of which are beyond our control 
in making these statements  we are not undertaking  and specifically decline to undertake  any obligation to address or update each or any factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results  and we are not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have caused changes in information contained in previous filings or communications 
though we have attempted to list comprehensively these important cautionary risk factors  we wish to caution investors and others that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting our business or results of operations 
risk factors cyclicality and commodity prices 
industry cyclicality can affect our earnings  especially due to fluctuations in commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey 
profitability in the chicken and turkey industries is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey  which are determined by supply and demand factors 
as a result  the chicken and turkey industries are subject to cyclical earnings fluctuations 
the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
in particular  weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in an unpredictable manner 
a sudden and significant change in weather patterns could affect supplies of feed ingredients  as well as both the industry s and our ability to obtain feed ingredients  grow chickens and turkeys or deliver products 
high feed ingredient prices have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past 
we periodically seek  in some instances  to enter into advance purchase commitments or financial hedging contracts for the purchase of feed ingredients in an effort to manage our feed ingredient costs 
however  we may not hedge feed ingredient cost risk unless requested by a specific customer or it is otherwise deemed prudent and any use of such instruments may not be successful 
livestock and poultry disease  including avian influenza 
outbreaks of livestock diseases in general and poultry diseases in particular  including avian influenza  can significantly affect our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products 
we take reasonable precautions to ensure that our flocks are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary and environmentally sound manner 
however  events beyond our control  such as the outbreaks of disease  either in our own flocks or elsewhere  could significantly affect demand for our products or our ability to conduct our operations 
furthermore  an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken  turkey or other products to or from our suppliers  facilities or customers  or require us to destroy one or more of our flocks 
this could also result in the cancellation of orders by our customers and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our business  reputation and prospects 
in recent months there has been substantial publicity regarding a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza  known as hn  which has been affecting asia since and which has recently been found in eastern europe 
it is widely believed that hn is being spread by migratory birds  such as ducks and geese 
there have also been some cases where hn is believed to have passed from birds to humans as humans came into contact with live birds that were infected with the disease 
although hn has not been identified in north america  there have been outbreaks of low pathogenic strains of avian influenza in north america  including in the us in and and in mexico for the past several years  including this year  that have impacted our operations 
further  these low pathogenic outbreaks have not generated the same level of concern  or received the same level of publicity or been accompanied by the same reduction in demand for poultry products in certain countries as that associated with the highly pathogenic hn strain 
accordingly  even if the hn strain does not spread to north america  there can be no assurance that it will not materially adversely affect demand for north american produced poultry internationally and or domestically  and  if it were to spread to north america  there can be no assurance that it would not significantly affect our ability to conduct our operations and or demand for our products  in each case in a manner having a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and or prospects 
contamination of products 
if our poultry products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
poultry products may be subject to contamination by disease producing organisms  or pathogens  such as listeria monocytogenes  salmonella and generic e 
coli 
these pathogens are generally found in the environment  and  as a result  there is a risk that they  as a result of food processing  could be present in our processed poultry products 
these pathogens can also be introduced as a result of improper handling at the further processing  foodservice or consumer level 
these risks may be controlled  although not eliminated  by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing 
we have little  if any  control over proper handling once the product has been shipped 
illness and death may result if the pathogens are not eliminated at the further processing  foodservice or consumer level 
even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products is a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims  product recalls and increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies and may have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and prospects 
in october  one product sample produced in our franconia  pennsylvania facility that had not been shipped to customers tested positive for listeria 
we later received information from the usda suggesting environmental samples taken at the facility had tested positive for both the strain of listeria identified in the product and a strain having characteristics similar to those of the strain identified in a northeastern listeria outbreak 
as a result  we voluntarily recalled all cooked deli products produced at the plant from may  through october  we carried insurance designed to cover the direct recall related expenses and certain aspects of the related business interruption caused by the recall 
we estimate that the sales in our turkey division were negatively affected by approximately million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for those same periods  we estimate that operating margins were negatively affected by approximately to million and to million  respectively 
aggregating the direct recall expense claim with the anticipated business interruption and product re establishment costs  our total loss was approximately million  although our policy limit was million 
we received million of this amount in fiscal and the remaining million in fiscal from our insurer 
product liability 
product liability claims or product recalls can adversely affect our business reputation and expose us to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulators 
the packaging  marketing and distribution of food products entail an inherent risk of product liability and product recall and the resultant adverse publicity 
we may be subject to significant liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury  illness or death 
we could be required to recall certain of our products in the event of contamination or damage to the products 
in addition to the risks of product liability or product recall due to deficiencies caused by our production or processing operations  we may encounter the same risks if any third party tampers with our products 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to perform product recalls  or that product liability claims will not be asserted against us  in the future 
any claims that may be made may create adverse publicity that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
as described above under contamination of products  if our poultry products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
in october  we voluntarily recalled all cooked deli products produced at one of our facilities from may  through october  in connection with this recall  we were named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits brought by individuals alleging injuries resulting from contracting listeria monocytogenes 
see item legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that any litigation or reputational injury associated with this or any future product recalls will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
insurance 
we are exposed to risks relating to product liability  product recall  property damage and injuries to persons for which insurance coverage is expensive  limited and potentially inadequate 
our business operations entail a number of risks  including risks relating to product liability claims  product recalls  property damage and injuries to persons 
we currently maintain insurance with respect to certain of these risks  including product liability insurance  property insurance  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance  but in many cases such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and no assurance can be given that such insurance can be maintained in the future on acceptable terms  or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to any such events  or at all 
moreover  even though our insurance coverage may be designed to protect us from losses attributable to certain events  it may not adequately protect us from liability and expenses we incur in connection with such events 
for example  the losses attributable to our october recall of cooked deli products produced at one of our facilities significantly exceeded available insurance coverage 
additionally  in the past two of our insurers encountered financial difficulties and were unable to fulfill their obligations under the insurance policies as anticipated and separately two of our other insurers contested coverage with respect to claims covered under policies purchased  forcing us to litigate the issue of coverage before we were able to collect under these policies 
government regulation 
regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting our business 
the chicken and turkey industries are subject to federal  state and local governmental regulation  including in the health and environmental areas 
we anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety  the use of medication in feed formulations and the disposal of poultry by products and wastewater discharges 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect our business or operations in the future 
significant competition 
competition in the chicken and turkey industries with other vertically integrated poultry companies  especially companies with greater resources  may make us unable to compete successfully in these industries  which could adversely affect our business 
the chicken and turkey industries are highly competitive 
some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than us 
in both the us and mexico  we primarily compete with other vertically integrated poultry companies 
in general  the competitive factors in the us poultry industry include price  product quality  brand identification  breadth of product line  and customer service 
competitive factors vary by major market 
in the foodservice market  competition is based on consistent quality  product development  service and price 
in the us retail market  we believe that competition is based on product quality  brand awareness  customer service and price 
further  there is some competition with non vertically integrated further processors in the prepared food business 
in mexico  where product differentiation has traditionally been limited  product quality and price have been the most critical competitive factors 
additionally  the north american free trade agreement  which went into effect on january   required annual reductions in tariffs for chicken and chicken products in order to eliminate those tariffs by january  on november   the mexican secretariat of the economy announced that it would initiate an investigation to determine whether a temporary safeguard action was warranted to protect the domestic poultry industry when import tariffs on poultry were eliminated in january in july  the us and mexico entered into a safeguard agreement with regard to imports into mexico of chicken leg quarters from the us under this agreement  a tariff rate for chicken leg quarters of of the sales price was established 
this tariff was reduced on january  to and is to be reduced in each of the following three years in equal increments so that the final tariff rate at january  will be zero 
as those tariffs are reduced  increased competition from chicken imported into mexico from the us may have a material adverse effect on the mexican chicken industry in general  and on our mexican operations in particular 
loss of key customers 
the loss of one or more of our largest customers could adversely affect our business 
our two largest customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  and our largest customer  wal mart stores  inc accounted for of our net sales 
our business could suffer significant set backs in revenues and operating income if we lost one or more of our largest customers  or if our customers plans and or markets should change significantly 
potential acquisitions 
we intend to pursue opportunities to acquire complementary businesses  which could increase leverage and debt service requirements and could adversely affect our financial situation if we fail to successfully integrate the acquired business 
we intend to pursue selective acquisitions of complementary businesses in the future 
inherent in any future acquisitions are certain risks such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following such acquisitions 
additional debt or equity capital may be required to complete future acquisitions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the required capital 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  the need to integrate acquired operations  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  lack of experience in operating in the geographical market of the acquired business  and an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of these and other factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated cash flows at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
assumption of unknown liabilities in acquisitions 
assumption of unknown liabilities in acquisitions may harm our financial condition and operating results 
acquisitions may be structured in such a manner that would result in the assumption of unknown liabilities not disclosed by the seller or uncovered during pre acquisition due diligence 
for example  our acquisition of the conagra chicken division was structured as a stock purchase 
in that acquisition we assumed all of the liabilities of the conagra chicken division  including liabilities that may be unknown 
we negotiated and obtained from conagra foods certain representations and warranties concerning contingent liabilities and other obligations of the entities holding the conagra chicken division assets to reduce the risk that we will bear such subsidiaries liability for unknown liabilities 
conagra foods also agreed to indemnify us for breaches of representations and warranties concerning the pre closing operations of the conagra chicken division and for certain liabilities of the entities holding the conagra chicken division assets 
conagra foods indemnification obligations are generally subject to a million deductible  and there may be circumstances in which conagra foods indemnification obligations do not provide us protection from contingent or other obligations of the entities holding the conagra chicken division assets  or other pre closing liabilities of the conagra chicken division 
these obligations and liabilities could harm our financial condition and operating results 
leverage 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt securities 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition which could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  limit our ability to obtain necessary financing and to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit our ability to pursue acquisitions and sell assets  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  our ability to borrow additional funds 
failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default or require redemption of indebtedness 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is dependent on various factors 
these factors include the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
despite our indebtedness  we are not prohibited from incurring significant additional indebtedness in the future 
if additional debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
foreign operations risks 
our foreign operations pose special risks to our business and operations 
we have significant operations and assets located in mexico 
foreign operations are subject to a number of special risks  including among others currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  expropriation  and changes in laws and policies  including those governing foreign owned operations 
currency exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected us in the past 
exchange rate fluctuations or one or more other risks may have a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future 
our operations in mexico are conducted through subsidiaries organized under the laws of mexico 
we may rely in part on intercompany loans and distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
claims of creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  will generally have priority as to the assets of our subsidiaries over our claims 
additionally  the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make payments and distributions to us will be subject to  among other things  mexican law 
in the past  these laws have not had a material adverse effect on the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions 
however  laws such as these may have a material adverse effect on the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions in the future 
despite our indebtedness  we are not prohibited from incurring significant additional indebtedness in the future 
if additional debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
control of voting stock 
control over pilgrim s pride is maintained by members of the family of lonnie bo pilgrim 
as described in more detail in item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters  through two limited partnerships and related trusts and voting agreements  lonnie bo pilgrim  patty r 
pilgrim  his wife  and lonnie ken pilgrim  his son  control over of the voting power of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  they control the outcome of all actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or other sale of pilgrim s pride or its assets 
this ensures their ability to control the foreseeable future direction and management of pilgrim s pride 
in addition  an event of default under certain agreements related to our indebtedness will occur if lonnie bo pilgrim and certain members of his family cease to own at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding common stock

item legal proceedings on july   three individuals  on behalf of themselves and a putative class of chicken growers  filed their original class action complaint against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  texarkana division  styled cody wheeler  et al 
vs 
pilgrim s pride corporation 
the complaint alleges that we violated the packers and stockyards act usc section and breached fiduciary duties allegedly owed to the plaintiff growers 
the plaintiffs also brought individual actions under the packers and stockyards act alleging common law fraud  negligence  breach of fiduciary duties and breach of contract 
recently  on september   plaintiffs amended their lawsuit to join tyson foods  inc as a co defendant 
two additional former chicken growers were also added as plaintiffs to the lawsuit 
this amendment  which occurred months after the lawsuit s filing also results in a virtual re writing of the allegations 
now plaintiffs contend that the company and tyson are involved in a conspiracy to violate federal antitrust laws 
plaintiffs initial allegations  although still contained in the amended lawsuit  are no longer the sole focus of the case 
the company intends to defend vigorously both certification of the case as a class action and plaintiffs individual claims 
we do not expect this matter to have a material impact on our financial position  operations or liquidity 
in october  a limited number of usda environmental samples from our franconia  pennsylvania plant tested positive for listeria

through vertical integration we control the breeding  hatching and growing of chickens 
we operate in three business segments and two geographical areas 
executive summary the following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the discussion and analysis that follows consolidated operating results 
the changes in the company s net income and net income per common share basic and diluted for the fiscal year ended october  from the fiscal year ended october  were due primarily to the following in millions except per share data net income earnings per share for the fiscal year ended october  fiscal items impacting net income turkey restructuring and related charges in non recurring recoveries in proforma fiscal acquisition lower effective income tax rate subtotal fiscal items impacting net income breach of contract litigation all other  primarily improved operations for the fiscal year ended october  see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of net income amounts in results of operations  below 
turkey restructuring and related charges in we restructured our turkey operations in fiscal and recorded total restructuring charges of million pre tax 
for further details  see note c restructuring charges and non recurring recoveries to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and results of operations 
non recurring recoveries in we had non recurring recoveries for business interruption insurance and other material items in fiscal amounting to million pre tax 
for further details  see note c restructuring charges and non recurring recoveries to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
proforma fiscal acquisition 
the acquisition of the conagra chicken division occurred effective november  therefore  fiscal results did not include eight weeks of the fiscal acquisition s activities 
also includes the effect on earnings per share for the full proforma fiscal year as if the million shares issued for the acquisition were outstanding for the full year 
for further details  see note b business acquisition to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
lower effective income tax rate 
our reported effective income tax rate decreased by percentage points to resulting primarily from increased income from our mexico operations which is taxed at a lower rate 
breach of contract litigation 
miscellaneous income of million pre tax was recorded in fiscal relating to the litigation related to a breach of contract that was settled through arbitration 
all other  primarily improved operations 
the increase in results was due primarily to the following increase in operating income related to us chicken sales as a result of a decrease in average feed costs when considered on a stable sales pricing and volume basis 
increase in operating income related to mexico chicken sales as a result of average sales prices increasing and an decrease in average feed costs 
decrease in operating loss from turkey segment due primarily to the change in product mix created by the turkey restructuring 
decrease in operating income from other product operations due to competitive pressures in the sale of table eggs  protein and non poultry products sold by our distributions centers 
business environment profitability in the poultry industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey  which are determined by supply and demand factors 
as a result  the chicken and turkey industries are subject to cyclical earnings fluctuations 
cyclical earnings fluctuations can be mitigated somewhat by business strategy  product mix  sales and marketing plans  and operating efficiencies 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  we have concentrated on the production and marketing of prepared foods products 
prepared foods products generally have higher profit margins than our other products 
also  the production and sale in the us of prepared foods products reduces the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our profitability 
feed ingredient purchases are the single largest component of our cost of sales  representing approximately of our consolidated cost of sales in fiscal the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the us and foreign governments 
as further processing is performed  feed ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product s total production cost  thereby reducing their impact on our profitability 
products sold in this form enable us to charge a premium  reduce the impact of feed ingredient costs on our profitability and improve and stabilize our profit margins 
as a significant portion of the us poultry production is exported  the commodity prices of chicken and turkey can be  and in recent periods have been  adversely affected by disruptions in poultry export markets 
these disruptions are often caused by restriction on imports of us produced poultry products imposed by foreign governments for a variety of reasons  including the protection of their domestic poultry producers and allegations of consumer health issues 
for example  russia and japan have restricted the importation of us produced poultry for both of these reasons in recent periods 
in july  the us and mexico entered into a safeguard agreement with regard to imports into mexico of chicken leg quarters from the us under this agreement  a tariff rate for chicken leg quarters of of the sales price was established 
this tariff rate was reduced on january  to and is scheduled to be reduced in each of the following three years in equal increments so that the final tariff rate at january  will be zero 
the tariff was imposed due to concerns that the duty free importation of such products as provided by the north american free trade agreement would injure mexico s poultry industry 
as such tariffs are reduced  we expect greater amounts of chicken to be imported into mexico from the us  which could negatively affect the profitability of mexican chicken producers and positively affect the profitability of us exporters of chicken to mexico 
although this could have a negative impact on our mexican chicken operations  we believe that this will be mitigated by the close proximity of our us operations to the mexico border 
we have the largest us production and distribution capacities near the mexican border  which gives us a strategic advantage to capitalize on exports of us chicken to mexico 
because these disruptions in poultry export markets are often political  no assurances can be given as to when the existing disruptions will be alleviated or that new ones will not arise 
business segments we operate in three reportable business segments as a producer and seller of chicken products  a producer and seller of turkey products and other products 
in previous years  our presented segments included chicken and other and turkey 
after fully integrating the former conagra chicken division into our operations during fiscal and early fiscal  we changed our segment presentation to separate our non chicken and non turkey operations into a separate category consistent with management s evaluation of operating results and decisions with respect to the allocation of resources 
our chicken segment includes sales of chicken products we produce and purchase for resale in the us  including puerto rico  and mexico 
our chicken segment conducts separate operations in the us and puerto rico and in mexico and is reported as two separate geographical areas 
substantially all of the assets and operations of the recently acquired conagra chicken division are included in our us chicken segment since the date of acquisition 
our turkey segment includes sales of turkey products we produce and purchase for resale in our turkey and distribution operations  operating in the us our other products segment includes distribution of non poultry products that are purchased from third parties and sold to independent grocers and quick service restaurants 
also included in this category are sales of table eggs  feed  protein products and other items  some of which are produced by the company 
inter area sales and inter segment sales  which are not material  are accounted for at prices comparable to normal trade customer sales 
corporate expenses are allocated to mexico based upon various apportionment methods for specific expenditures incurred related thereto with the remaining amounts allocated to the us portions of the segments based on number of employees 
assets associated with our corporate functions  including cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities 
selling  general and administrative expenses related to our distribution centers are allocated based on the proportion of net sales to the particular segment to which the product sales relate 
depreciation and amortization  total assets and capital expenditures of our distribution centers are included in chicken based on the primary focus of the centers 
non recurring recoveries  which represent settlements for vitamin and methionine litigation covering several periods as well as federal compensation for avian influenza  have not been allocated to any segment because the proper allocation cannot be readily determined 
the following table presents certain information regarding our segments fiscal year ended october  october  a b september  a in thousands net sales to customers chicken united states mexico sub total turkey other products united states mexico sub total total operating income loss chicken united states mexico sub total turkey c other products united states mexico sub total non recurring recoveries d total depreciation and amortization e chicken united states mexico sub total turkey other products united states mexico sub total total total assets chicken united states mexico sub total turkey other products united states mexico sub total total capital expenditures chicken united states mexico sub total turkey other products united states mexico sub total total a certain historical amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation 
b the company acquired the conagra chicken division on november  for million 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations for this acquisition have been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date 
c included in fiscal are restructuring charges totaling million offset somewhat by the non recurring recovery of million representing the gain recognized on the insurance proceeds received in connection with the october recall 
in addition  the company estimates its losses related to the october recall excluding the insurance recovery described above negatively affected gross profit and operating income by million in fiscal and million in fiscal d non recurring recoveries which have not been allocated to the individual segments are as follows in millions october  september  avian influenza vitamin methionine total e includes amortization of capitalized financing costs of approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the following table presents certain items as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended october  october  september  net sales cost and expenses cost of sales cost of sales restructuring non recurring recoveries gross profit selling  general and administrative expense other restructuring charges operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes net income results of operations our results of operations for fiscal when compared to fiscal were impacted by the following significant items 
first  on november  we completed the purchase of the conagra chicken division 
we sometimes refer to this acquisition as the fiscal acquisition 
the acquired business has been included in our results of operations for only of the weeks in fiscal second  on april  we announced a plan to restructure our turkey business 
the company sold the related facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded  as cost of sales restructuring  million  primarily due to asset impairments and inventory losses on discontinued products  and  as other restructuring charges  million  primarily related to exit and severance costs 
commodity sales in our turkey division decreased by approximately million in fiscal as a result of this restructuring 
third  fiscal included weeks versus fiscal  which included weeks  resulting in a decrease in each of the categories discussed in our results of operations by approximately as compared to the corresponding period in the preceding year 
as this change impacted all the income statement categories in a reasonably consistent manner  no separate discussion of this factor is included in our results of operations discussion  unless the impact of the applicable category varied from the decrease described above 
finally  in october  one product sample produced in our franconia  pennsylvania facility that had not been shipped to customers tested positive for listeria 
we later received information from the usda suggesting environmental samples taken at the facility had tested positive for both the strain of listeria identified in the product and a strain having characteristics similar to those of the strain identified in a northeastern listeria outbreak 
as a result  we voluntarily recalled all cooked deli products produced at the plant from may  through october  we estimate that gross profit and operating income were negatively affected by this product recall by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal prior to the insurance recovery discussed below 
we carry insurance designed to cover the direct recall related expenses and certain aspects of the related business interruption caused by a recall 
as a result of this recall  the company s insurance claim for business interruption and certain product re establishment costs amounted to approximately million for the period from the date of the recall through october   the one year anniversary of the recall and the insurance policy time limitation period for business interruption loss recovery 
aggregating the direct recall expense claim with the anticipated business interruption and product re establishment costs  our total loss was approximately million  although our policy limit was million 
we received million of this amount in fiscal and the remaining million in fiscal from our insurer 
in connection with the receipt of the insurance proceeds  we recognized million as a component of non recurring recoveries in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal the following table provides additional information regarding net sales in millions fiscal year ended october  change from percentage source fiscal change chicken united states a mexico b turkey c other products united states d mexico e a us chicken sales increased primarily due to the inclusion of the fiscal acquisition  for weeks in fiscal versus weeks in fiscal b mexico chicken sales after adjusting for a week year in increased primarily due to a increase in total revenue per pound produced  partially offset by a decline in dressed pounds produced 
c the decrease in turkey sales was due primarily to our fiscal restructuring of our turkey operations 
see note c restructuring charges and non recurring recoveries of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
we estimate that commodity sales in our turkey division decreased by approximately million in fiscal as a result of this restructuring 
d us sales of other products increased primarily due to the inclusion of the distribution centers of the fiscal acquisition for weeks in fiscal versus weeks in fiscal also affecting the us sales of other products was a decline in pricing for products at our commercial egg operations and our rendering plants 
e mexico other products sales decreased due to reduced sales volumes of our commercial feed 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal the following table provides gross profit information in millions fiscal year ended percentage percentage october  october  change from percentage of net sales of net sales components fiscal change fiscal fiscal net sales cost of sales a cost of sales restructuring b non recurring recoveries c gross profit a cost of sales in the us chicken operations increased million due primarily to the fiscal acquisition  offset partially by the cost of feed ingredient purchases averaging lower in cost in fiscal compared to the prior year 
cost of sales in our turkey operations decreased significantly because of the restructuring of this division in fiscal cost of sales in our mexico operations decreased million primarily due to a decline in production volumes after adjusting for a week year in  and a decrease in average cost of feed ingredient purchases 
b on april   we announced a plan to restructure our turkey business to significantly reduce our production of commodity turkey meat and strengthen our focus on value added turkey products 
as part of our restructuring effort  we sold our hinton  virginia turkey commodity meat operations 
in fiscal we recorded  as cost of sales restructuring  approximately million of asset impairment charges and inventory losses on discontinued products and  as other restructuring charges  million  primarily related to exit and severance costs 
c non recurring recoveries in fiscal year consisted mainly of a million gain from insurance proceeds related to our product recall 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal compared to fiscal increased million  or  as described in the following table in millions fiscal year ended october  change from percentage source fiscal change chicken united states mexico turkey other products united states mexico non recurring recoveries operating income fiscal year ended percentage percentage october  change from percentage of net sales of net sales components fiscal change fiscal fiscal gross profit selling  general and administrative expense a other restructuring charges b operating income c a selling  general and administrative expense increased due to costs associated with increased sales of prepared foods because of the fiscal acquisition and due to increases in costs associated with our profit based retirement and compensation plans 
b on april   we announced a plan to restructure our turkey division  including the sale or closure of some facilities in virginia 
approximately million related to exit and severance costs in connection with the restructuring were charged to other restructuring charges 
c the increase in operating income over fiscal is due primarily to lower feed ingredient pricing  the million in turkey restructuring and other related restructuring charges sustained in fiscal and the other items described above 
interest expense 
consolidated interest expense decreased to million in fiscal  when compared to million for fiscal  due primarily to lower average outstanding debt balances experienced in the fiscal year 
interest income 
interest income increased to million compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to the increase in funds available to invest created by the increase in net income 
income tax expense 
consolidated income tax expense in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal this increase in consolidated income tax expense is the result of higher pretax earnings in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was versus for fiscal this decrease is due primarily to the increase in net income before tax in our mexico operations which is taxed at a lower rate than our us operations 
offsetting this is a million provision for anticipated repatriations from mexico under the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act of includes a temporary incentive to us multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings at an approximate effective us federal tax rate 
the provision discussed above represents applications of the us federal income tax on the minimum anticipated repatriation expected in fiscal the company continues to further evaluate its reinvestment and repatriation opportunities and may be able to accomplish additional repatriations in fiscal the tax consequences on additional repatriations will be recorded upon completion of detailed repatriation plans 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased billion  or  over fiscal the following table provides additional information regarding net sales in millions fiscal year ended change october  fiscal from percentage source change chicken united states a mexico turkey b other products united states c mexico a us chicken sales increased primarily due to the fiscal acquisition which we estimate contributed approximately billion since the acquisition 
also affecting the us chicken sales was an increase of in total revenue per dressed pound produced  primarily due to significantly higher component market chicken prices during the year as compared to fiscal b the decrease in turkey sales was due to a decrease in turkey production created by a reduction in turkey flocks beginning in july  offset by an increase in revenue per pound produced 
c we estimate the fiscal acquisition contributed approximately million to sales of other products primarily due the acquired distribution business 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal the following table provides gross profit information in millions fiscal year ended percentage percentage october  change from percentage of net sales of net sales components fiscal change fiscal fiscal net sales cost of sales a cost of sales restructuring b non recurring recoveries c gross profit a cost of sales in the us operations increased  million due primarily to the fiscal acquisition  as well as significantly higher feed ingredient costs in fiscal compared to the prior year 
our mexico operations had a million increase primarily due to higher feed ingredient costs 
chicken component market prices reached their highest level in the us since during our fiscal third quarter 
since that time  the reference chicken component market prices declined significantly 
however  partially offsetting this decline in component market chicken prices were declines in prices for corn and soybean meal  which comprised of our consolidated cost of sales in fiscal b on april   we announced a plan to restructure our turkey business to significantly reduce our production of commodity turkey meat and strengthen our focus on value added turkey products 
as part of our restructuring effort  we sold our hinton  virginia turkey commodity meat operations 
in fiscal we recorded  as cost of sales restructuring  approximately million of asset impairment charges and inventory losses on discontinued products and  as other restructuring charges  million  primarily related to exit and severance costs 
c non recurring recoveries in fiscal year consisted mainly of a million gain from insurance proceeds related to our product recall 
in fiscal  we had non recurring recoveries of million consisting of million in payments from the federal government to compensate producers for avian influenza losses and million related to the anti trust lawsuits involving vitamins and methionine 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal compared to fiscal increased million  or  as described in the following table in millions fiscal year ended october  change from percentage source fiscal change chicken united states mexico turkey other products united states mexico non recurring recoveries operating income fiscal year ended percentage percentage october  change from percentage of net sales of net sales components fiscal change fiscal fiscal gross profit selling  general and administrative expense a other restructuring charges b operating income c a selling  general and administrative expense increased million due primarily to the fiscal acquisition  but decreased as a percent of sales primarily due to the fixed nature of certain expenses in relation to increased sales 
b on april   we announced a plan to restructure our turkey division  including the sale or closure of some facilities in virginia 
approximately million related to exit and severance costs in connection with the restructuring were charged to other restructuring charges 
c operating income for us chicken of million is offset by operating losses of million in mexico and million for turkey 
the loss in mexico compared to operating income of million in fiscal is primarily due to increased feed cost 
the loss for turkey compared to a loss of million in fiscal is primarily due to our restructuring noted above  the continuing effect of the recall and significant losses on commodity turkey sales 
interest expense 
consolidated interest expense increased to million in fiscal  when compared to million for fiscal  due primarily to higher average outstanding debt balances experienced in the fiscal year due to the financing of the fiscal acquisition partially offset by significant debt repayment with excess cash flow in fiscal interest income 
consolidated interest income increased to million compared to million in fiscal due to excess cash available during fiscal as net income increased 
income tax expense 
consolidated income tax expense in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal this increase in consolidated income tax expense is the result of higher pretax earnings in fiscal fiscal income tax expense was significantly reduced by a tax benefit recorded in fiscal of approximately million to reflect the benefit resulting from a reduction in valuation allowance of the net operating loss carry forwards for mexican tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents our available sources of liquidity as of october  in thousands 
facility available amount available source of liquidity amount borrowing outstanding in millions cash and cash equivalents investments in available for sale securities debt facilities revolving credit facilities revolving term facility receivables purchase agreement total available as of october   we had million in revolving credit facilities and million in a secured revolving term borrowing facility 
borrowings under the revolving term borrowing facility are available on a revolving basis until april  at which time the outstanding borrowings will be converted to a term loan 
approximately one half of the converted term loan principal balance outstanding as of april  will be payable in quarterly installments through august  with all remaining principal and interest due on august  the million revolving term borrowing facility provides for interest rates ranging from libor plus one percent to libor plus two and five eighths percent depending upon our total debt to capitalization ratio 
the facility is secured by certain fixed assets 
the million domestic revolving credit facilities provide for interest rates ranging from libor plus seven eighths percent to libor plus two and five eighths percent depending upon our total debt to capitalization ratio 
the million domestic revolving credit facilities  million of which was available for borrowings at october   are secured by domestic chicken inventories 
borrowings against these facilities are subject to the availability of eligible collateral and no material adverse change provisions 
we also maintain operating leases for various types of equipment  some of which contain residual value guarantees for the market value of assets at the end of the term of the lease 
the terms of the lease maturities range from one to seven years 
we estimate the maximum potential amount of the residual value guarantees is approximately million  however  the actual amount would be offset by any recoverable amount based on the fair market value of the underlying leased assets 
no liability has been recorded related to this contingency as the likelihood of payments under these guarantees is not considered to be probable and the fair value of the guarantees is immaterial 
we historically have not experienced significant payments under similar residual guarantees 
at october   our working capital increased to million and our current ratio increased to to  compared with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at october   primarily due to increased profitability of our operations and the working capital changes discussed below 
trade accounts and other receivables were million at october   compared to million at october  the million  or  decrease in trade accounts and other receivables was primarily due to changes in sales mix and increased collection activity 
inventories were million at october   compared to million at october  the million  or  decrease in inventories was primarily due to the reduction in turkey inventories in early fiscal resulting from the turkey restructuring and reduced product pricing in finished chicken products as a result of lower feed ingredient costs 
accounts payable decreased million to million at october   compared to million at october  the decrease was primarily due to lower feed ingredient costs 
accrued liabilities increased million or to million compared to million at october  this increase is due primarily to increases in our profit based retirement and compensation plans 
income taxes payable decreased million to million compared to million at october  due to significant tax deposits being made in the last month of fiscal cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to significant increase in our net income in fiscal the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to significant increase in our net income in fiscal cash flows provided by used in investing activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures excluding business acquisitions of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively  were primarily incurred to acquire and expand certain facilities  improve efficiencies  reduce costs and for the routine replacement of equipment 
we anticipate spending approximately million to million in fiscal to improve efficiencies and for the routine replacement of equipment at our current operations 
we expect to finance such expenditures with available cash and operating cash flows and existing revolving term and revolving credit facilities 
cash was also used in fiscal to purchase million of investment securities 
cash in fiscal of million was used for the fiscal acquisition 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to prior year borrowings to finance the fiscal acquisition offset somewhat by cash repayments of borrowings in cash was also provided by the proceeds from the sale of the company s stock  offset somewhat by the purchase of a like number of shares of the company s common stock owned by conagra foods 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to borrowings to finance the fiscal acquisition offset somewhat by cash repayments of borrowings 
we are a party to many routine contracts in which we provide general indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks 
among other considerations  we have not recorded a liability for any of these indemnities as based upon the likelihood of payment  the fair value of such indemnities is immaterial 
our loan agreements generally obligate us to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental increased costs due to a change in law that imposes i any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of  deposits with or credit extended by such lender related to the loan  ii any tax  duty or other charge with respect to the loan except standard income tax or iii capital adequacy requirements 
in addition  some of our loan agreements contain a withholding tax provision that requires us to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing party  generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law 
these increased cost and withholding tax provisions continue for the entire term of the applicable transaction  and there is no limitation on the maximum additional amounts we could be obligated to pay under such provisions 
any failure to pay amounts due under such provisions generally would trigger an event of default  and  in a secured financing transaction  would entitle the lender to foreclose upon the collateral to realize the amount due 
off balance sheet arrangements on june   the camp county industrial development corporation issued million of variable rate environmental facilities revenue bonds supported by letters of credit obtained by us 
we may draw from these proceeds over the construction period for new sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at a poultry by products plant to be built in camp county  texas 
we are not required to borrow the full amount of the proceeds from these revenue bonds 
all amounts borrowed from these funds will be due in the revenue bonds are supported by letters of credit obtained by us under our revolving credit facilities which are secured by our domestic chicken inventories 
the bonds will be recorded as debt of the company if and when they are spent to fund construction 
we maintain a receivables purchase agreement under which we can sell on a revolving basis up to million of certain trade receivables the pooled receivables to a special purpose corporation wholly owned by us  which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest to third parties 
this facility matures on june  at october  and at october  there were no pooled receivables sold 
as of october  the full amount of the facility was available 
contractual obligations and guarantees 
obligations under long term debt and non cancelable operating leases at october  were as follows in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt a guarantee fees operating leases purchase obligations total a excludes million in letters of credit outstanding related to normal business transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer programs and incentives  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes and product recall accounting 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized upon shipment and transfer of ownership of the product to the customer and is recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged back to net sales in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
inventory 
live poultry inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeder hens at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or market 
the costs associated with breeder hens are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over their productive lives using the unit of production method 
finished poultry products  feed  eggs and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we record valuations and adjustments for our inventory and for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting inventory obsolescence  including significantly aged products  discontinued product lines  or damaged or obsolete products 
we allocate meat costs between our various finished poultry products based on a by product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by product parts  primarily including leg quarters  wings  tenders and offal  which are carried in inventory at the estimated recovery amounts  with the remaining amount being reflected as our breast meat cost 
generally  the company performs an evaluation of whether any lower of cost or market adjustments are required based on a number of factors  including i pools of related inventory  ii product continuation or discontinuation  iii estimated market selling prices and iv expected distribution channels 
if actual market conditions or other factors are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
valuation of marketable securities 
the company s investments which are classified as available for sale are carried at market value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
these investments are classified as either a cash equivalent  current asset or long term asset based on their remaining time to maturity 
investments with a maturity date of one year or less from the balance sheet date are classified as a current asset and those with a maturity date of greater than one year are classified as long term asset 
the company s investments are considered available for sale as these securities could be sold at any time in response to needs for liquidity  changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative instruments or changes in funding sources or terms 
property  plant and equipment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
in making these determinations  the company utilizes certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i future cash flows estimates expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  remaining length of service and estimated salvage values ii estimated fair market value of the assets and iii determinations with respect to the lowest level of cash flows relevant to the respective impairment test  generally groupings of related operational facilities 
litigation and contingent liabilities 
the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  securities  environmental  product and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  including legal defense costs  if any  for these contingencies is made when losses are determined to be probable and reasonably estimatible and after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
these reserves may change in the future due to favorable or adverse judgments  changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
accrued self insurance 
insurance expense for casualty claims and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
certain categories of claim liabilities are actuarially determined 
the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management 
however  actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized 
purchase price accounting 
the company allocates the total purchase price in connection with acquisitions to assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values 
for property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill  for significant acquisitions  the company has historically relied upon the use of third party valuation experts to assist in the estimation of fair values 
historically  the carrying value of acquired accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable have approximated their fair value as of the date of acquisition  though adjustments are made within purchase price accounting to the extent needed to record such assets and liabilities at fair value 
with respect to accrued liabilities  the company uses all available information to make its best estimate of the fair value of the acquired liabilities and  when necessary  may rely upon the use of third party actuarial experts to assist in the estimation of fair value for certain liabilities  primarily self insurance accruals 
product recall accounting 
the company has a separate insurance contract for product recall coverage with an insurance company that specifically provides for reimbursement of direct recall related expenses  product restoration expenses and loss of business income 
the company records receivables related to direct recall related expense  specifically related to the write off of inventory  third party shipping and freight costs  payments made for outside labor  internal hourly labor  third party warehouse storage costs and payments to customers 
the company records receivables for only the readily  objectively determinable amounts of direct product recall costs reimbursable under its insurance policy 
the recoveries related to the business interruption and product re establishment portions of the insurance recoveries are recorded when realized  generally upon collection 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
taxes are provided for international subsidiaries based on the assumption that their earnings are indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries and as such deferred taxes are not provided for in us income taxes that would be required in the event of distribution of these earnings  except that we provide deferred taxes on the earnings of international subsidiaries that we intend to repatriate or otherwise deem are not indefinitely reinvested 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we review the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet  primarily operating loss carryforwards  based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels of the individual operations and provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
the company has reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  it nevertheless has established tax reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by the company resulting in additional liabilities for tax and interest 
the tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the company s potential liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits  additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues  release of administrative guidance  or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of feed ingredients  marketable equity security prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions our management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
feed ingredients 
we purchase certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal 
as a result  our earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
as market conditions dictate  we will from time to time lock in future feed ingredient prices using various hedging techniques  including forward purchase agreements with suppliers and futures contracts 
we do not use such financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the weighted average cost of our primary feed ingredients as of october  based on our feed consumption during fiscal  such an increase would have resulted in an increase to cost of sales of approximately million 
foreign currency 
our earnings are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the mexican peso net monetary position of our mexico subsidiaries 
we manage this exposure primarily by attempting to minimize our mexican peso net monetary position  but from time to time  we have also considered executing hedges to help minimize this exposure 
such instruments  however  have historically not been economically feasible 
we are also exposed to the effect of potential exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that amounts are repatriated from mexico to the us however  we currently anticipate that the majority of the cash flows of our mexico subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested in our mexico operations 
in addition  the mexican peso exchange rate can directly and indirectly impact our results of operations and financial position in several ways  including potential economic recession in mexico resulting from a devalued peso 
the impact on our financial position and results of operations resulting from a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso cannot be reasonably estimated 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses  representing the change in the us dollar value of the net monetary assets of our mexico subsidiaries denominated in mexican pesos  was a gain of million in fiscal  a loss of million in fiscal and a gain of million in fiscal on october   the mexican peso closed at to us dollar  compared to at october  no assurance can be given as to how future movements in the peso could affect our future earnings 
interest rates 
our earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt instruments
