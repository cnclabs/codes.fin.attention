item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please see risk factors 
overview essex provides advanced signal  image  and information processing solutions primarily for us government intelligence and defense customers 
we create our solutions by combining our services and expertise with hardware  software  and proprietary and patented technology to meet our customers requirements 
within the intelligence and defense communities we have established and maintained long standing and successful customer relationships 
we are also developing next generation signal  image and information processing solutions under classified us government research and development awards 
we have been able to develop our current proprietary technology using a combination of government funding and our own internal funding and we believe this combination will allow us to continue to enhance and expand our technology and services for future market needs 
most of our revenues are derived from awards with the us government  where we are either the prime contractor or a subcontractor  depending on the award 
for fiscal year ended december  and december   revenues derived from the us intelligence and defense communities and other departments and agencies of the department of defense were million  or  and million  or  of our total revenues  respectively 
on certain projects  our customers require us to purchase and provide the hardware which may also include software and firmware portion of the total system solution  which entails our purchasing hardware from third party vendors and reselling it to our customers 
we show the revenue and costs from purchased hardware separately since this revenue carries significantly lower margins than our products and services revenue 
the purchased hardware revenue is highly variable from quarter to quarter 

table of contents our most significant expenses are cost of goods sold and services provided  which consist primarily of direct labor and associated costs for program personnel and direct expenses incurred to complete projects  including the cost of materials and equipment and subcontract efforts 
our ability to accurately predict personnel requirements  salaries and other costs  as well as to manage personnel levels and utilize our personnel versus subcontracting the work  can have a significant impact on our cost of goods sold and services provided 
utilizing our own employees to complete projects results in higher gross margins as compared to our enlisting subcontracted employees for the same work 
as a result  we seek to maximize our internal labor content on our awards 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our management  facilities  finance and administrative groups and business development expenses which include bid and proposal efforts  and occupancy  travel and other corporate costs 
we have revenue from some awards on which our us government customers pay us to perform research and development on their behalf 
we also spend funds on internal research and development  which are separately classified as such in the financial statements 
we are in a net operating loss carry forward position 
on march   we acquired of the common stock of sensys development laboratories  inc  or sdl 
the assigned value of the consideration and related expenses was approximately million 
sdl provides both system and software engineering technical support to us government customers and prime contractors supporting government programs 
sdl has an established workforce with specialized experience and credentials 
for its fiscal year ended september   sdl had revenues of million 
on april   we acquired of the common stock of computer science innovations  inc  or csi  which is headquartered in melbourne  florida  for approximately million in cash 
csi has proprietary techniques  algorithms and tools that are used to build custom cognitive engines for a broad range of intelligence  defense and commercial customers and applications 
cognitive engines are software that includes predictive models and classifiers  and they have applications in the areas of fraud and anomaly detection  image and signal recognition  information integration  knowledge management  network information assurance  semantic processing and waveform analysis 
csi had revenue of approximately million in its fiscal year ended march  on june   we acquired substantially all of the assets of performance group  inc  or pgi  with main offices in fredericksburg  virginia  for approximately million in cash and  in assumed liabilities 
pgi provides services and systems in the areas of gis  image processing and analysis  spatial data development  environmental consulting  visualization  and it solutions to government and private sector clients 
pgi had revenue of approximately million in calendar year critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  research and development  intangible assets and 
table of contents contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into three types of us government agreements time and material 
on time and material agreements  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates multiplied by hours delivered  plus other direct costs 
cost plus fixed fee 
we recognize revenue on cost plus fixed fee arrangements to the extent costs are incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned 
we must determine that the costs incurred are proper and that the ultimate costs incurred will not overrun the expected funding on the project and still deliver the scope of work proposed 
even though cost plus fixed fee arrangements generally do not require that we expend costs in excess of the award value  such expenditures may be required in order to achieve customer satisfaction and receive additional work 
in addition  since the reimbursable costs include both direct and indirect costs  we must determine that the indirect costs are properly accounted and allocated in accordance with reasonable cost allocation methods 
fixed price 
on fixed price agreements  we must determine that the costs incurred provide a proportionate amount of progress on the work and that the ultimate costs incurred will not overrun the funding on the award and the required hours will be delivered 
we use historical technical performance experience where applicable to evaluate progress on fixed price and cost plus fixed fee jobs 
we use historical government audit experience in the indirect cost area to evaluate the propriety and expected recovery of our indirect costs on cost plus fixed fee agreements 
the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues under each type of contract for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  percentage of revenues by contract type fiscal year ended dec

 time and material cost plus fixed fee fixed price total 
table of contents costs of goods sold and services provided our costs are categorized as either direct or indirect costs 
direct costs are those that can be identified with and allocated to specific contracts and tasks 
they include labor  fringe for example  leave time  medical dental  retirement plan  payroll taxes  employee welfare  worker s compensation and other benefits  subcontractor costs  consultant fees  travel expenses  materials and equipment 
indirect costs are either overhead or general and administrative expenses 
indirect costs cannot generally be identified with specific contracts or tasks  and to the extent that they are allowable  they are allocated to contracts and tasks using appropriate government approved methodologies 
costs determined to be unallowable under the federal acquisition regulations cannot be allocated to projects 
our principal unallowable costs are interest expense  amortization expense for separately identified intangibles from acquisitions  certain general and administrative expenses  financing and merger acquisition costs 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
such costs include direct labor and materials as well as a reasonable allocation of overhead costs 
however  no general and administrative costs are included 
equipment which has alternative future uses is capitalized and charged to expense over its estimated useful life 
goodwill and other intangible assets business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
which requires that we  on an annual basis  calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units 
because of the integral technologies and operations of the acquisitions to date  we have determined that essex has only one corporate wide reporting entity to which this test applies 
income taxes as a result of cumulative tax losses in recent years along with the uncertainty of realizing tax loss carryforwards  we have recorded reserves against any tax benefit that may be derived should those carryforwards be realized through the recognition of taxable income in the future 
at december   our management assessed the reserves and determined that reversing those existing reserves was not warranted at this time 
that decision was primarily based on two factors 
first  we continue to experience significant book tax differences which our management believes should reduce taxable income substantially below income reported on the financial statements 
those differences include amortization of goodwill over fifteen years and the deduction associated with the exercise of employee stock options 
second  while we achieved both book and taxable profit in  we did not have sufficient future firm funded sales backlog see backlog under these management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at december  to ensure sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset 

table of contents business combination we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  whereby the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves significant estimates and management judgment that may be adjusted during the allocation period  but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date 
external costs incurred related to successful business combinations are capitalized as costs of business combinations  while internal costs incurred by us for acquisition opportunities are expensed 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with or through any unconsolidated entity or which have not been recognized and disclosed in these financial statements

our revenues were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the key factors for the higher revenue were the increased activity on the october million multi year award increased to million at year end and a january million increased in the third quarter of to million two year award for software and systems engineering and the delivery of custom systems to national priority programs 
revenues from these two awards in fiscal were million and million  respectively 
of this total of million  million was for purchased hardware

total cgs increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  total cgs was approximately for fiscal  compared to approximately for fiscal for services and products revenue  cgs was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in cgs in reflects increased volume and revenue for the period 
the increase in cgs as a percentage of revenue in reflects the change in the mix of work  primarily related to the two contracts awarded in october and january  discussed above 
specifically  upon award and ramp up  a majority of the revenues under those contracts relate to subcontracts and purchased hardware which are at a lower margin 
over time  we anticipate a gradual shift of a portion of this work to our staff

amortization of other intangible assets 
during fiscal  amortization of other intangible assets was  which was primarily related to the csi and pgi acquisitions 
there was  of amortization costs in the comparable period in relating to the sdl acquisition 
the remaining balance of  of other intangible assets was fully amortized during the first and second quarters of we had no amortization cost in fiscal net interest dividend income expense 
net interest dividend income was  in fiscal compared to net interest expense of  in the comparable period of the net interest income reflects the temporary investment of the proceeds from our and stock offerings

fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  revenues 
our revenues were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues in fiscal include million for ten months of operations from sdl  which we acquired in march excluding sdl  revenues in were million or million higher than due to several factors 
a key factor was the increased activity on the us government missile defense agency program for design of a next generation 
table of contents advanced optoelectronics radar processor  or aop  demonstration unit 
this program generated revenues of million in fiscal compared to revenues of million in as we did not begin this program until may our november million award contributed million of revenues in fiscal and  of revenues in fiscal additionally  in fiscal we sold million of products and equipment  including the sale of ten hyperfine wdm family devices  consisting of five prototype demultiplexers and five of the new flat top hyperfine wdm devices for use in building advanced optical code division multiple access systems  for  to several government and intermediate customers 
we had only  of such products and equipment sales in fiscal cost of goods sold and services provided 
our cost of goods sold and services provided increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of goods sold and services provided was approximately for fiscal  compared to approximately for fiscal in fiscal  due to the sdl acquisition and communications sales referenced previously  there was a significant increase in the direct labor and associated costs for work performed at our customers facilities 
we receive a lower markup on work performed at customer facilities 
overall  the higher volume during contributed a larger amount of gross profit  though at a lower gross profit percentage 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was due to increased business development and higher management costs in the government contracts area  and to the recurring costs of the acquired company related to its operations 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses declined by  to  for fiscal from million in fiscal we incurred the majority of our research and development expenses on efforts related to development of our optical communications technology 
amortization of other intangible assets 
during fiscal  amortization of other intangible assets was  all of which was related to the sdl acquisition 
the remaining balance of  of other intangible assets was fully amortized during the first and second quarters of we had no amortization cost in fiscal net interest expense 
net interest expense was  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in net interest expense reflects an increase in our debt and costs related to our accounts receivable facility prior to the completion of our follow on public offering in mid december net income loss 
net income was  and net loss was million in fiscal and  respectively 
we are in a net operating loss carry forward position for book and tax purposes 
our provision for income taxes in was zero due to our net operating loss carryforwards 
backlog our awards with the us government generally extend over multiple years 
funded backlog generally consists of the sum of all awards amounts of work for which funding has been 
table of contents approved and awards granted  less the value of work performed under such awards 
since the us government operates under annual appropriations  our customers typically fund awards on an incremental basis  generally for periods of one year or less 
in many cases  our awards include unexercised options 
accordingly  a significant amount of our backlog is unfunded 
we include in unfunded backlog the total value of signed contracts  less funding to date 
unfunded backlog includes awards options based upon expected performance levels for those options 
unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential delivery orders that might be awarded under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts 
we have recently revised our definition of unfunded backlog and the amounts presented are consistent with this new definition 
the effect of our change reduced backlog by million at december  as of december   we had total backlog  funded and unfunded  of million as compared with million at december  of these amounts  funded backlog was million and unfunded backlog was million at fiscal year end compared to million and million  respectively  at fiscal year end unfunded backlog as of december  includes the remaining balance of million on our million  ten year award through to provide communications systems support to the intelligence community 
unfunded backlog at december  also includes the remaining balance of million on our million multi year award in which the ceiling was significantly increased from its original million october award in december for software and systems engineering 
we currently expect to recognize revenue during fiscal year from approximately of our total backlog as of december  net operating loss carry forward we are in a net operating loss nol carry forward position 
no provision or benefit from federal income taxes was recognized in fiscal years  or the nol and other tax credits can be used to offset future taxable income and taxes payable  except for those states where our nol is not available 
we recognized  in state tax expense in liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance the costs of our operations and to make capital expenditures and acquisitions 
based upon our current level of operations  we expect that our cash flow from operations and amounts of cash on hand will be adequate to meet our anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months 
a significant part of our business strategy is to pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions and we used a substantial portion of our cash balance at fiscal year end for the acquisition of the windermere group  llc 
during fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities was million  a significant improvement from and where cash used in operations was  and million  respectively 
cash provided in fiscal year was from net income and non cash depreciation  amortization and other charges of approximately million and a decrease of  in accounts payable and accrued items net of the change in accounts receivable and prepaids 
an increase in accounts receivable during was due to the increase in sales and does not reflect any significant change in payment cycle 

table of contents during fiscal year  net cash used in investing activities was million  of which million was for the acquisitions of csi and substantially all of the assets of pgi 
we also expended million for property  equipment and leasehold improvements to support our growing work force 
our working capital at december  increased to million from million at fiscal year end the increase was primarily a result of the proceeds from our public offering of common stock in during fiscal year  net cash provided by financing activities was million 
cash received of million from the sale of common stock and proceeds from exercises of stock options was offset by cash of million that was provided to a landlord under an obligation to finance special facility security improvements as described below in contractual obligations and commitments 
inflation because of the company s substantial activities in professional services and product development  the company is more labor intensive than firms involved primarily in industrial activities 
to attract and maintain higher caliber professional staff  the company must structure its compensation programs competitively 
the wage demand effect of inflation is felt almost immediately in the company s costs  however  the net effect during the periods presented is minimal 
the inflation rate in the united states generally has little impact on the company s cost reimbursable type contracts and other short term contracts 
for longer term  fixed price and time and material type contracts  the company endeavors to protect its margins by including cost escalation provisions or other specific inflation protective terms in these contracts 
the preceding paragraphs discussing the company s financial condition contain forward looking statements 
the factors affecting the ability of the company to meet its funding requirements and manage its cash resources include  among other things  the amount and timing of product sales  inventory turnover  the magnitude of fixed costs  sales growth and the ability to obtain working capital  all of which involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
contractual obligations and commitments contractual cash obligations the following table shows our contractual cash obligations due in each of fiscal through we have no contractual cash obligations due after operating leases capital leases  including interest total 
table of contents the company entered into leases for production and office space in maryland in connection with the work on its largest program 
the leases are for seven years ending approximately april and total rent is approximately million 
the leases contain normal clauses for payment of operating  real estate and common area maintenance over base year amounts and provide for a one time option to terminate the leases after years from the commencement date of the respective lease 
in connection with these leases  the company agreed to provide an estimated million to the landlord to finance special security related leasehold improvements 
the company has recorded a note receivable in connection with the lease as the landlord will repay the funds over thirty nine months following construction completion at interest 
at december   the company had funded million of this commitment 
the company has entered into a lease for replacement office space for certain of its maryland operations  including its corporate headquarters 
the lease is for a term of seven years beginning in approximately april and total rent is approximately million 
the leases contain normal clauses for payment of operating  real estate and common area maintenance over base year amounts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company has no variable rate debt outstanding as of december  our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates on short term investment of the remaining proceeds of our stock offerings 
presently  such investments earn approximately 
based upon our investments for fiscal  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have increased or decreased income by  for every million invested and would have increased or decreased our annual cash flow and interest income by a comparable amount 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be valued at fair value on the grant date and be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
sfas no 
r is effective for the company on july  the company will transition to sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application 
under the modified prospective application  compensation costs will be recognized in the financial statements for all new share based payments granted after july  additionally  the company will recognize compensation costs for the portion of previously granted awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered nonvested awards that are outstanding as of july  over the remaining requisite service period of the awards 
the compensation expense to be recognized for the nonvested awards will be based on the fair value of the awards 
we are currently 
table of contents evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our financial position and results of operations  and it is possible that our adoption of this standard may adversely affect our operational results in future periods 
at december   the total valuation of options issued and vesting after july  is expected to be  with  vesting in the year ending december
