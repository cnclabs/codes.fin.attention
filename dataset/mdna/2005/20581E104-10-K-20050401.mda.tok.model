table of contents 
index to financial statements introduction we are a leading information technology  or it  staffing services company that provides a full range of specialized staffing and project implementation services and products 
the staffing services we provide allow our clients to focus their resources on their core businesses rather than on recruiting  training and managing it professionals 
in using our staffing services  our clients benefit from our extensive recruiting channels  providing our clients ready access to highly skilled it professionals  often within hours of submitting a placement request  access to a flexible workforce  allowing our clients to manage their labor costs more effectively without compromising their it goals  and our knowledge of the market for it resources  providing our clients with qualified candidates at competitive prices 
we contract with our customers to provide both short and long term it staffing services at client locations throughout the us our consultants possess a wide range of skills and experience  including website development and integration  application programming and development  client server development  systems software architecture and design  systems engineering and systems integration 
our it staffing services accounted for approximately of our revenues for  of our revenues for and of our revenues for in addition to our core it staffing business  we also offer our customers services that complement our staffing activities  such as vendor management  in which we assist our clients in quantifying  rationalizing and monitoring their procurement of temporary staffing and other services from multiple suppliers  project solutions  including software development and maintenance  network design and management and offshore application maintenance and development  and recruitment and permanent placement of it professionals 
these additional services provide us opportunities to build relationships with new clients and enhance our service offerings to our existing clients 
overview our business strategy is to become the leading provider of it staffing services in the united states 
among our immediate peer group  we are the only staffing provider focused exclusively on the it sector 
we intend to continue implementing our business strategy through a combination of internal growth and strategic acquisitions that complement or enhance our business 
industry trends that affect our business include rate of technological change  rate of growth in corporate it budgets  penetration of it staffing in the general workforce  outsourcing of the it workforce  and consolidation of supplier bases 
beginning in the second half of  the overall growth of the united states economy began to slow 
while this slowdown negatively affected most industry segments  its greatest impact was on the telecommunications 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and internet sectors 
the combination of the slowdown in the economy  which also resulted in business failures  and the uncertainty as to when an economic recovery would take place led many companies to postpone or cancel it projects 
as a result  our business declined as evidenced by a reduction in billable consultants from january through june during the economic downturn  we took steps to strengthen our operations and better position us to grow our business 
the steps we took included diversifying our client base  implementing consistent business practices across our organization and improving our front office and back office infrastructure 
we believe that a continuation of the recent economic recovery will drive a renewed need for it investments and initiatives by corporate clients 
we expect this increase in it spending  combined with the need to maintain financial flexibility by using variable workforce strategies  to result in increased demand for our services 
since the beginning of the third quarter of  headcount numbers have been trending upward  reflecting an increase in the commencement of new projects and a decline in project postponements and cancellations 
our billable consultant headcount increased from approximately  for old comsys at june  to approximately  for old comsys prior to the merger on september  to  for our operations at january  we expect consultant headcount to increase through we anticipate that our growth will be primarily generated from greater penetration of our service offerings with our current clients  introducing new service offerings to our customers and obtaining new clients 
our strategy for achieving this growth includes expanding our geographic presence  cross selling our vms and project solutions services to existing it staffing customers  aggressively marketing our services to new clients  expanding our range of value added services  enhancing brand recognition and making strategic acquisitions 
the success of our business depends primarily on the volume of assignments we secure  the bill rates for those assignments  the costs of the consultants that provide the services and the quality and efficiency of our recruiting  sales and marketing and administrative functions 
our brand name  our proven track record  our recruiting and candidate screening processes  our strong account management team and our efficient and consistent administrative processes are factors that we believe are key to the success of our business 
factors outside of our control  such as the demand for it services  general economic conditions and the supply of qualified it professionals  will also affect our success 
our revenue is primarily driven by bill rates and billable hours 
most of our billings for our staffing and project solutions services are on a time and materials basis  which means that we bill our customers based on pre agreed bill rates for the number of hours that each of our consultants works on an assignment 
we also generate fee income by providing vendor management and permanent placement services 
hourly bill rates are typically determined based on the level of skill and experience of the consultants assigned and the supply and demand in the current market for those qualifications 
general economic conditions  macro it expenditure trends and competition may create pressure on our pricing 
increasingly  large customers  including those with preferred supplier arrangements  have been seeking pricing discounts in exchange for higher volumes of business 
billable hours are affected by numerous factors  such as the quality and scope of our service offerings and competition at the national and local levels 
our principal operating expenses are cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of services is comprised primarily of the costs of consultant labor  including employees  subcontractors and independent contractors  and related employee benefits 
approximately of our consultants are employees  and the remainder are subcontractors and independent contractors 
we compensate most of our consultants only for the hours that we bill to our clients  which allows us to better match our labor costs with our revenue generation 
with respect to our consultant employees  we are responsible for employment related taxes  medical and health care costs  and workers compensation 
labor costs are sensitive to shifts in the supply and demand of it professionals  as well as increases in the costs of benefits and taxes 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the principal components of selling  general and administrative expenses are salaries  selling commissions  advertising  lead generation and other marketing costs and branch office expenses 
our branch office network allows us to leverage certain selling  general and administrative expenses  such as advertising and back office functions 
our infrastructure includes a shared services operation in phoenix  arizona for our back office functions  including payroll  billing  accounts payable  collections and financial reporting 
this single site  shared services operation is the platform for providing high quality service to our customers and enables us to integrate acquisitions rapidly while reducing corporate overhead and other expenses 
we also have a proprietary  web enabled front office system fox that facilitates the identification  qualification and placement of consultants in a timely manner 
we also maintain a national recruiting center  a centralized call center for setting sales appointments and a centralized proposals and contract services department 
we expect that this scalable infrastructure will facilitate our internal growth strategy and allow us to integrate acquisitions rapidly 
the merger on september   old comsys completed a merger transaction with venturi  a publicly traded it and commercial staffing company  in which comsys holding  inc was merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of venturi 
concurrent with the merger  we sold venturi s commercial staffing business for million in cash and the assumption of approximately  in liabilities 
at the effective time of the merger  we changed our name to comsys it partners  inc and issued new shares of our common stock to the stockholders of old comsys  resulting in such stockholders owning approximately of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
since former old comsys stockholders owned a majority of our outstanding common stock as a result of the merger  old comsys is deemed the acquiring company for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
the key elements of the integration of the legacy businesses of old comsys and venturi have been completed on or ahead of the original schedule 
we believe this diminishes the business risks associated with the integration and accelerates the recognition of cost savings 
further  we have created a corporate infrastructure capable of supporting our internal growth strategy and future acquisitions 
during the few months since the merger was completed  we have made substantial progress toward the integration of the businesses of old comsys and venturi  including consolidation of all duplicate branch offices  deployment of our proprietary front office information system fox to the venturi branch offices  standardization of compensation plans for all account managers  recruiters and managing directors  implementation of common health care and k programs  transition of the old comsys back office information system to venturi s peoplesoft system and transition of legacy venturi back office and accounting processes to our shared services operation located in phoenix  arizona  together resulting in the consolidation of all of our back office operations for comsys  including payroll  billing  accounts payable  collections and financial reporting  and elimination of approximately duplicative staff positions  with another positions to be eliminated in the first quarter of

in addition  vendor management related fee revenue for old comsys increased from million in to million in due to the expansion and implementation of vendor management programs in response to increasing demand for such programs among major companies 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease in old comsys average bill rate  which was per hour in compared to per hour in the prior year

as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to excluding the million credit to bad debt expense in the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due to our ability to leverage fixed overhead costs over an expanding revenue base

revenues for were million  a decline of million  or  from revenues of million 
this decline in revenue was primarily the result of old comsys customers deferring or canceling it projects due to the general slowdown in the united states economy which continued through the first half of billable headcount decreased from  at december  to  at june  in the second half of  billable headcount increased to  by the end of the year

cost of services for and amounted to million and million  respectively 
cost of services consists primarily of the cost of labor and related benefits  and the year over year decrease was due to the decline in billable headcount  as described above 
cost of services as a percentage of revenues in was  a slight increase from in the downward bill rate and margin pressures experienced during the economic downturn began to ease in the second half of as economic conditions improved 
in addition  old comsys has been able to minimize the impact of pricing pressure by successfully passing pricing concessions on to subcontractors and certain consultants employed by old comsys 
as a result  cost of services as a percentage of revenues in was relatively unchanged on a year over year basis 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for and amounted to million and million  respectively

under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
remaining intangibles with finite useful lives continue to be amortized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 assembled workforce intangibles of old comsys are combined with goodwill in the consolidated balance sheets 
upon adopting sfas no 
 old comsys performed an initial test of impairment on goodwill effective january   which resulted in the recording of an impairment loss amounting to million 
this loss is presented as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations 
old comsys operating profits and cash flows were lower than expected in the second half of due to the continued economic downturn in the united states  which caused many of its clients to cancel or postpone it initiatives 
old comsys management revised its earnings forecast for the subsequent five years based on then current trends  resulting in an additional goodwill impairment loss of million being recorded in the fourth quarter of this impairment loss is presented in the consolidated statement of operations as part of operating costs and expenses 
the fair value of goodwill was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows and market multiples 
old comsys performed its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and determined that there was no additional impairment at that time 
depreciation and amortization 
for and  depreciation and amortization expense amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase from to was due to increases in depreciation expense and amortization of contract cost intangibles

sfas no 
applies to old comsys redeemable preferred stock and  as a result  interest expense for includes dividends  amortization of deferred stock issuance costs and an increase in the common stock warrant liability in the aggregate amount of million 
the remaining increase in interest expense was due to scheduled increases in the interest rate on the senior subordinated notes and the compounding effect of accrued interest not paid in cash

liquidity and capital resources overview old comsys has historically financed its operations through internally generated funds  the issuance of preferred stock and borrowings under its credit facilities 
at january   we had net positive working capital of million compared to a net working capital deficit for old comsys of million at december  the deficit was primarily due to the current portion of long term debt and interest payable  which were million and million  respectively  at december  as of december   old comsys classified its borrowings of million under the old comsys credit facility and million under a deferred interest note issued in september as current because these instruments were due to mature in september

the proceeds from this credit facility were used to repay in full the current maturities of long term debt outstanding on that date  including borrowings under the old comsys credit facility and the deferred interest note  and to pay million of accrued interest payable on senior subordinated debt 
on september   in conjunction with the merger with venturi  we issued million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and entered into a new senior credit facility with merrill lynch capital and a syndicate of lenders the senior credit agreement that replaced the agreement entered into on august  the senior credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to million under a revolving line of credit the revolver and a million term loan payable in eight quarterly installments the senior term loan

interest on the revolver and senior term loan is based on libor plus a margin  which on the revolver is or  depending upon our ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda  as defined in the senior credit agreement  and which is for the senior term loan 
at our election  interest on the revolver and senior term loan may be based on the prime rate plus a margin  which on the revolver is or  depending upon our ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda  and which is for the senior term loan 
the senior credit agreement is secured by a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries and a lien on the assets of our subsidiaries and expires in september at january   we had outstanding borrowings of million under the revolver at interest rates ranging from to per annum weighted average rate of and borrowing availability under the revolver of million for general corporate purposes and an additional million for merger integration costs 
the principal balance of the senior term loan on that date was million with tranches bearing interest rates ranging from to per annum weighted average rate of 
we anticipate that our borrowing availability for general corporate purposes under the revolver will be approximately million at the end of the first quarter of this reduction is due to delayed billings to customers that occurred in february as a result of the transition of the old comsys back office functions to venturi s peoplesoft system

interest on borrowings under these facilities is based on the prime rate or libor plus a variable margin

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates include the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  the recoverability of goodwill  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves for medical costs and realization of deferred tax assets 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our operations and include the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue under time and materials contracts is recorded at the time services are performed 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized using the units of production method based on the ratio of time incurred to total estimated time to complete the project 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recorded in the period the losses are determinable 
estimated losses on incomplete projects are determined by comparing the revenue remaining to be recognized on fixed price contracts to judgments as to estimated time and cost required to complete the project 
if the estimated cost to complete the project exceeds the remaining revenue to be recognized  the excess cost is recorded as a loss provision on the contract 
we report revenues from vendor management services net of the related pass through labor costs 
we also report revenues net of payrolling activity 
payrolling is defined as a situation in which we accept a client identified it consultant for payroll processing in exchange for a fee 
revenue generated by payrollees is recorded net of labor costs 
in our permanent placement business  we recognize revenue when employment candidates accept offers of permanent employment 
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets effective at the beginning of  old comsys adopted sfas  which established a new method for testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment using a fair value based approach 
under the new standard  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized as was previously required  but are tested annually for impairment  unless an event occurs or circumstances change during the year that reduce or may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value  in which event an impairment charge may be required during the year 
the annual test requires estimates and judgments by management to determine valuations for each reporting unit 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
different assumptions related to future cash flows  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates could result in an impairment charge  which would be recognized as a non cash charge to operating income and a reduction in asset values on its balance sheet 
at january   total goodwill was million 
at december  and  total goodwill was million 
our intangible assets other than goodwill represent contract costs and a customer base and are amortized over the respective contract terms or estimated life of the customer base  ranging from two to five years 
at january   december  and december   net intangible assets were million  million and million  respectively 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate intangibles or other long lived assets may be impaired  we evaluate the recoverability and estimated useful lives of such assets 
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets are compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a write down to market is necessary 
we believe that all of our long lived assets are fully realizable as of january  
table of contents 
index to financial statements collectibility of accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
further  we monitor current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
additional allowances may be required if the economy or the financial condition of our customers deteriorates 
if we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
as of january   december  and december   the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was million  million and million  respectively 
income tax assets and liabilities we record an income tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized 
these deferred tax items represent expenses or operating losses recognized for financial reporting purposes  which will result in tax deductions over varying future periods 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates that may affect the amount of the valuation allowance include estimates of future taxable income  availability of capital gains in future periods  timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and other tax planning strategies that may be available to us 
we record an estimated tax liability or tax benefit for income and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we use our best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent upon various matters  including resolution of tax audits  and may differ from amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded as a provision or benefit to income tax expense in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r will require us to  among other things  measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of sfas r are effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   therefore  we will adopt the new requirements no later than the beginning of our third quarter of fiscal adoption of the expensing requirements may reduce our reported earnings 
management is currently evaluating the specific impacts of adoption  which include whether we should adopt the requirements on a retrospective basis and which valuation model is most appropriate

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires an issuer to classify financial instruments that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the

stockholder notes receivable for the purchase of redeemable securities were reclassified from equity to noncurrent assets 
additionally  old comsys reclassified million of unamortized issuance costs associated with the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  which was previously netted against the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  to other assets 
effective july   old comsys also began to recognize dividends declared and the amortization of the deferred issuance costs associated with the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as interest expense
