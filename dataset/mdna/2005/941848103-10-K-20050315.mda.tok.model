the amount was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and which had no alternative future uses 
as of the creon acquisition date the acquisition date  there were four projects that met the above criteria 
the 
table of contents significant ipr d projects identified consist of the elab notebook and the automatic lc ms dereplication system 
the ipr d charges associated with these projects were million and million  respectively 
management determined the valuation of the ipr d using a number of factors  including engaging a third party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal 
the value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method 
this valuation included consideration of i the stage of completion of each of the projects  ii the technological feasibility of each of the projects  iii whether the projects had an alternative future use  and iv the estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was whether the product met predetermined design specifications and complex functionality 
as of the acquisition date  none of the ipr d projects had reached predetermined design specifications and complex functionality 
in assessing the technological feasibility of a project  consideration was also given to the level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each project had to overcome 
future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon management s estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the various products and technologies involved 
these projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account management s estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion 
the discount rates include a rate of return  which accounts for the time value of money  as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized 
the cash flows were discounted at discount rates ranging from to per annum  depending on the project s stage of completion and the type of complex functionality needed 
this discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects included in the purchased ipr d resulted in a total valuation of million 
although work on the projects related to the ipr d continued after the acquisition  the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d was written off because the projects underlying the ipr d that was being developed were not considered technologically feasible as of the acquisition date 
as of december   the ipr d automatic lc ms dereplication system project still had not reached technological feasibility 
the expected remaining cost to complete this project is not considered material to the company and there are currently no expected material variations between projected results from the projects versus those at the time of the acquisition 
the company expects the project to be completed within the next twelve months

on an on going basis  the company evaluates its policies and estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service  respectively 
partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
once the product is shipped  all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order 
the company s products generally carry one year of warranty 
these costs are accrued at the point of shipment 
once the warranty period has expired  the customer may purchase a service contract 
service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term  and revenue is amortized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
at december   the company had current and long term deferred revenue liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
product shipments  including those for demonstration or evaluation  and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices 
revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured 
the company s method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred 
table of contents when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete 
the company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors  including hourly service billing rates  estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties 
the company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort 
loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit 
the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  past transaction history with the customer  the credit worthiness of the customer  industry trends and the macro economic environment 
sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million 
historically  the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses 
the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis fifo 
the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence  historical demand  projections of future demand including that in the company s current backlog of orders  and industry and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
the company s inventory balance at december  was million  net of write downs to net realizable value of million 
valuation of equity investments the company holds minority equity interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
for investments where a company is not publicly traded  the company obtains and reviews quarterly and annual financial statements and progress of technological expectations 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in and  the company recorded million and million charges to other expense  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations  for the impairment of certain equity investments 
at december   the company had equity investments totaling million included in other assets on the balance sheet 
long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the company s capitalized patent  trademark and intellectual properties such as licenses 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  it measures 
table of contents any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
in  the company recorded a million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology licenses with sandia national laboratories as a significant portion of the technology collaboration program was suspended 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million  million  and million  respectively  as of december  the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill 
the company performed its annual review during and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
warranty product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s previous estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
at december   the company s warranty liability was million 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization  and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
the company has realized significant income tax benefits associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options 
the corresponding credit was to additional paid in capital 
because of the outstanding stock options  the company believes that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets will not be realized 
therefore  a valuation allowance has reduced to zero all the deferred tax assets relating to us income 
in the future event there is us taxable income  the valuation allowance would be reversed and deferred tax assets recorded with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital 
litigation as described in item of part i of this form k  the company is a party to various pending litigation matters 
with respect to each pending claim  management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and  if so  the probable range of that loss 
if and when management has determined  with respect to a particular claim  both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss  the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss 
the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 
with respect to the claims referenced in item  management of the company to date has been able to make this determination  and thus has recorded charges  with respect to the claims described under the heading hewlett packard company 
as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available  management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range  which may result in its recording charges or additional charges  which could materially impact the company s results of operation or financial position 

table of contents pension and other post retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other post retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually 
the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits  and changes as long term interest rates change 
at year end  the company determined this rate to be

in october  the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca contains a series of provisions  several of which are pertinent to the company 
the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us multi national corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
it has been the company s practice to permanently reinvest all foreign earnings into foreign operations and the company currently still plans to continue to reinvest foreign earnings permanently into its foreign operations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions of the ajca 
as such  the company is not yet in a position to decide on whether  and to what extent  the company might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us should the company determine that it plans to repatriate any foreign earnings  it will be required to establish an income tax expense and related tax liability on such earnings

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings  cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments  for purposes other than trading  in accordance with the company s overall risk management guidelines 
further information regarding the company s accounting policies for financial instruments and disclosures of financial instruments can be found in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances  forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in euro  japanese yen and british pound 
the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances 
in addition  the company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate 
at times  to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps  in which the company agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 
cash flow hedges the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt 
during the first quarter of  the company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt  with a maturity date of months 
the company subsequently closed out the swap in the second quarter of  with a realized gain of million 
the total pre tax amount of the gain that was re classified to earnings in was million 
the remaining million will be re classified to earnings in over the original term of the interest rate swap 
as of december   the company had no outstanding cash flow hedges 
hedges of net investments in foreign operations the company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world  with approximately of its sales denominated in euros  in yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies

the company uses cross currency interest rate swaps  forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations 
any increase or decrease in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swap agreements  forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the company s consolidated foreign affiliates 
therefore  these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the company 
during  the company hedged its net investment in yen foreign affiliates with cross currency interest rate swaps  with notional values ranging from approximately million to approximately million 
at december  and  the notional amounts of outstanding contracts were approximately million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company recorded cumulative net pre tax losses of million in accumulated other comprehensive income  which consisted of realized losses 
table of contents of million relating to closed cross currency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized losses of million relating to the japanese yen cross currency interest rate swap agreements

during  the company hedged its net investment in british pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in british pounds 
under the terms of the agreement the company purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell british pounds  and sells an option to their counterparties above the current spot rate to buy british pounds  with option premiums that offset 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a realized cumulative net pre tax loss of million to accumulated other comprehensive income  related to the closed range forward agreements 
as of december   the company had no open range forward agreements in british pounds 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of in year end exchange rates a weakening of the us dollar  the fair market value of the cross currency interest rate swap and foreign exchange contracts agreements  designated as hedges of net investment in foreign operations  as of december   would decrease accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately million 
other the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts  principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances 
principal hedged currencies include the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in inter company balances 
gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
at december  and december   the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of in year end exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar  the fair market value of the forward contracts  designated as fair value hedges  as of december  would decrease earnings by approximately million 
the company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations 
the company s cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments  with original maturities of days or less  in repurchase agreements and money market funds 
cash equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in value 
the company periodically maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits
