risk factors major news events events which dominate news broadcasts  such as the events of september th or the involvement by the united states in a war  may cause the company s clients to delay or not use the company s services for a particular project as such clients may determine that their messages may not receive adequate attention in light of the coverage of other news events 
such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
susceptibility to general economic conditions the company s revenues are affected by its clients marketing communications spending and advertising budgets 
the company s revenues and results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions in the geographic locations where it offers its services or distributes its material 
if there were to be continued economic downturn or a continued recession in these geographic locations  then the company expects that business enterprises  including its clients and potential clients  could substantially and immediately reduce their marketing and communications budgets 
in the event of such an economic climate  there would be a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
receptiveness of the media to our services  changes in our marketplace the company is the leading provider of creative and distribution services to corporations and other organizations seeking to communicate with the public through the news media 
if the marketplace for our services should change or if the news media  as a result of recent events or a perceived reduction in the value of our services or otherwise  should not be as receptive to our services or shall decide to reduce or eliminate its use of the news that the company distributes  there would be a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued competition the markets for the company s services are highly competitive 
the principal competitive factors affecting the company are effectiveness  reliability  price  technological sophistication and timeliness 
numerous specialty companies compete with the company in each of its service lines although no single company competes across all service lines 
some of the company s competitors or potential competitors have longer operating histories  longer client relationships and significantly greater financial  management  technological  sales  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  clients could perform internally all or certain of the services provided by the company rather than outsourcing such services 
the company could face competition from companies in related communications markets which could offer services that are similar or superior to those offered by the company 
in addition  national and regional telecommunications providers could enter the market with materially lower electronic delivery costs  and radio and television networks could also begin transmitting business communications separate from their news programming 
the company s ability to maintain and attract clients depends to a significant degree on the quality of services provided and its reputation among its clients and potential clients as compared to that of its competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will not face increased competition in the future or that such competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
new services the company must develop new services to remain competitive  maintain or grow market share and to operate in new markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new services  or that those new services will meet customer needs 
as a result of the expenses incurred in developing new services and the potential inability of the company to market these services successfully  the company s operating results may be negatively affected 
provisions of our charter documents may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
capital requirements one or more of our businesses could require  or benefit from  additional investment beyond our current capability 
such additional funding could be raised by the company  or one or more of its business units separately  and could have the effect of diluting shareholders interests 
other risk factors other risk factors include our recent history of losses  our ability to achieve or maintain profitability  effectiveness of our cost reduction programs  our ability to develop new services and market acceptance of such services  such as teletrax  our ability to develop new products and services that keep pace with technology  our ability to develop and maintain successful relationships with critical vendors  the potential negative effects of our international operations on the company 
in addition  future acquisitions or divestitures and the absence of long term contracts with customers and vendors may adversely effect our operations and have an adverse effect on pricing  revenues  gross margins and our customer base 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as significant to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the company s form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition revenue earned from the distribution and monitoring of video news releases and the distribution of printed news releases is recognized in the period that the release is distributed 
fees earned for webcasts  satellite media tours and other live events and the production of video news releases and still photographs are recognized in the period that the services are performed 
fees earned from teletrax are recognized ratably over the period of service 
fees earned from research services are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
invoices to clients are generated in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract  which may not be directly related to the performance of services 
unbilled receivables are invoiced based upon the achievement of specific events as defined by each agreement including deliverables  timetables and incurrence of certain costs 
unbilled receivables are classified as a current asset 
advanced billings to clients in excess of revenue earned are recorded as deferred revenues and are classified as a current liability 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers 
the company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
the company also records an allowance for all other accounts receivable balances based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts  customer concentrations  the general economic environment  and the aging of such receivables 
for the year ended december  revenue from no single client amounted to greater than of the company s consolidated revenues  however  for the year ended december   of the company s consolidated revenues were from one client 
if there were a deterioration of this major customer s financial condition  if the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of this major customer  or if future actual default rates on trade receivables  in general  differ from those currently anticipated  the company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas  the company reviews property and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds their fair market value 
although the company has recognized no impairment adjustments related to its property and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years  deterioration in the company s business or revenue from one of its service offerings in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods in which such business issues are identified 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we review the carrying value of our goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values 
in accordance with paragraph of sfas  medialink has aggregated certain components to arrive at one of its reporting units because they are similar in a the nature of the products and services provided  b the similar nature of the processes required to provide these services  c the similar nature of their customers and d their similar economic characteristics  being the purchase of third party services  salary costs and selling  general and administrative costs 
furthermore it is medialink s strategy to leverage the services provided by each component across the other components 
we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment 
when determining fair value  we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions  including projections of revenues  based on assumed long term growth rates  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates 
our estimates of long term growth and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and a variety of external sources  and are developed as part of our routine long range planning process 
based on the company s estimates as of september  there was no impairment of goodwill  however  changes in various circumstances including changes in the company s forecasts or changes in the company s internal business structure could cause one or more of the company s reporting units to be valued differently  thereby causing an impairment of goodwill 
we had approximately million of goodwill as of december  given the significance of our goodwill  an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge  which could be material to our consolidated earnings 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we considered all of the available evidence to arrive at our position on the net deferred tax assets  however  should circumstances change which would alter our judgment in this regard it may have an impact on future operating results 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued effects of newly issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period commencing after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt sfas r in its third quarter of fiscal under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the company is evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expects that the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
the company has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r 
inflation inflation has not had  nor does the company anticipate it having  a significant impact on the company s current and future operations
