item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview supertex designs  develops  manufactures  and markets high voltage analog and mixed signal integrated circuits utilizing state of the art high voltage dmos  hvcmos and hvbicmos analog and mixed signal technologies 
we supply standard and custom interface products primarily for the use in the telecommunications  imaging  and medical electronics markets 
we also provide custom processing services for the manufacture of integrated circuits for customers using customer owned designs and mask toolings 
factors which may affect operating results semiconductor companies as a group are subject to many similar risks 
these include the risks that the demand for semiconductors decreases as the industry has historically been very cyclical  there are shortages of raw materials and or fab capacity  or there are changes in underlying circuit or process technology or fab technology 
other factors that could affect our future results include whether we can generate new bookings from both new and current products  general economic conditions  both in the united states and foreign markets  and economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  risks associated with customer concentration  our ability to introduce new products  to enhance existing products  and to meet the continually changing requirements of our customers  our ability to maintain and enhance relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors and independent distributors and sales representatives  and whether we can manufacture efficiently and control costs 
in addition  we are subject to the risks described below  which are specific to our business we have focused our product offerings primarily on niche markets which leverage our capabilities and in which we believe we have dominance 
we attempt to choose markets which are sizable enough to be worth pursuing but which are not large enough to attract fierce competition 
these markets could grow enough to attract increased competition or else competitors could enter due to happenstance or downturns elsewhere 
in addition  these niches might be more susceptible to shrinkage than more diverse markets  due to their concentration on a few product offerings 
we work with our customers to develop products  which they will design into their systems 
even if we do achieve a design win  the customer s system may never go into production or the production may be smaller than we had anticipated 
although we attempt to develop products which will be useful for multiple customers  we may misjudge the market and develop a product which maybe useful for very few customers 
we are dependent upon one fab which we own and operate 
we would be susceptible were this fab to be unable to meet our needs  for example  were this fab to become obsolete due to process technology changes  or to be damaged  for example by fire or earthquake 
we could encounter difficulties in operating our fab  such as contaminants in the air or defects in equipment  which could affect yields and production 
we have several competitors which are substantially larger and could bring to bear substantially more resources in our niche markets 
we have been able to maintain profitable margins in part because of our dominance of most of our niche markets 
increased competition could cause our margins to decrease 
henry pao  a director of and the president and ceo of the company  along with mr 
pao s father and brother  collectively own greater than of our outstanding stock 
they have no agreement among themselves to act together with respect to the company or their stockholdings 
however  were they to act in concert  they would be our largest beneficial shareholder and would have an ability to elect one or more directors  to direct management  and to delay or prevent a change in control 
we sell a substantial amount of our products internationally 
we also package and test most of our products abroad 
problems with foreign economies  political turmoil  wars  changes in the exchange rate  or epidemics  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars could adversely affect our foreign sales or foreign product assembly 
our operations may be interrupted and our business would be harmed in the event of an earthquake  terrorist act  and other disasters 
our principal executive offices  our fab facility  and major suppliers are located in areas that have been subject to severe earthquakes 
in the event of an earthquake  we and or our major suppliers may be temporarily unable to continue operations and may suffer significant property damage 
any such interruption in our ability or that of our major suppliers to continue operations at our facilities could delay the development and shipment of our products 
like other us companies  our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the economic consequences of current and potential military actions or additional terrorist activities and associated political instability  and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce 
such uncertainties could also lead to delays or cancellations of customer orders  a general decrease in corporate spending or our inability to effectively market and sell our products 
any of these results could substantially harm our business and results of operations  causing a decrease in our revenues 
we depended upon one customer  microtek inc  for approximately of our fiscal sales 
microtek is our primary distributor in japan with at least twenty end user customers 
most of our customers can typically cancel or reschedule orders without penalty so decreased demand for our products could translate into rapid decreases in sales volume 
were microtek to cease being our distributor  we would need to attempt to retain an alternate distributor and or establish direct relations with the japanese end customers  either or both of which could result in decreased and delayed sales 
we are very dependent upon continued innovation of our engineers 
the competition for engineers with relevant experience is extremely intense in the silicon valley  where most of our engineers are located 
we must compete in terms of salary  benefits  and working conditions with many start ups which can offer more equity 
we established an ic design center in hong kong in fiscal where competition for qualified engineer is not as intense as that in silicon valley 
however  a majority of our product innovation activities remains in our sunnyvale and san jose offices 
we operate a fab in san jose  california at which we use various chemicals and solvents which are regulated by various environmental agencies 
we cooperate and work with these agencies to comply with these regulations 
should we nonetheless inadvertently contaminate the soil or ground water  or should the previous operator of the fab have done so  we may be responsible for significant costs to remediate the situation 
we are dependent upon the continued service of several of our key management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our engineers  executive officers and other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for  or to attract  retain and motivate these individuals would be harmful to our business 
we do not have long term employment contracts with our employees 
our success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  and know how  and to continue our technological innovation 
we cannot assure that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights could cause us to lose market share and harm our business 
the sarbanes oxley act of required us to change or supplement some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure and compliance practices 
the sec and nasdaq have revised  and continue to revise  their regulations and listing standards 
these developments have increased  and may continue to increase  our legal compliance and financial reporting costs 
these developments also may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
this  in turn  could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
failure to comply with present or future laws  rules and regulations of any kind that govern our business could result in suspension of all or a portion of production  cessation of all or a portion of operations  or the imposition of significant administrative  civil  or criminal penalties  any of which could harm our business 
changes in stock option accounting rules scheduled to go into effect at the start of our fiscal will impact our reported operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and may impact our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
the following table sets forth items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended april  april  march  net sales cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations other income interest income other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant estimates in these financial statements include provision for sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  estimates for useful lives associated with long lived assets  asset impairments  net realizable value of inventories  certain accrued liabilities and provision for income taxes and tax valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from direct product sales to end user customers upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is upon shipment of the product provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for sales to original equipment manufacturers oems  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a distributor agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
sales to our distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing limited rights of return  limited price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold by the distributors 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and possible returns  we defer the recognition of such sales and the related costs of sales until our distributors have sold the merchandise to their end user customers 
our distributors provide us an inventory balance report at the end of each period  which allows us to determine products sold to their end customer 
a small amount of our deferred revenue is from upfront billings from customers under non recurring engineering nre contracts as well as a customer advance under a licensing agreement 
we recognize revenue from our non recurring engineering nre contracts upon completion of contract milestones  which corresponds to when we provide the services and or products 
revenue is deferred for any amounts received prior to completion of engineering contract milestones  such as amounts received upon signing of contract 
some of our nre contracts include formal customer acceptance provisions 
in this case  at the end of each period  we determine whether customer acceptance has been obtained for the specific milestone 
if customer acceptance has not been obtained  we defer the recognition of such revenue until customer acceptance is obtained 
sales returns and other allowances we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical experience  analysis of outstanding return material authorization and allowance authorization data and any other form of notification we receive of pending returns 
we continuously monitor and track product returns and in circumstances where we are aware of specific customer return or allowance which is over and above normal historical sales returns  we record a specific allowance against the amounts due to reduce our net receivable for such customer 
while our sales returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  a minimum allowance is established for all customers based on a percentage applied to outstanding accounts receivable 
this percentage is based on our historical collection and write off experience 
second  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that a specific customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc 
to us 
in these cases  significant management judgments and estimates must be made  based on the best available facts and circumstances 
we record a specific allowance for that customer against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value and include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature and subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
standard manufacturing cost includes materials  labor  and overhead costs including depreciation  and includes factors for estimated production yield and throughput time 
we determine the market value of our inventories based on the average selling price of our products in the last month prior to the balance sheet date 
inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
any adjustment to write down inventory to market value is charged to the cost of sales in the period that the adjustment is made 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand during the next fifteen months 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand and inventories that we consider obsolete are reserved for 
additions to the provision are charged to the cost of sales 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the reduction of the allowance until these inventories are subsequently sold  after which the related allowance is matched to the movement of the related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
while the company has programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and considers technological obsolescence when estimating amounts required to reduce recorded amounts to market values  it is reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near term 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and will be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
accounting for investments and consolidation from time to time we may make investments in privately held companies  which requires us to determine the carrying value of such investments 
we currently own stock in a privately held company whose carrying value is zero as of april  and april  investments in privately held companies that are not publicly traded usually have no established market value 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition of each company 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value  it is our policy to record a reserve and the related write down is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
in addition  adverse operating results of underlying long term investments could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate or amortize over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset where appropriate 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimate change 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
the company makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities  which arise from timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
such deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
changes in tax rates affect the deferred income tax assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the tax rates are enacted 
the company must determine the probability that it will be able to utilize its deferred tax assets 
if the company determines that recovery is unlikely  then a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset must be recorded by increasing its income tax expense 
as of april   the company believes that its deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheet will be utilized 
however  should there be a change in its ability to utilize or recover its deferred tax assets  an additional income tax expense would be incurred in the period in which it was determined that the recovery is not probable 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent developments beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal  the global semiconductor industry conditions experienced a severe downturn that continued through the second half of fiscal during this time  conditions in all the markets we serve  particularly the telecom market  were weak 
demand for our products decreased  and sales were adversely impacted resulting in a sequential decline in fiscal years  and despite these declining sales  we have remained profitable and generated positive cash flows through rigorous cost control measures 
we experienced a modest recovery in sales in the first half of fiscal  but we saw sales declines in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we are hopeful that with expected improvements in the economy over the coming fiscal year  the business of our customers will increase leading to increased sales for us as well 
we believe that we will be able to substantially meet our production needs from our wafer fabrication and testing facilities in the coming fiscal year 
quote activities and design wins have been strong in all the markets we serve 
we have seen a higher sequential backlog and a book to bill ratio of greater than one  which are encouraging indicators for sales growth in the new fiscal year 
book to bill ratio is defined as sales orders received over orders shipped during the fiscal quarter 
we believe that current orders will be shipped in fiscal however  our customers may cancel or reschedule orders without significant penalty  and the price of products may be adjusted between the time the purchase order is booked into backlog and the time the product is shipped to the customer 
for these reasons  purchase orders received are not necessarily reliable indicators of future sales 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales net sales for the fiscal year were  a increase compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the company operates in one business segment comprising the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of high voltage analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and transistors 
the company has a broad base of customers  which in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple markets 
as such  the assignment of revenue to the aforementioned markets requires the use of estimates  judgment  and extrapolation 
actual results may differ from those reported 
a breakdown of our total sales to customers in the medical electronics  imaging  telecom and other markets as well as year over year and sequential percentage changes are as follows in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change markets april  april  medical electronics imaging telecom others net sales overall demand for our products in fiscal was higher compared to fiscal in all four markets except for sales to the imaging market 
this increase in overall net sales is primarily due to higher units sales across these markets as semiconductor market conditions improved and the initial production ramp of our more recently introduced products 
the company did not have material sales price erosion on its products 
our sales to the medical electronics market in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the sales increase is primarily attributed to an increase in ultrasound units shipped worldwide and to a lesser degree  from shipments of new products in the high voltage pulser area 
the company believes that sales to this market will continue to hold at this increased level as shipments of high voltage pulsers for the new portable and transportable systems and shipments of chip sets increase 
new ultrasound therapeutic applications should also add to the sales of our products in the coming fiscal year 
sales to the imaging market in fiscal showed a decrease of over the prior year primarily due to the reduced demand for the el backlighting products for monochrome displays in cellular phones 
in the third fiscal quarter  there was the start of a production ramp of our el backlighting products for backlighting keypads  but the ramp up was abruptly stopped in the fourth fiscal quarter  due to the unexpected push out by a major customer 
the company forecasts that new uses of the el backlighting products in backlighting keypads for cell phones  and for audio video remote controls and other handheld devices  requiring multi segment el backlighting  should more than offset the decline in use of el backlighting products for monochrome cell phone displays 
current backlog indicates a recovery of the demand for the el backlighting ics for keypads in the first fiscal quarter of and we expect the demand to grow throughout the fiscal sales of flat panel display products and non impact printers and plotters in our imaging group remained steady in fiscal and are expected to increase in fiscal sales to the telecom market in fiscal increased compared to prior fiscal year 
the increase in sales was the result of improving market conditions  and increased demand for dc to dc converters  long haul ring generators  protection devices and high voltage amplifier arrays for the optical to optical telecom market 
the company projects increased sales of the hotswap products as production at a major telecom equipment manufacturer customer ramps up 
this increase is expected to offset decline in sales of our some of our legacy products 
sales to other markets in fiscal increased compared to prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to increased custom processing shipments to a single customer whose end product is for the automotive market 
the company s principal markets are in the united states  europe  and asia 
sales by geography as well as year over year change  were as follows fiscal years ended year over year change dollars in thousands april  april  united states europe japan asia excl 
japan others total net sales net sales to international customers in fiscal were  or of the company s net sales as compared to  or of net sales for the prior fiscal year 
except for europe  all geographical locations listed above posted higher sales as market conditions improved 
the decline in sales to our european market was primarily caused by a slowdown at one major el segment lighting customer 
sales to our domestic customers increased during the same period primarily from higher demand for our standard products 
additional discussion regarding our sales based on geographic area can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross margin gross profit or gross margin represents net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of purchasing raw silicon wafers  cost associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel  facilities  and equipment associated with manufacturing support and charges for excess inventory 
gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year whereas our sales only increased by  thus  most of our increase in gross profit dollars was due to increased efficiency in the operations and decreased depreciation expenses 
fiscal years ended dollars in thousands april  april  gross margin percentage included in gross margin percentage above gross margin benefit from sale of previously written down inventory percentage of net sales our gross margin is for fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributed to lower depreciation charges  lower package assembly costs  and lower expense for process supplies and line maintenance 
declining capital spending in the last two years after the completion of major upgrades to the wafer fabrication facility and test operations resulted to a lower depreciation in fiscal compared to prior year 
last time build of a custom product at a sole source packaging vendor in the prior fiscal year caused an abnormal increase in package assembly cost during that period 
the absence of an abnormal assembly cost this fiscal year provided a favorable effect to the gross margin 
continued cost measures resulted to lower expenses in process supplies and line maintenance 
research and development fiscal years ended year to year change dollars in thousands april  april  r d expenses percentage of net sales research and development r d expenses include payroll and benefits  processing costs  and depreciation 
we also expense prototype wafers and mask sets related to new products as r d expenses until new products are released to production 
r d expenses were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for r d were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the net increase of  in r d expense for the current year was primarily due to increased manufacturing activity of prototype products 
design win activities remained strong 
the company expects to keep r d spending in fiscal year at of net sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a fiscal years ended year to year change dollars in thousands april  april  sg a expenses percentage of net sales sg a expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  commissions to sales representatives  occupancy expenses including expenses associated with the company s regional sales offices  cost of advertising and publications  and outside services such as legal  auditing  tax and compliance services related to sarbanes oxley act of sg a expenses were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in absolute dollars  sg a expenses were  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal the  increase in sg a expenses is primarily attributed to a  increase in payroll related expenses due to increased headcount  an increase in provision for bad debt expenses of  an increase in engineering supplies and services expenses of  an increase is sales related travel expenses of  all of which resulted from an increase in sales  and a  increase in expenses for professional services primarily from expenses related to compliance activities resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of  and in particular  section of the act  which requires documentation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting 
we expect that expenses for compliance activities of the sarbanes oxley act will decrease in fiscal sg a expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars as the company expands sales and marketing presence worldwide 
sg a expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
interest income and other income  net fiscal years ended year to year change dollars in thousands april  april  interest income and other income  net percentage of net sales interest income and other income  net for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in interest income was due primarily to increases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and slightly higher interest rates starting in the second quarter of fiscal other income  net other income  net for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in other income  net is primarily from the  increase in fair market value of investments held by the company s supplemental employee retirement plan serp compared to  in the prior year 
provision for income taxes the provision for incomes taxes represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal was  at the estimated effective tax rate of compared to  and for fiscal the increase in tax rate in fiscal is attributed to higher profit 
the difference between the federal statutory rate of and our effective tax rate used for fiscal of is primarily due to favorable foreign tax rate differential  r d credits and federal tax exempt investments 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal year was  a decrease of  or from the previous fiscal year net sales of  as a percentage of total net sales  sales to customers in the medical electronics  imaging  telecom and other market were as follows dollars in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change markets april  march  medical electronics imaging telecom others net sales overall demand for our products in fiscal was lower compared to fiscal however  sales in our telecom market showed a modest improvement over the prior year primarily as a result of the economic upturn in the semiconductor industry in the second half of fiscal sales to our telecom market increased compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily from our legacy isdn products and to a lesser extent from our optical to optical switcher arrays 
sales to the medical electronics market dropped compared to prior fiscal year due to a delay in production of certain newer high end platforms utilizing our chip scale package products 
the decrease in sales to our imaging market reflected softness in the consumer usage of el backlights 
the company s principal markets are in the united states  europe  and asia 
sales by geography as well as year over year change  were as follows fiscal years ended year over year change dollars in thousands april  march  united states europe japan asia excluding japan others total revenue in fiscal  we derived approximately of our net sales from customers outside the united states  primarily in asia and europe  compared to in fiscal dollar sales to international customers also increased approximately from  to  for the fiscal year ended march  and april  respectively 
these percentages have been adjusted to reflect a change in our aggregation of geographic sales information 
sales are now attributed to geographic area based on destination location 
the increase in the percentage of international sales is attributed to increase in shipments to destination locations in asia excluding japan while sales in the united states declined 
we believe that part of this shift reflects changes in our customers manufacturing trends with more customers increasing their production operations in asia 
additional discussion regarding our sales based on geographic area can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross margin fiscal years ended dollars in thousands april  march  gross margin percentage included in gross margin percentage above gross margin benefit from sale of previously written down inventory percentage of net sales gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of wafer fabrication  cost associated with assembly  packaging  test  quality assurance and product yields  the cost of personnel  facilities  and equipment associated with manufacturing support and charges for excess inventory 
gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal gross profit in fiscal includes a benefit of  which represents the release of provision for inventory previously written down and sold during the year compared to  in fiscal our gross profit as a percentage of net sales fluctuates  depending on product mix  manufacturing yields  utilization of manufacturing capacity  and average selling prices  among other factors 
our gross margin was for fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the gross margin improvement was primarily due to rigorous cost reduction measures and lower depreciation expenses 
in fiscal  we successfully qualified our in house ion implantation process that resulted in reductions in our outside service costs and favorably impacted our gross profit 
depreciation expense in fiscal was lower than fiscal due to declining capital spending in the last few years  thereby reducing the depreciable cost 
we have completed the upgrades to our fab and test operations  which we started in fiscal research and development fiscal years ended year to year change dollars in thousands april  march  r d expenses percentage of net sales research and development r d expenses include payroll and benefits  processing costs  and depreciation 
we also expense prototype wafers and mask sets related to new products as r d expenses until new products are released to production 
r d expenses were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for research and development were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the net increase of  in r d expense was primarily due to an increase in costs related to new process and new product development offset by a reduction in payroll  software licensing costs and lower depreciation expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a fiscal years ended year to year change dollars in thousands april  march  sg a expenses percentage of net sales sg a expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  commissions to sales representatives  occupancy expenses including expenses associated with our regional sales offices  cost of advertising and publications  and outside services such as legal  auditing and tax services 
sg a expenses were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in absolute dollars  sg a expenses were  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal this  or increase in sg a was attributed to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses of  an increase in legal expenses of  an increase in occupancy cost of  an increase in bad debt expenses of  an increase in travel and entertainment expenses of  offset by a reduction in advertising and publication charges of  the increase in payroll and benefits expenses was attributed to the increase in compensation expense resulting primarily from the increase in valuation of plan assets for the company s supplemental employee retirement plan of  as well as an increase in headcount in our sales and marketing group 
we have expanded our sales efforts in the far east  which also caused an increase in travel and entertainment expenses during fiscal the increase in legal expenses year over year is due to a benefit from a reversal of a provision for legal expenses in fiscal following the favorable resolution of a claim initiated by a customer 
this reversal resulted in a benefit of  realized in fiscal year the increase in occupancy costs is attributed to an increase in facilities maintenance costs 
bad debt expenses in the prior year were favorably impacted by the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable of  the reduction in advertising expenses in fiscal was due to cost control measures 
interest income and other income  net fiscal years ended year to year change dollars in thousands april  march  interest income and other income  net percentage of net sales interest income and other income  net for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the moderate increase in interest income in fiscal is due to larger average cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balance in the current periods compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year 
other income  net other income  net of  for fiscal consisted primarily of an increase in fair market value of investments held by the company s supplemental employee retirement plan of  and licensing income of  for the comparable period in fiscal  other income  net  of  consisted of a gain on sale of a long term investment of  and an increase in the fair market value of investments held in the company s supplemental employee retirement plan of  licensing income of  offset by a loss from disposal of equipment of  and an impairment charge of  due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of another long term investment 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for fiscal is of income before provision for income taxes compared to in fiscal the company reduced its effective tax rate due to a higher proportion of its earnings attributed to its foreign based subsidiary  which is in a lower tax jurisdiction 
financial condition overview cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balance as of april  was  compared with  on april   and  on march  working capital was  an increase of  from  as of april  working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
the increase in working capital was mostly the result of cash generated from operations
