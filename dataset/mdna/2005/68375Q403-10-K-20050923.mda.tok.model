management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control  including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls 
accordingly  even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurances with respect to financial statement preparation 
further  because of changes in conditions  the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june  in making this assessment  our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission in internal control integrated framework 
based on its assessment using those criteria  our management concluded that  as of june   our internal control over financial reporting is effective
