item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
historical operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company wishes to caution readers that this report contains  and future filings by the company  press releases and oral statements made by the company s authorized representatives may contain  forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
readers can identify these forward looking statements by the use of such verbs as expects  anticipates  believes or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements due to important factors bearing on the company s business  many of which already have been discussed in this filing and in the company s prior filings 
the differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including  but not limited to  the risk factors described below 
you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties  and all other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  before making an investment in our common stock 
any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the demand for our products is cyclical  which could adversely impact our revenues 
the end markets for fully assembled bearings are cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial and automotive production 
as a result  the market for bearing components is also cyclical and impacted by overall levels of industrial and automotive production 
our sales in the past have been negatively affected  and in the future will be negatively affected  by adverse conditions in the industrial and or automotive production sectors of the economy or by adverse global or national economic conditions generally 
we depend on a very limited number of foreign sources for our primary raw material and are subject to risks of shortages and price fluctuation 
the steel that we use to manufacture precision balls and rollers is of an extremely high quality and is available from a limited number of producers on a global basis 
due to quality constraints in the us steel industry  we obtain substantially all of the steel used in our us ball and roller production from overseas suppliers 
in addition  we obtain substantially all of the steel used in our european ball production from a single european source 
if we had to obtain steel from sources other than our current suppliers we could face higher prices and transportation costs  increased duties or taxes  and shortages of steel 
due to china s increasing consumption of steel  we have received indications from our suppliers that steel availability in the quantities and types we require may be volatile in problems in obtaining steel  and particularly chrome steel  in the quantities that we require and on commercially reasonable terms  could increase our costs  adversely impacting our ability to operate our business efficiently and have a material adverse effect on the revenues and operating and financial results of our company 
the price of steel has risen over the last twelve to eighteen months with the potential for prices to reflect even greater increases 
the increase is principally due to general increases in global demand and  more recently  due to china s increased consumption of steel 
this has had the impact of increasing scrap surcharges we pay in procuring our steel in the form of higher unit prices and scrap surcharges and could adversely impact the availability of steel 
our contracts with key customers allow us to pass a majority of the steel price increases on to those customers 
however  by contract  material price changes in any given year are typically passed along with price adjustments in january of the following year 
until the current increases can be passed through to our customers  income from operations  net income and cash flow from operations will be adversely affected 
we depend heavily on a relatively limited number of customers  and the loss of any major customer would have a material adverse effect on our business 
sales to various us and foreign divisions of skf  which is one of the largest bearing manufacturers in the world  accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales in  and sales to ina accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales in sales to various divisions of the timken company accounted for approximately of our net sales in during  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
none of our other customers individually accounted for more than of our consolidated net sales for the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to these customers would cause us to lose a substantial portion of our revenue and would lower our operating profit margin and cash flows from operations 
we operate in and sell products to customers outside the us and are subject to several related risks 
because we obtain a majority of our raw materials from overseas suppliers  actively participate in overseas manufacturing operations and sell to a large number of international customers  we face risks associated with the following o adverse foreign currency fluctuations  o changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  and other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations  o the imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions  o high tax rates that discourage the repatriation of funds to the us  o the imposition of import or other duties or taxes  and o unstable governments or legal systems in countries in which our suppliers  manufacturing operations  and customers are located 
we do not have a hedging program in place associated with consolidating the operating results of our foreign businesses into us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar and or the euro relative to other currencies may adversely affect our ability to compete with our foreign based competitors for international  as well as domestic  sales 
also  a decline in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar will negatively impact our consolidated financial results  which are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  due to the typical slower summer manufacturing season in europe  we expect that revenues in the third fiscal quarter will reflect lower sales  as our sales to european customers have increased as a percentage of net sales 
the costs and difficulties of integrating acquired business could impede our future growth 
we cannot assure you that any future acquisition will enhance our financial performance 
our ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions will depend on  among other things  the adequacy of our implementation plans  the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies and sales goals 
the integration of any acquired businesses might cause us to incur unforeseen costs  which would lower our profit margin and future earnings and would prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of these acquisitions 
we may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for us to realize our growth strategy 
acquiring businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and continues to be an important element of our business strategy 
this strategy calls for growth through acquisitions constituting approximately three fourths of our future growth  with the remainder resulting from internal growth and market penetration 
we bought our plastic bearing component business in  formed nn europe with our two largest bearing customers  skf and ina  in and acquired our bearing seal operations in during  we purchased ina s minority interest in nn europe and during we purchased skf s minority interest in nn europe and skf s tapered roller and metal cage manufacturing operations in veenendaal  the netherlands 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms in the future 
in addition  we may borrow funds to acquire other businesses  increasing our interest expense and debt levels 
our inability to acquire businesses  or to operate them profitably once acquired  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our growth strategy depends on outsourcing  and if the industry trend toward outsourcing does not continue  our business could be adversely affected 
our growth strategy depends in significant part on major bearing manufacturers continuing to outsource components  and expanding the number of components being outsourced 
this requires manufacturers to depart significantly from their traditional methods of operations 
if major bearing manufacturers do not continue to expand outsourcing efforts or determine to reduce their use of outsourcing  our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected 
our market is highly competitive and many of our competitors have significant advantages that could adversely affect our business 
the global market for bearing components is highly competitive  with a majority of production represented by the captive production operations of certain large bearing manufacturers and the balance represented by independent manufacturers 
captive manufacturers make components for internal use and for sale to third parties 
all of the captive manufacturers  and many independent manufacturers  are significantly larger and have greater resources than do we 
our competitors are continuously exploring and implementing improvements in technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality  and our ability to remain competitive will depend  among other things  on whether we are able to keep pace with such quality improvements in a cost effective manner 
the production capacity we have added over the last several years has at times resulted in our having more capacity than we need  causing our operating costs to be higher than expected 
we have expanded our ball and roller production facilities and capacity over the last several years 
during  we built an additional manufacturing plant in kilkenny  ireland  and we continued this expansion in through the formation of nn europe with skf and ina 
our ball and roller production facilities have not always operated at full capacity and from time to time our results of operations have been adversely affected by the under utilization of our production facilities  and we face risks of further under utilization or inefficient utilization of our production facilities in future years 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and may decline 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are o our operating and financial performance and prospects  o quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators  such as earnings per share  net income and revenues  o changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  o loss of any member of our senior management team  o speculation in the press or investment community  o strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  o sales of our common stock by stockholders  o general market conditions  o domestic and international economic  legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance  and o loss of a major customer 
the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware corporate law  contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable and may prevent you from receiving a takeover premium for your shares 
these provisions include  for example  a classified board of directors and the authorization of our board of directors to issue up to  preferred shares without a stockholder vote 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders may not call a special meeting 
we are a delaware corporation subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
generally  this statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which such person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder 
we anticipate that the provisions of section may encourage parties interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors  because the stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if a majority of the directors then in office approve either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder 
these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  the market price of our common stock could decline 
overview and management focus our strategy and management focus is based upon the following long term objectives o captive growth  providing a competitive and attractive alternative to the operations of our global customers o expansion of our bearing product offering  and o global expansion of our manufacturing base to better address the global requirements of our customers management generally focuses on these trends and relevant market indicators o global industrial growth and economics o global automotive production rates o costs subject to the global inflationary environment  including  but not limited to o raw material o wages and benefits  including health care costs o regulatory compliance o energy o raw material availability o trends related to the geographic migration of competitive manufacturing o regulatory environment for united states public companies o currency and exchange rate movements and trends o interest rate levels and expectations management generally focuses on the following key indicators of operating performance o sales growth o cost of products sold levels o selling  general and administrative expense levels o net income o cash flow from operations and capital spending our core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality  precision steel balls and rollers 
in  sales of balls and rollers accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales with and of sales from balls and rollers  respectively 
sales of metal bearing retainers accounted for and sales of precision molded plastic and rubber parts accounted for the remaining 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since our formation in we have grown primarily through the displacement of captive ball manufacturing operations of domestic and international bearing manufacturers resulting in increased sales of high precision balls for quiet bearing applications 
management believes that our core business sales growth since our formation has been due to our ability to capitalize on opportunities in global markets and provide precision products at competitive prices  as well as our emphasis on product quality and customer service 
in  we recognized changing dynamics in the marketplace  and as a result  developed and began implementing an extensive long term growth strategy building upon our core business and leveraging our inherent strengths to better serve our global customer base 
as part of this strategy  we sought to augment our intrinsic growth with complementary acquisitions that fit specific criteria 
on july   we acquired substantially all of the assets of earsley capital corporation  formerly known as industrial molding corporation imc for consideration of approximately million 
formed in  imc provides full service design and manufacture of plastic injection molded components to the bearing  automotive  electronic  leisure and consumer markets with an emphasis on value added products that take advantage of its capabilities in product development  tool design and tight tolerance molding processes 
imc operates two manufacturing facilities in lubbock  texas 
on july   we formed a majority owned stand alone company in europe  nn europe aps nn europe  for the manufacture and sale of chrome steel balls used for ball bearings and other products 
as a result of this transaction  we owned of nn europe 
skf and ina respectively each owned of nn europe 
as part of the transaction  nn europe acquired the ball factories located in pinerolo  italy previously owned by skf  eltmann  germany previously owned by ina  and kilkenny  ireland previously owned by the company 
acquisition financing of approximately million euro approximately million was drawn at closing  and the credit facility provided for additional working capital expenditure financing 
in connection with this transaction  total equity  specifically additional paid in capital  increased by million euros million to reflect the increase in our proportionate interest in nn europe as related to our ownership as more fully detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have always consolidated nn europe due to our majority ownership and have accounted for the acquisitions of the pinerolo  italy and eltmann  germany ball factories in a manner similar to the purchase method of accounting 
on december  we completed the purchase of the interest held by ina 
we paid approximately million euros million for ina fag s interest in nn europe 
the excess of the purchase price paid to ina for its interest over fair value of ina s interest in the net assets of nn europe of approximately million has been allocated to goodwill see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on may  we acquired the interest in nn europe held by skf 
we paid approximately million euros million for skf s interest in nn europe 
the excess of the purchase price paid to skf for its interest over the fair value of skf s interest in the net assets of nn europe of approximately million was allocated to goodwill 
on february   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of the delta rubber company  a connecticut corporation delta  for million in cash 
delta provides high quality engineered bearing seals and other precision molded rubber products to original equipment manufacturers 
delta operates two manufacturing facilities in danielson  connecticut 
we have accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
on september   we announced the closing of our walterboro  south carolina ball manufacturing facility effective december the closing was made as part of our strategy to redistribute our global production in order to better utilize capacity and serve the needs of our worldwide customers 
the precision ball production of the walterboro facility has been fully absorbed by our remaining us ball roller manufacturing facilities located in erwin and mountain city  tennessee 
in and we recorded before tax charges associated with the closing of million and million  respectively 
in  this amount includes a million before tax charge for the recording of impairment on our manufacturing facility located in walterboro  south carolina and million related to employee severance costs 
in  this amount includes a million before tax charge for the recording of an additional impairment on the facility  a million before tax charge for the recording of impairment on the machinery and equipment and a million charge related to employee severance costs 
there were no impairment charges related to these assets recorded in these amounts are reflected as restructuring and impairment costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the land and building assets were sold during the fourth quarter of as a result  we recorded a loss on disposal of assets of approximately million which has been recorded as a loss on disposal of assets  a component of income from operations 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to certain remaining machinery and equipment assets of this facility 
this amount was recorded as a component of restructuring and impairment costs 
the financial results of this operation have been reflected in the domestic ball and roller segment 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective december   we sold our minority interest in jiangsu general ball roller company  ltd  a chinese ball and roller manufacturer located in rugao city  jiangsu province  china 
to effect the transaction  we sold our ownership in nn general  llc  which owns a interest in the jiangsu joint venture to our partner  general bearing corporation for cash of million and notes of million 
on may  we acquired of the tapered roller and metal cage manufacturing operations of skf in veenendaal  the netherlands 
the results of veenendaal s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
we paid consideration of approximately million euros million and incurred other costs of approximately million  for the veenendaal net assets acquired from skf 
the veenendaal operation manufactures rollers for tapered roller bearings and metal cages for both tapered roller and spherical roller bearings allowing us to expand our bearing component offering 
the financial results of the veenendaal operation are included in the nn europe segment 
on october   we acquired certain assets comprised of land  building and machinery and equipment of the precision ball operations of klf gulickaren klf  based in kysucke nove mesto  slovakia 
we paid consideration of approximately million euros million 
the assets are being utilized by our wholly owned subsidiary nn slovakia based in kysucke nove mesto  slovakia  which began production in the financial results of the operations are included in our nn europe segment 
during we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  nn precision bearing products company  ltd 
this subsidiary  which is expected to begin production of precision balls during the second half of  will be located in the kunshan economic and technology development zone  jiangsu  the people s republic of china and is a component of our strategy to globally expand our manufacturing base 
the implementation and successful execution of this acquisition strategy to date has allowed the company to expand its global presence and positions the company for continued global growth and expansion into core served markets 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgment underlying them  are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting and pension and post retirement benefits 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not significantly differ from the estimates used in these critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are recorded upon recognition of a sale of goods and ownership and risk of loss is assumed by the customer 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due primarily from the core served markets bearing manufacturers  automotive industry  electronics  industrial  agricultural and aerospace 
the company experienced million of bad debt expense during  million during and million during in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  the company performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs when available including the customers financial position  past payment history  relevant industry trends  cash flows  management capability  historical loss experience and economic conditions and prospects 
accounts receivable are written off or reserves established when considered to be uncollectible or at risk of being uncollectible 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
the company s inventories are not generally subject to obsolescence due to spoilage or expiring product life cycles 
the company operates generally as a make to order business  however  the company also stocks products for certain customers in order to meet delivery schedules 
while management believes that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  the company could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
acquisitions and acquired intangibles 
for new acquisitions  the company uses estimates  assumptions and appraisals to allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and to determine the amount of goodwill 
these estimates are based on market analyses and comparisons to similar assets 
annual tests are required to be performed to assess whether recorded goodwill is impaired 
the annual tests require management to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the future operations of its reporting units  the expected cash flows that they will generate  and their market value 
these estimates and assumptions therefore impact the recorded value of assets acquired in a business combination  including goodwill  and whether or not there is any subsequent impairment of the recorded goodwill and the amount of such impairment 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment 
the recoverability of the long term assets is dependent on the performance of the companies which the company has acquired  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these acquisitions 
in assessing potential impairment for these assets the company will consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance 
for assets held for sale  appraisals are relied upon to assess the fair market value of those assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions or adverse operating results of the underlying assets could result in the company having to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
pension and post retirement obligations 
the company uses several assumptions in determining its periodic pension and post retirement expense and obligations which are included in the consolidated financial statements 
these assumptions include determining an appropriate discount rate  rate of compensation increase as well as the remaining service period of active employees 
the company uses an independent actuary to calculate the periodic pension and post retirement expense and obligations based upon these assumptions and actual employee census data 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected financial data and the percentage of the company s net sales represented by each income statement line item presented 
as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of product sold exclusive of depreciation shown separately below selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization gain loss on disposal of assets restructuring and impairment costs income from operations interest expense other income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary net income off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease commitments for machinery  office equipment  vehicles  manufacturing and office space which expire on varying dates 
the following is a schedule by year of future minimum lease payments as of december  under operating leases that have initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year 
year ended december  thereafter  total minimum lease payments  on june   our wholly owned subsidiary  nn precision bearing products company ltd  entered into a twenty year lease agreement with kunshan tian li steel structure co 
ltd for the lease of land and building approximately  square feet in the kunshan economic and technology development zone  jiangsu  the people s republic of china 
the building will be newly constructed and we expect to begin usage of the leased property during the second quarter or third quarter of the land and building remain under the control of the lessor until such time as usage of the leased property commences 
the agreement satisfies the requirements of a capital lease and we anticipate recording the lease as a capital lease in our consolidated financial statements when usage of the leased property begins 
accordingly  as of december   no amount has been recorded related to the asset and corresponding obligation associated with the lease agreement in our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair value of the land and building to be approximately million and undiscounted annual lease payments of approximately million approximately million aggregate non discounted lease payments over the twenty year term 
the lease terms include fair value buy out provisions and we maintain the option to extend the lease term

impacts of foreign currency translation within the nn europe segment contributed million of the increase 
the remaining increase of million within the nn europe segment is related to our slovakia ball production facility and capital spending increases 
there was no change to depreciation and amortization expense within the domestic ball and roller segment and the plastic and rubber components segment 
as a percentage of net sales  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased from in to in gain loss on disposal of assets 
gain loss on disposal of assets changed million from a gain of million in to a loss of million in within the domestic ball and roller segment  the loss recorded in is principally associated with the december sale of our idle walterboro  south carolina land and building assets 
this ball production facility was closed in as a part of our ongoing strategy to locate manufacturing capacity in closer proximity to our customers 
the loss on disposal of assets was of net sales in restructuring and impairment costs 
restructuring and impairment costs decreased by million from million in to million in in  the million of restructuring and impairment costs is related to severance costs and related charges for approximately employees at our eltmann  germany ball production facility  a component of the nn europe segment

in connection with the issuance of the million notes  capitalized costs in the amount of approximately million associated with structuring of the million credit facility were written off during the twelve months ended december  and are included as a component of other income expense 
during may  we completed a public offering of million shares of our stock by a group of selling shareholders

to date  cash generated by nn europe and its subsidiaries has been used exclusively for general  nn europe specific purposes including investments in property  plant and equipment and prepayment of the euro term loan  which is secured by nn europe and its subsidiaries 
accordingly  no dividends have been declared or paid by nn europe that may have been used by the company to pay down our domestic credit facilities 
the company s arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide that payments are due within days following the date of the company s shipment of goods  while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreign customers that have entered into an inventory management program with the company generally provide that payments are due within or days following the date of shipment 
under the domestic ball and roller segments inventory management program with certain european customers  payments typically are due within days after the customer uses the product 
the company s sales and receivables can be influenced by seasonality due to the company s relative percentage of european business coupled with many foreign customers ceasing production during the month of august

the company bills and receives payment from some of its foreign customers in euro as well as other currencies 
to date  the company has not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations or foreign exchange restrictions 
nonetheless  as a result of these sales  the company s foreign exchange transaction and translation risk has increased 
various strategies to manage this risk are available to management including producing and selling in local currencies and hedging programs 
as of december   no currency hedges were in place 
in addition  a strengthening of the us dollar and or euro against foreign currencies could impair the ability of the company to compete with international competitors for foreign as well as domestic sales 
working capital  which consists principally of accounts receivable and inventories  was million at december  as compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased from to at december  and at december  cash flow from operations increased to million during from million during and million during contributing to this change were principally improvements in the changes in operating assets and liabilities for the twelve months ended in comparison to the twelve months ended as follows inventory million  accounts receivable million and accounts payable million 
during  we plan to spend approximately million on capital expenditures related primarily to equipment and process upgrades and replacements and approximately million principally related to geographic expansion of our manufacturing base 
we intend to finance these activities with cash generated from operations and funds available under our credit facilities 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and borrowings will be sufficient to finance the company s working capital needs  projected capital expenditure requirements and dividend payments through december the table below sets forth certain of the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  certain payments due by period contractual obligations total less than years years after years year long term debt      expected interest payments      operating leases      capital leases   expected pension contributions and benefit payments     other long term obligations   total contractual cash obligations      on june   our wholly owned subsidiary  nn precision bearing products company ltd  entered into a twenty year lease agreement with kunshan tian li steel structure co 
ltd for the lease of land and building approximately  square feet in the kunshan economic and technology development zone  jiangsu  the people s republic of china 
the building will be newly constructed and we expect to begin usage of the leased property during the second quarter of the land and building remain under the control of the lessor until such time as usage of the leased property commences 
the agreement satisfies the requirements of a capital lease at june  and we anticipate recording the lease as a capital lease in our consolidated financial statements when usage of the leased property begins 
accordingly  as of december   no amount has been recorded related to the asset and corresponding obligation associated with the lease agreement in our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair value of the land and building to be approximately million and undiscounted annual lease payments of approximately million approximately million aggregate non discounted lease payments over the twenty year term 
the lease terms include fair value buy out provisions and we maintain the option of extend the lease term 
although no amounts have been recorded related to this lease agreement in our consolidated financial statements as of december   the capital leases line in the table above reflects the obligation as if the lease was recorded as of june   the date we estimate the company will begin to use the property 
no other amounts are included in capital leases above 
other long term obligations consist of steel purchase commitments at the nn europe segment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the euro the company currently has operations in ireland  germany  italy and the netherlands  all of which are euro participating countries  and  each facility sells product to customers in many of the participating countries 
the euro has been adopted as the functional currency at all locations in the nn europe segment  except slovakia whose functional currency is the slovak korona 
slovakia joined the european union in may and current plans call for slovakia to adopt the euro as its functional currency at a later date 
seasonality and fluctuation in quarterly results the company s net sales historically have been seasonal in nature  due to a significant portion of the company s sales being to european customers that cease or significantly slow production during the month of august

inflation and changes in prices while the company s operations have not been materially affected by inflation during recent years  prices for steel  engineered resins and other raw materials purchased by the company are subject to material change  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and management focus 
for example  during  due to an increase in worldwide demand for steel and the decrease in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies  the company experienced an increase in the price of steel and some difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of steel from its existing suppliers 
in our us operations our typical pricing arrangements with steel suppliers are subject to adjustment once every six months 
the company s nn europe segment has entered into long term agreements with its primary steel supplier which provide for standard terms and conditions and annual pricing adjustments to offset material price fluctuations in steel and quarterly scrap surcharge adjustments 
the company typically reserves the right to increase product prices periodically in the event of increases in its raw material costs 
in the past  the company has been able to minimize the impact on its operations resulting from the steel price fluctuations by taking such measures 
however  by contract  material price changes in any given year are passed along with price adjustments in january of the following year 
certain sales agreements are in effect with skf and ina  which provide for minimum purchase quantities and specified  annual sales price adjustments that may be modified up or down for changes in material costs

the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through in return  the act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our business due to our use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies 
to mitigate our exposure to these market risks  we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of financial market risks 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities 
at december   these borrowings included million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  a million revolving credit facility  and a million euro million term loan which was used to maintain liquidity and fund our business operations 
at december   we had million outstanding of senior notes  million outstanding under the domestic credit facilities and nn europe had million euro million outstanding under the euro term loan 
at december   a one percent increase in the interest rate charged on our outstanding borrowings under both credit facilities would result in interest expense increasing annually by approximately million 
in connection with a variable euribor rate debt financing in july our majority owned subsidiary  nn europe entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of euro million for the purpose of fixing the interest rate on a portion of their debt financing 
the interest rate swap provides for us to receive variable euribor interest payments and pay fixed interest 
the interest rate swap agreement expires in july and the notional amount amortizes in relation to principal payments on the underlying debt over the life of the swap 
this original debt was repaid in may  however  the swap remains pursuant to its original terms

translation of the company s operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies is impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
our nn europe segment bills and receives payment from some of its foreign customers in their own currency 
to date  the company has not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations of foreign exchange restrictions 
however  to help reduce exposure to foreign currency fluctuation  management has incurred debt in euros and periodically used foreign currency hedges 
these currency hedging programs allow management to hedge currency exposures when these exposures meet certain discretionary levels 
the company did not hold a position in any foreign currency hedging instruments as of december
