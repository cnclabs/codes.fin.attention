item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is one of the largest independent bulk shipping companies in the world 
the company s operating fleet consists of vessels aggregating million dwt  including six vessels that are owned by joint ventures in which the company has an average interest of  and vessels that have been chartered in under operating leases 
seven of the chartered in vessels are vlccs 
the company has less than a interest in six of the chartered in vlccs  with an average participation interest of 
three of the chartered in vessels are aframaxes in which the company has an average participation interest of 
in addition  the company has a participation interest of in the time charter in of one vlcc  which is scheduled to commence upon its delivery from a shipyard in mid four lng carriers are scheduled to be delivered in late and early to a joint venture in which the company has a interest 
acquisition of stelmar shipping ltd 
on december   osg announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement to acquire stelmar shipping ltd 
stelmar  a leading international provider of petroleum product and crude oil transportation services with one of the world s largest and most modern handysize and panamax tanker fleets 
the transaction closed on january  accordingly  the operating results of the stelmar fleet will be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements commencing january  under the terms of the merger agreement  holders of stelmar s common stock received per share in cash for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
taking into account the assumption of stelmar s outstanding debt  the total purchase price was approximately billion 
the company funded the acquisition and the refinancing of stelmar s debt with million of borrowings under new credit facilities and million of cash and borrowings under long term credit facilities in existence as of december  stelmar s vessel fleet consists of handysize  panamax and three aframax tankers 
stelmar s fleet includes two chartered in aframax and nine chartered in handysize vessels 
one hundred percent of the fully owned fleet is double hull 
in addition  five of the chartered in vessels are double hull and the balance are double sided 
stelmar  through its maintenance of a modern fleet and commitment to safety  has earned an excellent reputation for providing high quality transportation services to major oil companies  oil traders and state owned oil companies 
the following discussion of the results of operations does not reflect the impact of the inclusion of the stelmar vessels 
operations the company s revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by the company and the trades in which those vessels operate 
rates for the transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products from which the company earns a substantial majority of its revenue are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for oil  the distance that cargoes must be transported  and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported 
the demand for oil shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy and level of opec s exports 
the number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service  principally because of scrapping 
the company s revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot voyage charter and long term time charter 
because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters  the company manages its vessels based on time charter equivalent tce revenues 
management makes economic decisions based on anticipated tce rates and evaluates financial performance based on tce rates achieved 
overview the year was one of the best years in the history of the tanker industry with freight rates reaching levels not seen since the early s as a result of the increasing significance of china  india and other asian countries as major oil consumers combined with strong import growth in north america 
sharply rising demand from asia combined with the growing demand of the world s developed nations  strained oil production and tanker capacity  as evidenced by the record high crude oil prices and tanker freight rates recorded in opec came within million barrels per day b d of fully utilizing its spare capacity  a large portion of which is located in saudi arabia 
current tanker markets have become very tightly balanced as a consequence of the unprecedented levels of world oil demand and production  where even a slight change in any of the factors affecting supply or demand can cause sharp fluctuations in tanker freight rates 
war  political uncertainty  bottlenecks caused by inadequate infrastructure  stricter environmental regulations  and natural disasters  such as hurricanes  have all affected the tanker markets in while rates were extremely volatile throughout the year  average rates across the year were the highest they have been in over years 
set forth in the tables below are daily tce rates that prevailed in markets in which the company s vessels operated for the periods indicated 
in each case  the rates may differ from the actual tce rates achieved by the company because of the timing and length of voyages and the portion of revenue generated from long term charters 
it is important to note that the spot market is quoted in worldscale rates 
the conversion of worldscale rates to the following tce rates necessarily requires the company to make certain assumptions as to brokerage commissions  port time  weather delays  port costs  speed and fuel consumption  all of which will vary in actual usage 
foreign flag vlcc segment spot market tce rates vlccs in the arabian gulf q q q q average       high       low       during  rates for vlccs trading out of the arabian gulf averaged  per day  higher than the average for and almost five times the average for the development of vlcc rates over was extremely positive  with a number of structural  cyclical and extraordinary factors influencing the market 
the global economic recovery  which began in  gathered pace during  because of strong growth in the us and china 
this acceleration in economic activity in the main oil importing regions of the world helped spur a increase in world oil demand over levels to million b d from million b d 
this is the biggest year to year increase in world oil demand since even europe  where economic growth has been relatively modest in recent years  experienced its largest annual increase in oil consumption since the increase in demand  coupled with dislocations primarily affecting short haul availabilities  increased the world s dependence on long haul middle east supplies 
opec crude oil output increased by million b d to million b d in  the highest level since about one third of this increase was due to progress in the recovery of iraq s oil sector from the effects of the war in a larger than usual portion of iraq s exports were shipped through its southern ports rather than through its pipeline to the mediterranean port of ceyhan  which operated at only of capacity in due to frequent sabotage 
the reported number of vlcc liftings from the arabian gulf  by far the largest vlcc loading area  rose by in vlcc rates  which rose rapidly in the final quarter of  continued their ascent in the first quarter of  reaching a first quarter high of  per day 
besides very strong seasonal demand  rates were boosted by severe congestion in turkey s bosporus straits  restricting the number of suezmaxes available to compete for cargoes from west africa and the middle east 
the seasonal reduction in global oil demand in the second quarter turned out to be much shorter than expected 
this was driven by the rapidly rising energy requirements of newly industrializing economies  such as china  where there has been a tendency for demand to peak ahead of the cooling season  rather than heating season 
the growing reliance in china on backup diesel fired generators  resulted in stockpiling of gasoil in anticipation of summer power outages 
the early arrival of summer weather in some areas of china contributed to the second quarter surge in oil demand 
thus  second quarter global oil demand slipped only million b d from the first quarter  less than the average decline of the prior three years 
average vlcc rates fell by just from the first quarter compared with a drop during the corresponding period in in the third quarter  the strength of asian oil demand was bolstered by a heat wave in japan  as well as an explosion at a nuclear reactor  which caused several more nuclear power plants to be shut down  increasing japan s dependency on oil fired power generation 
in the us gulf of mexico  a particularly severe hurricane season resulted in a substantial portion of the region s offshore production being shut down  further increasing us dependence on middle eastern crude 
as a consequence  international oil markets tightened even more and forced crude prices to new highs  prompting opec to abandon its production quotas and make extra spot cargoes available during the third and fourth quarters 
in the fourth quarter  world oil demand rose to an estimated record million b d  helping to support the rise in vlcc rates to a year high of  per day 
rates began to drop sharply from these levels in mid december  triggered by opec s announcement that it would reduce production by million b d beginning january  and a relatively mild start to winter 
the onset of colder temperatures in mid january demonstrated the volatility characteristic of current tanker markets as a renewed perception that markets were still tightly balanced caused rates once again to turn higher 
the world vlcc fleet grew to vessels million dwt at december  from vessels million dwt at the start of vlcc newbuilding deliveries amounted to vessels million dwt in  a slowdown from vessels million dwt in  but  as a result of the strong earnings environment in  scrap sales dropped to just three vessels million dwt in compared with vessels million dwt in newbuilding orders totaled vessels million dwt in  marking a slowdown from the vessels million dwt ordered in this drop in ordering was caused in part by a scarcity of newbuilding berths and longer delivery lead times stemming from high ordering in other bulk shipping sectors most vessels ordered during were for delivery in late and 
much higher newbuilding prices  higher than year ago levels also discouraged some owners from making new purchases 
as of december   the vlcc orderbook totaled vessels million dwt  equivalent to  based on deadweight tons  of the existing vlcc fleet 
foreign flag aframax segment spot market tce rates aframaxes in the caribbean q q q q average       high       low       during  rates for aframaxes operating in the caribbean averaged  per day  higher than the average for and higher than the average for aframax rates have benefited from global economic growth and a rise in oil production from key aframax loading regions 
non opec oil production increased by million b d in compared with  led by the former soviet union fsu 
the fsu increased its oil output by relative to  a growth rate slightly below that of the previous two years  and seaborne oil exports by  as progress was made on various pipeline and port expansion projects 
aframaxes carried of seaborne fsu exports in  unchanged from  but there has been some repositioning of aframax tonnage to the baltic sea and away from the black sea 
in the caribbean  venezuelan output continued to recover from the general strike in december average daily output was higher in compared with  but still short of average to pre strike levels 
transit delays in the bosporus  which tightened availability of aframaxes in late and early with a positive effect on rates  were largely resolved by the second quarter  resulting in increased availability of suitable tonnage and an easing in rates 
aframax freight rates dropped from congestion inflated highs of  per day in the first quarter  to an average of  per day in the second quarter 
in the third quarter  the russian baltic sea terminal of primorsk was expanded and its feeder pipeline capacity increased  allowing larger amounts of oil to be exported 
an anticipated early october increase in russian crude export duties prompted some charterers to take cargoes earlier than initially planned 
these events and generally improving employment opportunities boosted average rates to  per day in the third quarter 
seasonally scheduled maintenance by us refiners from late august through mid september had a softening effect on aframax rates 
conditions changed abruptly when a series of hurricanes struck the us southeast 
cargo operations in the us gulf were disrupted  infrastructure was damaged and a significant amount of production was shut down 
crude oil imports into the us were increased in the fourth quarter to compensate for the lost production and  as a result  aframax freight rates reached a high of  per day  rate levels never reached before 
the world aframax fleet increased to vessels million dwt as of december  from vessels million dwt at december  aframax deliveries fell to vessels million dwt in from vessels million dwt in demolitions fell to vessels million dwt in from vessels million dwt in the contrast in demolition volumes between the aframax and vlcc sectors reflects the greater impact of imo regulations governing the phase out of single hull tonnage on the aframax fleet 
rising newbuilding prices slowed the pace of aframax ordering to vessels million dwt  from record levels of vessels million dwt in as ordering outweighed deliveries  the aframax orderbook expanded to vessels million dwt at december   equivalent to  based on deadweight tons  of the existing aframax fleet 
foreign flag product carrier segment spot market tce rates panamaxes in the pacific and bostonmaxes in the caribbean q q q q panamax average      panamax high      panamax low      bostonmax average bostonmax high      bostonmax low      rates for panamax product carriers in the pacific region averaged  per day in  higher than the average for  and more than double the average for non oecd asia  led by india  has been the focal point for an expansion in refinery capacity in  leading to further expansion in intra asian products trade 
similarly  china s massive economic expansion and its burgeoning oil requirements have indirectly boosted product trades in the surrounding non oecd asia region 
countering these developments  to some extent  was the gradual restoration of japan s nuclear power capacity from s safety crisis  reducing japan s dependence on oil fired power generation and its need for fuel oil imports 
the rise in freight rates in the first quarter relative to the prior and comparable year ago quarter  was largely attributable to shipping delays and congestion in the mediterranean 
these problems were caused by a four day outage at an algerian refinery and the temporary shutdown of the suez canal due to severe weather 
chinese gas oil imports also rose strongly during this period 
following a seasonal dip from  per day in the first quarter to  per day in the second quarter  average freight rates built steadily to  per day in the final quarter of in addition to the temporary reversion to oil fired power generation at some plants in the third quarter  due to unexpected outages  japan experienced unusually hot summer weather  which further raised consumption of fuel oil 
these factors and storms in the far east helped to support freight rates even as china s imports of products declined as a result of government efforts to slow the economy and limit electricity usage 
the fourth quarter led to a revival in chinese demand  including a pickup in product imports 
the world panamax product carrier fleet at december  increased to vessels million dwt from vessels million dwt at december  in  panamax deliveries totaled vessels million dwt  a significant increase from the vessels million dwt delivered in meanwhile  scrap sales slowed to vessels million dwt in from vessels million dwt the previous year 
the orderbook at december  increased to vessels million dwt  equivalent to  based on deadweight tons  of the existing panamax fleet 
scrappings of panamax product carriers in  as a result of the impact of imo regulation g are expected to mitigate the impact of scheduled deliveries 
rates for bostonmax product carriers operating in the caribbean averaged  per day in  higher than in and higher than in us petroleum product imports were higher than in  based on preliminary data  boosted by several factors 
new legislation requiring high specifications for key products such as gasoline in major consuming states constrained domestic output and excluded certain short haul refiners from the us market 
us gasoline demand was strong in just about every quarter in  while demand for diesel oil and jet fuel was generally strong as well 
the severe hurricane season in forced refinery operations on the gulf coast to shut down for several weeks in the third and fourth quarters  providing further support for increased product imports 
western europe s increasing use of diesel oil for its automotive fleet resulted in substantial exportable surpluses of high specification gasoline 
as a result  us product imports from western europe increased by in the first eleven months of  compared with the same period in  while us product imports from the arabian gulf were also up 
in addition  a healthy backhaul movement of gasoil to europe limited quality tonnage in the caribbean 
the world handysize product carrier fleet which includes bostonmax product carriers expanded to vessels million dwt at december  from vessels million dwt at december  deliveries in increased to vessels million dwt from vessels million dwt in  and scrappings in decreased to vessels million dwt from vessels million dwt in at december   the newbuilding orderbook for handysize product carriers reached vessels million dwt  equivalent to  based on deadweight tons  of the existing handysize fleet 
outlook the underlying factors which sent freight rates to much higher levels in will likely continue to have a positive influence in the pattern of volatility in freight rates experienced in is also expected to continue in because of the closely balanced tanker markets 
world economic growth is expected to moderate slightly from  but remain strong 
global oil demand  according to the international energy agency  is expected to rise a further in following the exceptionally large increase in developing economies in asia will likely continue to be the primary growth engine 
the total tanker fleet in is forecast to grow by compared with in  as a sizable number of newbuilding deliveries is expected to be partially offset by rising deletions  many of which are mandated under imo phase out regulations 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates in the application of its accounting policies based on the best assumptions  judgments  and opinions of management 
following is a discussion of the accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and the methods of their application 
for a description of all of the company s material accounting policies  see note a to the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item revenue recognition the company generates a majority of its revenue from voyage charters 
within the shipping industry  there are two methods used to account for voyage charter revenue and expenses ratably over the estimated length of each voyage and completed voyage 
the recognition of voyage revenues and expenses ratably over the estimated length of each voyage is the most prevalent method of accounting for voyage revenues and expenses and the method used by osg 
under each method  voyages may be calculated on either a load to load or discharge to discharge basis 
in applying its revenue recognition method  management believes that the discharge to discharge basis of calculating voyages more accurately estimates voyage results than the load to load basis 
since  at the time of discharge  management generally knows the next load port and expected discharge port  the discharge to discharge calculation of voyage revenues and expenses can be estimated with a greater degree of accuracy 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  osg does not begin recognizing voyage revenue until a charter has been agreed to by both the company and the customer  even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage 
vessel lives and impairment the carrying value of each of the company s vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation calculated using an estimated useful life of years from the date such vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard 
in the shipping industry  use of a year life has become the standard 
the actual life of a vessel may be different 
the company has evaluated the impact of the revisions to marpol regulation g that become effective april  and the new eu regulations that went into force on october  on the economic lives assigned to the tankers in the company s foreign flag fleet 
because the osg foreign flag tanker fleet comprises mainly modern  double hull vessels  the revised regulations only affect one wholly owned vessel and two vessels currently held in joint ventures 
current regulations will not require any of these single hull or double sided foreign flag tankers  except the front tobago  to be removed from service prior to attaining years of age  although the trading of such vessels after could be affected 
the revised imo regulation g allows the flag state to permit the continued operation of our single hull and double sided tankers beyond because such regulations do not explicitly permit single hull and double sided tankers to continue trading beyond  their operation beyond is not assured 
a single hull vlcc  the front tobago  which is owned by osg  will be banned from eu ports beginning in at the age of the company s single hull suezmax will be banned from eu ports in at the age of years 
a owned single hull aframax tanker  compass i  will be banned from eu ports in at the age of years 
because the cost and impact on cargo carrying capacity necessary to have the compass i classed as double sided are minimal and because the company intends to make such changes  the evaluation of the remaining useful life of the vessel and the recoverability of its carrying amount was made on the basis that the vessel was double sided 
osg considered the need to reduce the estimated remaining useful lives of its single hull and double sided foreign flag tankers because of the eu regulations and the revised and accelerated phase out schedule agreed to by imo in december these new regulations will not prevent any of these vessels  with the exception of the front tobago  from trading prior to reaching years of age 
accordingly  the economic life of the front tobago was reduced to in it was not deemed necessary to reduce the estimated remaining useful lives of any of our other single hull or double sided foreign flag tankers 
if the economic lives assigned to the tankers prove to be too long because of new regulations or other future events  higher depreciation expense and impairment losses could result in future periods related to a reduction in the useful lives of any affected vessels 
the carrying values of the company s vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings 
historically  both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical 
the company records impairment losses only when events occur that cause the company to believe that future cash flows for any individual vessel will be less than its carrying value 
the carrying amounts of vessels held and used by the company are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular vessel may not be fully recoverable 
in such instances  an impairment charge would be recognized if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel s carrying amount 
this assessment is made at the individual vessel level since separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available 
in developing estimates of future cash flows  the company must make assumptions about future charter rates  ship operating expenses  and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels 
these assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
we performed an impairment test for our single hull and double sided foreign flag tankers  including vessels held in joint ventures  in december  because of the new eu regulations that became effective in october and the revised and accelerated phase out schedule agreed to by the imo in december for purposes of this analysis  we assumed that the single hull tankers would stop trading in and the double sided tankers would continue trading until age  in accordance with the revised and accelerated phase out schedule adopted by the imo 
we also assumed that these vessels would achieve lower tce rates than comparable double hull tankers over their remaining useful lives 
because voyage charter rates are volatile and vessel values vary over time  a probability weighted approach based on historically observed tce rates was used to estimate future cash flows 
in all cases  the carrying values of the company s single hull and double sided foreign flag tankers as of december  were less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for the respective vessels 
accordingly  no impairment loss was recorded 
we performed an impairment test for our vessels in december because of a decrease in the sales price of second hand vessels  as reported in trade publications  and the downward trend in spot rates that had persisted during and the first nine months of a probability weighted approach based on historically observed tce rates was used to estimate future cash flows 
in all cases  the carrying values of the company s vessels were less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for the respective vessels 
accordingly  no impairment loss was recorded 
market value of marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  the company s holdings in marketable securities are classified as available for sale and  therefore  are carried on the balance sheet at fair value as determined by using period end sales prices on us or foreign stock exchanges with changes in carrying value being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the investments are sold 
accordingly  these changes in value are not reflected in the company s statements of operations 
if  however  pursuant to the provisions of fas and staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company determines that a material decline in fair value below the company s cost basis is other than temporary  the company records a noncash impairment loss as a charge in the statement of operations in the period in which that determination is made 
as a matter of policy  the company evaluates all material declines in fair value for impairment whenever the fair value of a stock has been below its cost basis for six consecutive months 
in the period in which a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of that security is written down to its fair value at the end of such period  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
based on a number of factors  including the magnitude of the drop in market values below the company s cost bases and the length of time that the declines had been sustained  management concluded that the declines in fair value of securities with aggregate cost bases of  in and  in were other than temporary 
accordingly  the company recorded pre tax impairment losses of  in and  in related to such securities 
these impairment losses are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the capital construction fund held a diversified portfolio of marketable equity securities with an aggregate cost basis of  and an aggregate fair value of  there were no equity securities with unrealized losses as of december  see note e to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item for additional information on other pre tax unrealized losses as of december  drydocking within the shipping industry  there are three methods that are used to account for drydockings capitalize drydocking costs as incurred deferral method and amortize such costs over the period to the next scheduled drydocking  accrue the estimated cost of the next scheduled drydocking over the period preceding such drydocking  and expense drydocking costs as incurred 
since drydocking cycles typically extend over two and a half years or longer  management believes that the deferral method provides a better matching of revenues and expenses than the expense as incurred method 
the company further believes that the deferral method is preferable to the accrual method because estimates of drydocking costs can differ greatly from actual costs and  in fact  anticipated drydockings may not be performed if management decides to dispose of the vessels before their scheduled drydock dates 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowance the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is based on the assumption that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to permit the company to take deductions and use tax credit carryforwards 
during  the company recorded a valuation allowance of  related to capital losses arising from the write down of certain marketable securities 
the valuation allowance was established because the company believed that a portion of the capital losses might expire unused because the generation of future taxable capital gains was not certain 
during and  the company reduced the valuation allowance by  and  respectively  reflecting capital gains recognized in and increases in the fair value of securities previously written down and the effect of securities sold in the valuation allowance has been reduced to zero as of december  each quarter  management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
any increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets will result in additional income tax expense in the company s statement of operations 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company has recorded pension and other postretirement benefit costs based on complex valuations developed by its actuarial consultants 
these valuations are based on key estimates and assumptions related to the discount rates used and the rates expected to be earned on investments of plan assets 
osg is required to consider market conditions in selecting a discount rate that is representative of the rates of return currently available on high quality fixed income investments 
a higher discount rate would result in a lower benefit obligation and a lower rate would result in a higher benefit obligation 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is management s best estimate of expected returns 
a decrease in the expected rate of return will increase future net periodic benefit costs and an increase in the expected rate of return will decrease future benefit costs 
with respect to the company s domestic plans  as of december   management reduced the discount rate to from following a reduction to from as of december  and maintained unchanged the expected rate of return on plan assets at 
changes in pension and other postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future as a result of changes in these rates 
certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries have pension plans that  in the aggregate  are not significant to the company s financial position 
special purpose entity spe in  the company facilitated the creation of an spe that purchased from and bareboat chartered back to the company five us flag crude tankers that the company in turn bareboat chartered to alaska tanker company for the transportation of alaskan crude oil for bp 
the purchase price of million was financed by a term loan from a commercial lender and a substantive equity capital investment by the owner of the spe 
the company did not guarantee the vessels residual values or guarantee the spe s debt

the reduction in percentage contribution from long term charters during compared with was principally attributable to significant increases in average tce rates in for vessels operating in the spot market 
reliance on the spot market contributes to fluctuations in the company s revenue  cash flow  and net income loss  but affords the company greater opportunity to increase income from vessel operations when rates rise 
on the other hand  time and bareboat charters provide the company with a predictable level of revenues 
during  income from vessel operations increased by  or  to  from  in the improvement resulted principally from an increase in average daily tce rates and revenue days for vlccs and aframaxes

during  tce revenues for the vlcc segment increased by  or  to  from  in this improvement in tce revenues resulted from an increase of  per day in the average daily tce rate earned and an increase in the number of revenue days 
all but one of the vessels in the vlcc segment participated in the tankers pool as of december  revenue days increased by  principally for the following reasons  partially offset by an increase of drydock and repair days during which vessels were out of service and a reduction of days attributable to the sales of two single hull vessels  the olympia and dundee the delivery of one newbuilding in mid february  the purchase of the built double hull meridian lion  previously held by a owned joint venture  in april  the exchange of joint venture interests see note d to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item  which resulted in the company owning of the dundee  sakura i and tanabe and the inclusion of such vessels in the vlcc segment from the effective date of the transaction  and the participation in the charter in of six vlccs  which commenced between february and september the redemption of the other partner s joint venture interest in the equatorial lion and meridian lion as described in note d and the simultaneous acquisition of the meridian lion from the other partner resulted in the inclusion of both vessels in the vlcc segment from the mid april effective date of the transaction 
the equatorial lion  which had  prior to the completion of this transaction  been time chartered in from the joint venture is now owned by a subsidiary of the company 
vessel expenses increased by  to  in from  in the prior year principally as a result of the vessel additions discussed above 
average daily vessel expenses  however  decreased by per day in compared with principally attributable to decreases in repair expenses and crew costs 
time and bareboat charter hire expenses increased by  to  in from  in as a result of the inclusion of six additional chartered in vlccs  which charters commenced in the company s participation interests in seven time chartered in vlccs  which excludes the charter in of the meridian lion  discussed below  in which the company has a interest as of december   was equivalent to vessels at a weighted average base rate of  per day 
four of the chartered in vlccs provide for profit sharing with the vessels owners when tce rates exceed the base rates in the charters 
in addition  in late june  the company entered into a sale leaseback agreement for one of its vlccs  the meridian lion  which lease is classified as an operating lease 
the gain on the sale was deferred and is being amortized over the eight year term of the lease as a reduction of time and bareboat charter hire expenses

the increase in revenue days resulted principally from the delivery of two newbuilding vlccs one in april and another in mid february and the april purchase of the meridian lion 
vessel expenses increased by  to  in from  in the prior year principally as a result of the equatorial lion becoming wholly owned in april and an increase in ship operating days 
average daily vessel expenses increased by per day in compared with  principally attributable to increases in damage repair expenses and insurance premiums
