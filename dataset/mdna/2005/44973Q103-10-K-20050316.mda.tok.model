item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under certain factors that may affect our future operating results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide software and related services that allow our clients to more effectively manage their contract based  business to business relationships through the entirety of the contract management lifecycle 
we operate our business in two segments health and life sciences and other industries 
the health and life sciences line of business markets and sells our products and services to companies in the life sciences industries  including pharmaceutical and medical product companies  wholesale distributors and managed care organizations 
our other industries line of business targets all other industries  with an emphasis on consumer products  foodservice  disposables  consumer durables  industrial products  chemicals  apparel  and telecommunications 
our primary products and services were originally developed to manage complex contract purchasing relationships in the healthcare industry 
our software is currently licensed by of the largest world wide pharmaceutical manufacturers  ranked according to annual healthcare revenues 
as the depth and breadth of our product suites have expanded  we have added companies in the other industries markets to our customer base 
we have generated revenues from both products and services 
product revenues which through mid had been principally comprised of software license fees generated from our i many cars software suite and now includes licensing of our i many contractsphere enterprise contract management product suite  government pricing and medicaid compliance software  and collection products accounted for of net revenues in and of net revenues in service revenues include maintenance and support fees directly related to our licensed software products  professional service fees derived from consulting  installation  business analysis and training services related to our software products and hosting fees 
service revenues accounted for of net revenues in and of net revenues in from june through march  we implemented a number of employee headcount reductions  which have been partially offset by employee additions through acquisitions and selective hiring  and we have taken other measures to better align our cost structure with projected revenues 
our aggregate spending on sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses has been reduced from million in the quarter ended june  to million in the quarter ended september  and million in the quarter ended december  during and the first quarter of  actions taken to reduce our operating expenses included the closing of our chicago  illinois office  the significant downsizing of our london  england and portland  maine operations and selective other headcount reductions 
our total employee headcount has decreased from employees at december  to employees at december  and employees at december  in december  we announced an agreement to merge our company with selectica  inc for an all cash purchase price to our shareholders of per outstanding share  subject to the approval of our shareholders and other conditions 
to date  all significant conditions to the closing of this sale have been satisfied except for shareholder approval 
the special meeting of shareholders of our company to consider and vote upon the proposed sale is scheduled for march  certain major shareholders have publicly announced their opposition to the merger  and accordingly we cannot assure you that the merger will be approved 
on march  the closing price of our common stock on nasdaq was per share 

table of contents critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
software license revenues are attributable to the addition of new customers and the expansion or renewal of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products and license renewals 
we recognize software license fees upon execution of a signed license agreement and delivery of the software to customers  provided there are no significant post delivery obligations  the payment is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in multiple element arrangements  we allocate the total fee to professional services  training and maintenance and support services based on the fair value of those elements  which is defined as the price charged when those elements are sold separately 
the residual amount is then allocated to the software license fee 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance 
in cases where collection is not deemed probable  we recognize the license fee as payments are received 
service revenues include professional services  training and maintenance and support services and out of pocket reimbursable expenses 
professional service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
if conditions for acceptance exist  professional service revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
for fixed fee professional service contracts  we provide for anticipated losses in the period in which the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
training revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
included in training revenues are registration fees received from participants in our off site user training conferences 
maintenance and customer support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is generally twelve months 
when maintenance and support is included in the total license fee  we allocate a portion of the total fee to maintenance and support based upon the price paid by the customer when sold separately  generally as renewals in the second year 
payments received from customers at the inception of a maintenance period are treated as deferred service revenues and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
payments received from customers in advance of product shipment or revenue recognition are treated as deferred product revenues and recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or when otherwise earned 
substantially all of the amounts included in cost of revenues represent direct costs related to the delivery of professional services  training and maintenance and customer support 
in  we began offering current and prospective customers the option to enter into a subscription agreement as an alternative to our standard license contract model 
the standard subscription arrangement is presently a three year  fixed fee agreement  covering license fees and maintenance and support  payable in equal quarterly installments commencing upon execution of the agreement 
due to the extended payment terms  the installment payments are recognized as product revenue ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
during the year ended december    in revenue was recognized related to such agreements 
we account for consideration given to a customer or a reseller of our products as a reduction of revenue in certain circumstances 
to the extent that cumulative consideration earned by a customer or reseller during a reporting period exceeds revenue earned by the company from the customer or reseller  such excess is reported as sales and marketing expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record provisions for doubtful accounts based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and related credit risks 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the 
table of contents accounts receivables  our historical write off experience  the credit worthiness of customers and the economic conditions of the customers industries and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of the company s future provision for doubtful accounts 
if the assumptions we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future collections  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
the provisions for doubtful accounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
acquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will not be amortized until their lives are determined to be definite 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination  whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets  with the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
deferred tax assets a deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes and loss carry forwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary items are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
product indemnification the company s agreements with customers generally include certain provisions for indemnifying the customer against losses  expenses  and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event that our products are found to infringe upon a patent  copyright  trademark  or other proprietary right of a third party 
the agreements generally seek to limit the scope of remedies for such indemnification obligations in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions and no claims are outstanding as of december  we do not expect that any significant impact on financial position or the results of operations will result from these indemnification provisions 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   while service revenues increased by million or 
the value of license contracts minimum price of  sold during decreased relative to  due primarily to a decrease in average selling price 
product revenues in included the recognition of million in license fees that had been previously deferred in other factors affecting product revenue recognition in were the consummation of several subscription arrangements during and the deferral of million of license fee revenue in connection with three license transactions executed during the fourth quarter of as we work to increase our sales outside the health and life sciences segment in our other industries segment  we believe a similar or larger proportion of our new customers will place conditions on their license purchases that will require us to defer recognition of license revenue until later reporting periods 
we believe that software acceptance testing by new customers  in particular  is a growing trend for customers in the markets we target outside of health and life sciences 
revenues in the health and life sciences segment were million higher in than in  attributable to a million increase in service revenue as we continued to experience a reduced pipeline of sales opportunities in this segment 
as a percentage of total net revenues  revenues derived from our other industries segment were in  as compared to in and in our new products in the i many contractsphere enterprise contract management ecm product suite  which are targeted primarily to customers in the other industries segment  remained in early stage releases  which limited our ability to derive revenues from them 
we continue to believe that  as economic conditions improve and the market for our ecm suite begins to move past an early adopter stage  which we believe to be the general but uncertain trend  as evidenced by the improvement in our sales results in the fourth quarter of  we anticipate corresponding improvement in demand for our newer products 
as a percentage of total net revenues  product revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease in product revenues as a percentage of total net revenues is principally attributable to the reduction in health and life science revenues discussed above 
the million increase in service revenues in was attributable to a million increase in professional services revenue  which was attributable to an increase in large software implementations  and a  increase in maintenance and support revenue  which was attributable to a net increase in the company s fee paying installed customer base 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of payroll and related costs and subcontractor costs for providing professional services and maintenance and support services and  to a lesser extent  amounts due to third parties for royalties related to integrated technology 
historically  cost of product revenues has not been a significant component of total cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  significant reductions in salaries and related costs  attributable to a reduction in technical support and professional services headcount from an average of during to an average of during  partially offset by higher non cash stock compensation costs  accounted for most of the decrease in spending 
as a percentage of total net revenues  cost of revenues increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of total net revenues is attributable to the decrease in product revenues and corresponding increase in 
table of contents service revenues as percentages of total revenues 
service revenues have typically generated lower margins than product revenues  and we believe that this trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefits for sales and marketing personnel  commissions for sales personnel  travel costs  recruiting fees  expenses for trade shows and advertising and public relations expenses 
during  sales and marketing expenses also included a non cash charge of  related to the value associated with the granting of a common stock warrant to procter gamble 
excluding the non cash warrant charge  sales and marketing expense decreased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  significant reductions in salaries and related costs  attributable to a reduction in sales and marketing headcount from an average of during to an average of during  combined with decreased spending for meetings and travel and entertainment  accounted for most of the decrease in spending 
as a percentage of total net revenues  sales and marketing expense excluding the non cash warrant charge decreased significantly to in versus in research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs for development personnel and external consulting costs associated with the development and maintenance of our products 
research and development costs  including the costs of developing computer software  are charged to operations as they are incurred 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  significant reductions in salaries and related costs  attributable to a reduction in development headcount from an average of during to an average of during  partially offset by higher non cash stock compensation costs  accounted for most of the decrease in spending 
as a percentage of total net revenues  research and development expense decreased significantly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in our administrative  finance and human resources departments  insurance costs  and legal  accounting and other professional service fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is principally attributable to reductions in salaries  benefits and related costs  resulting from a decrease in administrative headcount from an average of during to an average of during  and reduced legal and casualty insurance costs  partially offset by higher non cash stock compensation costs and merger costs of  incurred in connection with the proposed merger with selectica 
as a percentage of total net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  depreciation 
depreciation expense decreased by  or  to  in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to significant levels of computer  software and related equipment acquired in and becoming fully depreciated in and also  property and equipment with a net book value of  was written off during the first quarter of  further reducing the depreciable asset base 
since the annual property and equipment additions during the and timeframe million and million  respectively were significantly higher than the software and equipment additions in  and  this reduction in annual depreciation expense is expected to continue into amortization of other acquired intangible assets 
amortization of other acquired intangibles related to our acquisitions amounted to million in the year ended december   which represents a decrease of  or  from the amortization of million in this decrease is attributable to the discontinued amortization of acquired intangibles for chi cor information management  inc chicor and bcl vision ltd 
bcl  pursuant to full impairment asset write offs in june 
table of contents in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of pricing analytics  inc pricing analytics in april  we allocated  of the total purchase price to in process research and development  which was expensed upon consummation of the acquisition 
this allocation was based on an independent appraisal conducted for the purpose of allocating the initial consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this allocation was attributable to one in process research and development project  which consisted of the development of significant new features and functionality to an existing software product 
pricing analytics had achieved significant technological milestones on the project as of the acquisition date  but the project had not reached technological feasibility 
at the time of the acquisition  the project was approximately to complete 
the company invested approximately  in the project following the acquisition 
the project s development progressed  in all material respects  consistently with the assumptions that the company had used for estimating its fair value 
the project was completed in october impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
in  we incurred impairment charges of million with respect to acquired intangible assets and million with respect to goodwill  in connection with our acquisitions of chicor and bcl 
no such charges were incurred during terminated deal transaction costs 
in  we incurred million in deal related transaction costs in connection with the proposed sale of our health and life sciences business to neoforma  inc no such charges were incurred during restructuring and other charges 
in connection with the reduction of our leased space in london  england and the significant reduction in our portland  maine operation  as part of our efforts to reduce operating expenses and consolidate operations  we wrote off  in future lease obligations and recognized  in equipment impairment charges during the year ended december  also  we incurred severance costs of  for employees whose employment was terminated during as part of this downsizing effort and incurred  in ongoing restructuring charges related to the chicago  illinois office that was closed in in  we wrote off  in future lease obligations and recognized  in equipment impairment charges in connection with the closing of our offices in chicago and india and the downsizing of our london operation 
also  we incurred severance costs of  for employees whose employment was terminated during as part of this downsizing effort  and we recorded a  charge representing the write down in value of various property and equipment assets 
other income  net other income  net  increased by  or  from  in the year ended december   to  in the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to an increase in interest income  which resulted from higher interest rates during income taxes in  we recorded an  benefit arising from a refund related to the carry back of an operating loss to a pre acquisition fiscal period for our subsidiary based in the united kingdom 
other than this carried back benefit  we incurred operating losses for all quarters in and and have consequently recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset  which consists principally of our net operating loss carryforwards  as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
no provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenues decreased by million  or 
table of contents  to million for the year ended december   accounting for substantially all of the decrease in net revenues as service revenues had increased by million 
the number of license contracts minimum price of  sold decreased by from to  accounting for the decrease in product revenues 
as a percentage of total net revenues  revenues derived from outside the health and life sciences segment were in  as compared to in and in meanwhile  revenues in the health and life sciences segment were million less than in the reduction in health and life sciences segment revenues was due primarily to a reduced pipeline of sales opportunities in this segment 
we believe this decrease resulted from the reluctance of our target customers to make information technology expenditures during the recent economic downturn  which lengthened sales cycles and reduced the number and quality of sales opportunities available to us 
we also believe that the aborted neoforma transaction  which was announced in july and terminated in december  had a negative impact on new product sales into the health and life sciences market for most of the second half of the year  due to perceived uncertainty about the future of these products and their support 
finally  in our new products in the i many contractsphere enterprise contract management product suite remained in development or in early stage releases  which limited our ability to derive revenues from them and hindered our ability to reduce our reliance on our older products 
as a percentage of total net revenues  product revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease in product revenues as a percentage of total net revenues is principally attributable to the reduction in health and life science revenues discussed above 
the million increase in service revenues in was due to a million increase in maintenance and support revenue  which was attributable to a net increase in the company s fee paying installed customer base  partially offset by a  reduction in professional services revenues 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a million increase in subcontractor consulting costs  partially offset by a  reduction in travel expenses as compared to approximately million of the increase in subcontractor costs was related to our decisions to outsource support and hosting activities related to certain of the company s products 
much of the balance of the subcontractor cost increase represents the non recurring impact of delayed hiring decisions within the professional services organization that were a consequence of neoforma s planned acquisition of our health and life sciences business segment 
as a percentage of total net revenues  cost of revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of total net revenues is attributable to the decrease in product revenues and corresponding increase in service revenues as percentages of total revenues  and to the increase in subcontractor costs discussed above 
service revenues have typically generated lower margins than product revenues  and we believe that trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
excluding the non cash warrant charge in related to the value associated with granting a common stock warrant to procter gamble  sales and marketing expense decreased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  significant reductions in sales and marketing headcount employees at december  versus at december  combined with a more than percent decrease in commissionable product revenues were the principal reasons for a million decrease in salaries and commission expenses and a  decrease in travel expenses

in the quarter ended june   we determined that an interim test for impairment to the company s goodwill and other acquired intangible assets was necessary pursuant to the july announcement of the proposed sale of our health and life sciences business to neoforma 
in conjunction with the proposed sale to neoforma  we made plans to reduce our workforce and focus our near term development efforts primarily on our product offerings in the i many contractsphere enterprise contract management product suite 
the consequent de emphasis on the technologies originally acquired in the acquisitions of chicor and bcl and the corresponding reduction in 
table of contents projected sales of the related products had resulted in the determination that future cash flows were not sufficient to support the valuations of the chicor and bcl long lived assets 
as a result of our assessment  the company recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  associated with our acquisitions of chi cor and bcl 
these impairment charges were recorded in the other industries reportable segment and included impairment of goodwill totaling million and of other acquired intangible assets totaling million

in addition  we recorded a  charge representing the write down in value of various property and equipment assets during the quarter ended march  unrelated to the restructuring of operations 
in  we recorded a  charge which represented a write off of the net carrying value of our investment in tibersoft corporation  a privately held technology company 
other income  net other income  net  decreased by  or  from  in the year ended december   to  in the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to a decrease in interest income  which resulted from lower average cash balances and reduced interest rates during income taxes we incurred operating losses for all quarters in and and have consequently recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset  which consists principally of our net operating loss carryforwards  as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
no provision or benefit for income taxes has been recorded for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources on february   we completed a private placement of common stock  preferred stock and warrants  resulting in our receipt of million in gross proceeds 
of this amount  million  representing the purchase price of the preferred stock  was held in an escrow account pending conversion of the preferred stock into common stock 
at our election  the million in preferred stock was redeemed on july  in and  we entered into several capital lease financing arrangements with a financial institution 
under the terms of the financings  the aggregate proceeds of million were deposited in a restricted bank account 
at december    of the remaining aggregate proceeds were restricted  all of which is classified as current restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet 
the non current restricted cash balance of  at december  represents cash amounts held on deposit as security on two long term lease obligations 
at december   we had net working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
also on december   we had no long term or short term debt  other than obligations under capital lease financings 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities consisted of the net loss of million  as offset by the following non cash items which total million depreciation and amortization of million  restructuring and other charges of million  in process research and development of  and non cash warrant  option and stock charges of million 
other uses of cash included a million decrease in accrued expenses  which was principally comprised of i million in lease and severance payments related to downsized facilities and employee severances  ii  reduction in the accrual related to discontinued self funded employee insurance programs  and iii  decrease in accrued consulting and professional service fees 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities consisted of the net loss of million  as offset by the following non cash items which total million depreciation and amortization of million  impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets of million  restructuring and other charges of million  and non cash warrant  option and stock charges of million

net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december   mostly comprised of payments on existing capital leases and an increase in restricted cash 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions for at least the next months 
our future long term capital needs will depend significantly on the rate of growth of our business  possible acquisitions  the timing of expanded product offerings and the success of these offerings if and when they are launched 
accordingly  any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our current balance of cash and cash equivalents is insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity needs  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities to raise funds  and those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
in connection with such a sale of stock  our stockholders may experience dilution 
in addition  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all

table of contents certain factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we will need to grow in markets other than the healthcare market for our future growth we will need to be successful in our efforts to reduce our reliance on the health and life sciences market  which has traditionally been the primary source of our revenues 
revenues from our non healthcare customers have comprised  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and the company must continue to evolve its products and marketing strategies in order to be successful in these markets 
we have not been successful in generating the revenue we expected from these markets and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the future 
although we have had some success in selling to markets outside of healthcare  we have not yet demonstrated that our product offerings have significant appeal in many of the markets we are targeting 
the bid price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market has been below per share  and if the bid price again falls below per share for an extended period  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to raise additional necessary capital in april we received written notification from nasdaq that we were not in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule b because the closing bid price of our common stock was below for consecutive trading days 
we subsequently regained compliance when the bid price of our common stock closed at per share or more for consecutive trading days 
this process occurred again in september  when we received a similar notice of deficiency  and for which we regained compliance in november if the closing bid price of our common stock again falls below per share for consecutive trading days and we do not regain compliance  we would be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
the delisting of our common stock may result in the trading of the stock on the nasdaq smallcap or the otc bulletin board 
consequently  a delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market may reduce the liquidity of our common stock  adversely affect our ability to raise additional necessary capital and could adversely affect our sales efforts 
we have incurred substantial losses in recent years and our return to profitability is uncertain we incurred net losses of million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december   and we had an accumulated deficit at december  of million 
our recent results have been impacted by a number of factors that caused current and prospective customers to defer  or otherwise not make  purchases from us  and we cannot assure you that we will not be affected by these or other factors in future periods 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve sufficient revenues to become profitable in the future 
it is difficult for us to predict when or if sales will occur and we often incur significant selling expenses in advance of our recognition of any related revenue our clients view the purchase of our software applications and related professional services as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  clients carefully evaluate our software products and services 
the length of this evaluation process is affected by factors such as the client s need to rapidly implement a solution and 
table of contents whether the client is new or is extending an existing implementation 
the license of our software products may also be subject to delays if the client has lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes which are quite common in the context of introducing large enterprise wide technology solutions 
we may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a client s evaluation period  including the costs of developing a full proposal and completing a rapid proof of concept or demonstration  before the client places an order with us 
clients may also initially purchase a limited number of licenses before expanding their implementations 
larger clients may purchase our software products as part of multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions  which may result in additional unplanned administrative processing and other delays in the recognition of our license revenues 
if revenues forecasted from a significant client for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed  as has occurred in recent quarters  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues during that quarter 
this may cause our operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the value of our common stock to decline 
our fixed costs have led  and will continue to lead  to fluctuations in operating results which have resulted  and could in the future result  in a decline of our stock price a significant percentage of our expenses  particularly personnel costs and rent  are fixed costs and are based in part on expectations of future revenues 
we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any significant fluctuations in revenues 
accordingly  shortfalls in revenues  as we experienced in recent quarters  may cause significant variations in operating results in any quarter 
our stock price has been impacted by the failure of our quarterly results to meet the expectations of market analysts and investors  and it could decline further 
we have multiple facilities and we may experience difficulties in operating from these facilities we will continue to operate out of our corporate headquarters in edison  new jersey  our primary engineering office in redwood city  california and facilities in portland  maine and london  england 
the geographic distance between our offices makes it more difficult for our management and other employees to collaborate and communicate with each other than if they were all located in a single facility  and  as a result  increases the strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
also  a significant number of our sales and professional services employees work remotely out of home offices  which will potentially add to this strain 
we may not be successful in developing or acquiring new technologies or businesses and this could hinder our expansion efforts we intend to continue our product research and development efforts at levels similar to current expenditures and to consider additional acquisitions of or new investments in complementary businesses  products  services or technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our product development efforts or we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition or investment candidates 
even if we do identify suitable candidates  we cannot assure you that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms 
furthermore  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and the issuance of debt could limit our available cash and accordingly restrict our activities 
we may make additional acquisitions and we may have difficulty integrating them any company that we acquire will have a culture different from ours as well as technologies  products and services that our employees will need to understand and integrate with our own 
we have assimilated the employees  technologies and products of the companies that we have previously acquired and will need to do the 
table of contents same with any new companies we may acquire  and that effort has been  and will likely continue to be difficult  time consuming and may be unsuccessful 
if we are not successful  our investment in the acquired entity may be impaired or lost  and even if we are successful  the process of integrating an acquired entity may divert our attention from our core business 
if we do acquire new technologies or businesses  our results of operations may be adversely affected in connection with our acquisitions  we have recorded substantial goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
in addition  we recorded charges for write offs of a portion of the purchase prices of acquired companies as in process research and development 
the carrying values of intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the years ended december  and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  in connection with the write off of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
we cannot assure you that future write downs of any such assets will not affect future operating results 
we have many competitors and potential competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively the market for our products and services is competitive and subject to rapid change 
we encounter significant competition for the sale of our contract management software from the internal information systems departments of existing and potential clients  software companies that target the contract management markets and professional services organizations 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of products and services offered 
we anticipate increased competition for market share and pressure to reduce prices and make sales concessions  which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and margins 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees and strategic partners 
our competitors could develop products or services that are equal or superior to our solutions or that achieve greater market acceptance than our solutions 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
we may not be able to compete successfully  and competitive pressures may require us to make concessions that will adversely affect our revenues and our margins  or reduce the demand for our products and services 
we rely significantly upon certain key individuals and our business will suffer if we are unable to retain them we depend on the services of our senior management and key technical personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of a 
leigh powell  our chief executive officer  and other key employees 
the loss of the services of any key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields 
table of contents without assuming significant risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting primarily of short term investment grade securities 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe there is no material risk exposure 
a change in interest rates  either positive or negative  would not have had a significant effect on interest income in the years ended december   and as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents consisted entirely of money market investments with remaining maturities of days or less when purchased and non interest bearing checking accounts 
investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than days and less than one year are classified as short term investments

at december   the company had million of held to maturity investments that consisted of three us government agency securities and two corporate bonds 
under current investment guidelines  maturities on short term investments are restricted to one year or less
