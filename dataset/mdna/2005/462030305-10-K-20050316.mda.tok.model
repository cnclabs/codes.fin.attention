item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview iomega designs and markets products that help customers protect  secure  capture and share their valuable digital information 
the company s reportable segments are based primarily on the nature of the company s products and include zip products  sourced branded products  rev products which began shipping in april and network storage systems nss 
since  the zip product segment has been  by far  the largest contributor to the company s sales and product profit margin ppm 
as the zip business has approached the end of its product life cycle  the company has been trying to find other profitable sources of revenue to replace the declining high gross margin zip business 
this has been challenging for the company 
in recent years  the company invested significant efforts and dollars on the development of two new technologies rev products and the digital capture technology dct program 
during  the company launched its new rev products 
rev products generated million of new sales in  but were not profitable due to significant development  start up and marketing launch costs 
the company elected not to launch any dct products  due in part to a determination that the company lacked the resources to simultaneously pursue the dct technology and rev products 
the company subsequently licensed the dct technology to a third party  incurred impairment and other charges and sold some of its dct assets for a net gain of million see the dct program license agreement  impairment charges and related asset sales discussion for more detail on the activities related to winding down the dct program 
in other efforts to replace the declining zip business  the company has developed and launched a variety of products  none of which were commercially successful 
in addition  the company has launched and attempted to expand its sourced branded and nss businesses 
during  for the first time  sales of the sourced branded business segment exceeded zip product sales 
however  the company s sourced branded segment does not generate high gross margins and the segment has never been profitable for an entire year 
moreover  the nss business has also incurred losses each year 
thus  the zip product segment remains the company s only consistently profitable segment 
in light of the inevitable decline of the zip business  the company will not be viable unless it generates significant ppm from products other than zip products 
rev products currently represent the company s most realistic opportunity to develop a significant ppm stream which could at least partially offset the rapidly declining zip ppm 
management expects to continue to invest significant resources with the goal to increase rev product sales 
it is unlikely that the company will be able to operate profitably unless and until rev products generate significant positive ppm 
however  the company can provide no assurance that the rev business will generate ppm sufficient to offset declining zip ppm 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued for  the company s primary goals are to significantly grow rev product sales  continue to grow sourced branded sales  gross margin percentage and ppm and closely monitor overhead costs and operating expenses with the key objective to make the overall business profitable 
the company can provide no assurance that it will achieve these goals 
the company continues to work on several cost initiatives related to improving sourced branded gross margins  including the continued transition to a regional assembly process and optimizing the supply chain 
during  the company recorded million of restructuring charges to align the company s cost structure with its expected future revenue levels 
during  it is imperative that the company achieve the anticipated sales growth from both rev and sourced branded products to achieve its goals 
at december   the company s total cash  cash equivalents and temporary investment balance was million see the liquidity and capital resources discussion for more detail on the tax impacts of repatriating foreign cash 
the company believes its total cash is sufficient to operate the business for at least one year 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments occur include  but are not limited to revenue recognition  price protection and rebate reserves  inventory valuation reserves  accrued excess purchase commitments  tax valuation allowances and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued revenue recognition the company defers recognition of sales on estimated excess inventory in the distribution  retail and catalog channels 
for this purpose  excess inventory is the amount of inventory that exceeds the channels four week requirements as estimated by management 
original equipment manufacturers oems and value added resellers vars customers are not considered to have excess inventory as they usually do not carry more than four weeks of inventory 
the distribution  retail and catalog channels four week requirements are estimated based on inventory and sell through amounts reported to the company by the company s key customers  who make up the substantial majority of the company s sales in these channels 
no adjustment is made for those customers that do not report inventory and sell through information 
the company defers estimated sales and cost of sales associated with estimated excess channel inventory in its consolidated financial statements 
this inventory and sell through information is reported to the company at the stock keeping unit sku level 
however  for purposes of the excess inventory calculation  this information is accumulated at the major product level ie zip mb drive  zip mb drive  etc 
the company uses the last weeks of reported sell through information to calculate a weekly average  which is then used to estimate the channels four week requirements 
this estimate may not be indicative of four weeks of future sell through 
the company defers sales and cost of sales associated with estimated excess channel inventory in the consolidated statements of operations  with the resulting offset being reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in margin on deferred revenue 
the table below shows the related revenue and cost of sales deferrals associated with the estimated excess channel inventory 
december  in thousands deferred revenue deferred cost of sales margin on estimated channel inventory the decrease in margin on estimated channel inventory during reflects lower levels of channel inventory and product mix changes away from high margin zip products 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to excess channel inventory are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the variability of the different inputs to the calculation of the reserve such as changes in the level of channel inventory and channel sell through rates and the material impact that changes in these inputs can have on sales  cost of sales and margin on deferred revenue 
excess channel inventory is a critical estimate for all segments of the company s business 
since the company has no material debt and adequate cash balances  the company believes that changes in excess channel inventory accruals would not impact the company s liquidity 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued price protection and rebate reserves the company has agreements with some of its direct and indirect customers which  in the event of a price decrease  allow those customers subject to certain limitations a credit equal to the difference between the price originally paid and the new decreased price on units in the customer s inventory on the date of the price decrease not to exceed the number of units shipped to the customer for a specified time period prior to the price decrease 
when a price decrease is anticipated  the company establishes reserves against gross trade receivables with the corresponding reduction in sales for estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers 
in addition  the company records reserves at the time of shipment for estimated volume rebates and other estimated rebates given to consumers at the time of purchase from channel partners for which sales have been recognized 
estimates for rebates are based on a number of variable factors that depend on the specific program or product 
these variables include the anticipated redemption rate of rebates  anticipated sales volumes in the channel  the perceived consumer value of the rebate and historical experience 
changes in any of these variables would have a direct impact on the amount of the recorded reserves 
the company uses price protection and rebate programs in all of its segments and the statement of operations charges are recorded against their respective segment 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to price protection and rebate programs are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the assumptions made concerning redemption rates and other variables and changes in this reserve can have a material impact on sales and trade receivables 
price protection and rebate reserves have fluctuated in the past 
for example  during  million of price protection and rebate reserves that were recorded in prior periods were released as they were not claimed as originally estimated 
reserves for volume and other rebates and price protection totaled million at december  and million at december  and are netted against trade receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
the decrease in this reserve for was primarily a reflection of lower rebate and price protection programs during relative to the lower sales in the company believes that the use of rebates will continue to be a significant part of the company s business strategy 
since the company has no material debt and adequate cash balances  the company believes that changes in price protection and rebate accruals would not impact the company s liquidity 
inventory valuation reserves the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices including known future price decreases 
the company includes product costs and direct selling expenses in its analysis of inventory realization 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed such costs and expenses  valuation reserves are established against inventories 
in addition  the company generally considers inventory which is not expected to be sold within established timelines  as forecasted by the company s material requirements planning system  as excess and thus appropriate inventory reserves are established through a charge to cost of sales 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued the company believes that the accounting estimates related to inventory valuation reserves are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due primarily to estimating future sales volumes of products and future sales prices  the competitive nature of the technology industry which can quickly change the price of the company s products in the market place or the overall demand for the company s products and changes in the value of inventory can have a material impact on cost of sales and inventory valuation reserves 
inventory valuation reserve adjustments are necessitated primarily from changes in estimating future sales volumes and from changes in the estimates made of future sales prices 
estimating future sales volumes is particularly difficult for new products and end of life eol products 
estimating future sales price is particularly difficult on sourced branded products due to price competition and short product cycles 
zip products have shown a long market life compared to the company s other products 
in light of their high margins  its inventory carrying value has been recoverable at estimated selling prices 
consequently  zip products have not  until recently  been as susceptible to inventory valuation reserve adjustments as some of the company s other products 
now  as zip products reach the end of their product life cycle  zip products and components have become susceptible to excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
if zip volumes decline at a quicker rate or in greater volumes than forecasted  the risk associated with inventory valuation reserves will increase 
during  the company recorded a net decrease in inventory valuation reserves of million 
the million decrease was comprised of additions of million less utilization of million as reserved product was scrapped or sold 
the million addition to inventory valuation reserves was comprised of million for zip products  million for sourced branded products and million for nss  with the remaining million for other various products 
the million zip charge resulted primarily from purchased eol components which exceeded the eol volume forecast 
the million sourced branded product charge resulted primarily from product priced below cost in order to move the inventory 
the million of nss charge resulted primarily from additional nas and tape product write offs in early related to the announcement in late regarding the discontinuance of the high end of the market nas servers and tape products 
the million inventory reserve utilizations were primarily for zip  source branded and nas products as product was sold or scrapped 
during  the company recorded a net increase in inventory valuation reserves of million which was recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
this million net increase was comprised of an addition of million to the inventory valuation reserves which was partially offset by million in inventory reserve utilizations as product that had been previously reserved was sold or scrapped 
the million addition to the inventory valuation reserves was comprised of million for zip products  million for sourced branded products and million for other products primarily nas and jaz products 
the million zip write off was primarily for the reserve of inventory components previously purchased which exceeded estimated needs 
the million write off for sourced branded products primarily resulted from the continued price declines necessary to sell sourced branded products 
the million write off for other products primarily related to the discontinuance of the high end of the market nas servers and excess jaz inventory 
the million of inventory reserve utilizations was primarily for peerless  zip and sourced branded products 
as the company continues to offer new products or exits product lines  there is no assurance that further inventory valuation reserves will not be required 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued at december   the company had inventory valuation reserves of million  which compares to inventory valuation reserves of million at december  the decrease in inventory valuation reserves during was primarily attributable to decreases in reserves as described above 
adjustments to the inventory reserves are a non cash adjustment and would not affect the company s liquidity 
accrued excess purchase commitments the purchase orders under which the company buys many of its products generally extend one to three quarters in the future 
the quantities on the purchase orders are based on forecasted future sales requirements 
it is difficult to estimate future product demand for new products or products with declining sales 
such estimates may result in excess purchase commitments  where the company makes commitments for purchases that the company does not ultimately utilize 
the accrual for excess purchase commitments also includes liabilities such as cancellation charges or handling fees incurred because of excess supplier inventory or equipment 
with the continued declines of zip volumes  this has become an area of particular risk for the company 
suppliers of certain critical components of both zip drives and disks have stopped producing  or eol d such components and other suppliers are planning to do so 
in such cases  the company attempts to make an eol purchase of the required component s based on its estimates of all future requirements 
with respect to estimating excess purchase commitments  the company is at risk that it will order insufficient or excess quantities of key components or that certain suppliers may produce excess inventory of key components in the absence of firm orders from iomega  leading to potential disputes regarding payment obligations 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to accrued excess purchase commitments are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due primarily to estimating future sales volumes of products  the inherit difficulty of estimating future requirements or final build out of components that have been eol d by the supplier and decisions to discontinue projects with suppliers 
during  the company recorded a net decrease in excess purchase commitment reserves of million 
this decrease was comprised of million of additions less utilization of million 
the majority of the million increase resulted from zip product exposures at the company s manufacturing suppliers as a result of decreases in the eol forecast 
the million utilizations resulted primarily from zip and sourced branded products as much of what was utilized came from prior reserves and was primarily paid to suppliers  product was moved into inventory or reserves reduced due to increases in forecast demand 
during  the company recorded a net increase in excess purchase commitment reserves of million 
this increase was comprised of million of additions less utilization of million 
of the million of additions  million related to zip products  primarily for zip head stack assembly supplier exposures as the recent eol forecast used for head stack component build out was significantly less than previous projections and for commitments resulting from the consolidation of zip media manufacturers  million related to sourced branded products supplier commitments  primarily for asia pacific region dvd products where demand was not as expected  with the remaining million for eol additions related to various other products 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued the accrual for excess purchase commitments totaled million at december  and million at december  since the company has no material debt and adequate cash balances  the company believes that changes in accrued excess purchase commitments would not impact the company s liquidity 
tax valuation allowances statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas requires that a valuation allowance be established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and valuation allowances are provided or released  as necessary 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its forecasts of income in conjunction with other positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
adjustments to the valuation allowance will increase or decrease the company s tax provision or benefit 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provision benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheet 
for example  during  the company recorded a million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from new foreign tax credits and decreases in deferred tax liabilities 
included in the million increase in the valuation allowance was an million increased valuation allowance resulting from new foreign tax credits created by deemed swiss withholding taxes on foreign earnings 
the recording of the new foreign tax credits was the result of a change in the company s intention to repatriate foreign cash to the us in the form of dividends in the future 
the valuation allowance was also increased as the result of a decrease in the deferred tax liability of million resulting from a decrease in the pool of unrepatriated foreign earnings 
during  the company increased its valuation allowance by million  primarily as a result of its evaluation of the realizability of its increased state net operating loss carryforwards nols deferred tax assets  which were adjusted in conjunction with the completion of an irs audit 
adjustments to deferred tax valuation allowances are non cash adjustments and do not affect the company s liquidity 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the company has million of goodwill  all of which is associated with the zip product segment 
the company also has million of other intangible assets  primarily a licensing agreement and intellectual property that is also entirely associated with the zip product segment 
as zip product segment sales and profits continue to decline  the risk increases that the million of goodwill and the million of other intangible assets will become impaired and that impairment charges will become necessary 
the company 
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued performs its annual impairment test required under sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets sfas in the first quarter of each year 
each quarter  the company compares how actual quarterly profits are tracking with the projected profits that were used in the annual impairment test to make sure that there has not been a significant adverse change in business climate or that an unforeseen trend has developed 
as part of this quarterly review  the company also looks for any other indicators of impairment  such as any significant adverse changes in legal factors  adverse regulatory assessments or loss of key personnel 
there were no indicators of impairment from the time the impairment evaluation was performed in the first quarter of to december  the company believes that the accounting estimates related to assessing potential impairment of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets are critical accounting estimates because the subjectivity inherent in determining the fair value of the zip product segment and the impact that future impairment charges will have on the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining estimated useful lives for the company s other intangible assets range approximately from one half to one and one half years 
as zip sales and profits continue to decline  the company anticipates that the zip goodwill may start to become impaired in late or early one of the intangible assets will be fully amortized in and the other will be fully amortized in the second quarter of future impairment charges will be non cash charges and will not affect the company s liquidity

seasonality the company s sourced branded business is typically strongest during the fourth quarter 
the company s european sales are typically weakest during the third quarter due to summer holidays 
given the continued expected decline of the zip business  the company is unable to estimate or forecast any zip product seasonality in future quarters with any degree of confidence 
there can be no assurance that any historic sales patterns will continue and  as a result  sales for any prior quarter are not necessarily indicative of the sales to be expected in any future quarter 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dct program license agreement  impairment charges and related asset sales as the company has previously disclosed  its dct business plan was dependent upon adoption of significant consumer electronics oems 
unfortunately  the company was not successful in securing oem commitments 
during the second quarter of  the company investigated the possibility of bringing the dct technology to market as a stand alone computer peripheral storage device 
however  based on the company s analysis and objective evaluation of the market environment in which the dct technology would compete  the company concluded that it did not have sufficient resources to simultaneously pursue the opportunities of the dct technology and rev products 
consequently  the company decided not to launch an iomega branded pc peripheral dct device and began winding down the dct program during the third quarter of as part of the wind down activities  the company determined that fixed assets related solely to the dct program were impaired and thus during recorded as cost of sales  million of impairment charges 
this million charge was attributable entirely to the new technologies business segment 
the fair value of the assets was determined based on industry knowledge and from the disposition of similar assets in the past 
during  the company also recorded million of other charges for cancelled commitments  comprised primarily of supplier claims  for equipment and parts that had been committed to by both the company s suppliers as well as second tier suppliers 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a definitive license agreement regarding its dct intellectual property 
the license agreement terms included an upfront cash payment of million to the company and an additional million cash payment to the company at a later date based upon the licensee s commercialization date of the technology but no later than november further  the license agreement calls for potential royalties to be paid on future products utilizing the technology up to million 
the million is reflected in the operating expenses section of the consolidated statement of operations under the caption  license fees  as the cash has been received and the company has fulfilled all of its obligations related to that payment 
the company will not recognize the million in its financial statements until the related cash payment is received 
there is no guarantee that the company will receive any future payments from this transaction 
during the license agreement negotiations  the company also entered into other agreements  including the sale of various fixed assets  primarily testing equipment and miscellaneous engineering equipment that iomega had used as part of the dct program 
the company received million of cash for these assets resulting in a gain of million

the million increase in sourced branded product sales was comprised from increases of million in hdd drives  million in iomega mini and micro mini usb flash drives  million in floppy external drives and million in dvd rewritable drives  partially offset by a million decrease in cd rw drive sales 
the company began selling dvd rewritable and external floppy drives late in the first quarter of the company anticipates continued future declines in cd rw drive sales  primarily due to the fact that almost all new pcs include an internal cd rw drive and the transition from cd rw drives to dvd rewritable drives 
higher overall sourced branded product unit volumes excepting cd rw drives were partially offset by lower prices on all sourced branded products 
the company anticipates continued competitive pricing pressure on all of its sourced branded products

no tier one oems have adopted rev technology and the company can provide no assurance that any will do so 
nss sales represented of total sales for  compared to for the higher sales in were primarily due to the company s strategy to concentrate on the entry level and low end markets as well as related new product introductions that occurred during with the goal to continue growing nss sales  in  the company plans to leverage rev market penetration into nss sales and increase the focus on additional easy to use software functionality

the zip product gross margin percentage increased in primarily from million of restructuring charges recorded in partially offset by certain eol material charges recorded in total zip product gross margin dollars decreased due to significantly lower zip product sales 
the company anticipates that future zip product gross margin percentage will fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter as zip product sales continue to decline 
sourced branded product gross margins declined both in terms of dollars and percentages during  primarily from intense price competition on mini usb flash drive products  increased costs due to transitioning to a regional assembly process for its sourced branded products and the company s first half plan to lower margins on certain sourced branded products in an attempt to gain greater retail penetration in the us market 
the company s goal is to improve sourced branded product gross margins during through completing the transition to the regional assembly process  other purchasing and supply chain improvements and a continued focus on variable costs 
rev gross margins were initially burdened with product start up costs but steadily improved in as volumes increased 
future gross margin percentages will depend on a number of factors including the future sales volume of zip and rev products  achievement of rev and sourced branded product sales and gross margin goals  pricing actions or promotions  the mix between zip products compared to sourced branded  rev and nss products  sales mix between aftermarket and oem or private label channels  as oem and private label sales generally provide lower gross margins than sales through other channels  sales mix of zip mb  mb and mb drives and disks  as sales of the various zip products have differing gross margins  sales volumes of zip disks  which generate significantly higher gross margin percentages than the corresponding drives  the impact of rising zip manufacturing costs and eol material charges  the impact of supply chain improvements on

zip ppm as a percentage of zip product sales increased to for from for  primarily from the higher gross margin percentages as described above and from lower operating expenses reflecting the benefits of the and restructuring actions 
the company anticipates that future zip ppm will decline quarter after quarter as the technology reaches the end of its life cycle 
with the continuing decline in zip product sales  it becomes increasingly difficult for the company to manage component supplies  manufacturing schedules and zip product inventory at distributors and retailers  thus increasing the risk of future charges

the company can provide no assurance that its activities in this regard will be successful or that it will ever operate this business profitably 
the rev product loss was attributable to manufacturing start up costs  high marketing launch expenses  research and development expenses for completing the development of the current rev products and research and development expenses for the next generation rev products 
the rev product loss as a percentage of rev product sales was a negative 
it is the company s goal to continue improving rev ppm as volumes increase and make this a profitable segment 
however  the company intends to continue to spend considerable resources generating awareness of this new product and developing the next generation rev products and the company can provide no future assurance regarding rev operating results 
the improved nss ppm in resulted primarily from lower costs reflecting the company s re orientation of the nss product line during the fourth quarter of and high sales and marketing and research and development spending in when the company was attempting to broaden the nss product offering by entering into the high end of the market

the company does not anticipate fully realizing the cost savings from the restructuring actions until the second quarter of despite the million decrease in compared to  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales stayed flat at for both years  as sales declined at a faster rate than overall selling  general and administrative costs and the company incurred significant marketing costs associated with the launch of the new rev products

income taxes for  the company recorded a net income tax provision of million  on a pre tax loss of million 
the net tax provision was comprised of a million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from new foreign tax credits and decreases in deferred tax liabilities  partially offset by the statutory tax benefit of million on the pre tax loss and million of tax benefits primarily from the release of tax accruals 
for  the company recorded a net income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the net income tax benefit was comprised of the statutory tax benefit of million on the pre tax loss  a benefit of million for additional research tax credits and a net million of miscellaneous favorable tax adjustments  partially offset by a charge of million relating to an increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
the realizability of the net deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly in accordance with sfas  which requires that a valuation allowance be established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
during  the company recorded a million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from new foreign tax credit nols 
included in the million increase in the valuation allowance was an million increased valuation allowance resulting from new foreign tax credits created by deemed swiss withholding taxes on foreign earnings

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued in the company s intention to repatriate foreign cash to the us in the form of dividends in the future 
the valuation allowance was also increased as the result of a decrease in the deferred tax liability of million resulting from a decrease in the pool of unrepatriated foreign earnings 
the company has recorded tax contingencies related to items in various countries  which are included in other accrued liabilities and in deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
these reserve balances will be adjusted to the extent that these items are settled for amounts different than the amounts recorded 
the amount included in other accrued liabilities at december  related to such tax contingencies was million 
during  the company reversed a tax contingency of million to the benefit provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations  due to changes in estimates about the future requirement of these reserves 
on april   in conjunction with releasing its first quarter pre tax results  the company announced that it was conducting an analysis of its net tax assets and associated valuation reserves 
at the completion of the analysis  the company concluded that foreign withholding taxes which were previously presented as income taxes receivable should be reclassified and reported as deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the amount reclassified on the december  consolidated balance sheet was million 
the company also determined that an additional balance sheet reclassification of million was necessary to reclassify certain other accrued liabilities to current deferred income taxes 
the company further concluded that no net adjustment was required to the fourth quarter tax provision as a result of certain fourth quarter offsetting adjustments related  in part  to the tax consequences of a million intercompany dividend required to fund the one time per share cash dividend paid to shareholders on october  the company also concluded that no adjustments to the tax provisions were required in any other prior period 
during  the company established an additional valuation allowance totaling million for a portion of its us deferred tax assets primarily related to state nols 
after considering its forecasts of taxable income in conjunction with other positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred tax assets  the company concluded that a partial valuation allowance should be recorded against the net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of during  the company s decision to sell its penang manufacturing subsidiary necessitated the recording of a tax provision during the third quarter of for the company s foreign earnings that were previously considered permanently invested in non us operations 
this resulted in an additional deferred us tax liability of million 
this provision was partially offset by the release of million of valuation allowance for a net provision of million in the third quarter of the release of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets resulted from the company no longer being in a net deferred tax asset position 
the resulting net deferred tax liability position was primarily due to the million provision on the company s foreign earnings that were previously considered permanently invested in non us operations 
during  the company recorded a total million decrease in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets which was comprised of the million decrease in valuation allowance described above related to the sale of the penang manufacturing subsidiary and a million decrease resulting primarily from a reduction in net deferred tax assets associated with us nols 
the reduction in nols was primarily the result of the passage of the job creation and worker assistance act of  which allowed for a year carryback and utilization of a portion of the company s tax net operating loss 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
they are measured by applying the enacted tax rates and laws in effect for the years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
the following table summarizes us and foreign loss and tax credit carryforwards as of december  amount expiration dates in thousands us and foreign loss deferred tax assets federal nols  to state nols  to foreign nols  to indefinite capital losses tax credit deferred tax assets foreign tax credits  to indefinite research credits  to alternative minimum tax credits  indefinite at december   the company had million of deferred tax assets related to us federal net nols  which reflect a tax benefit of approximately million in future us federal tax deductions 
at december   the company had million of deferred tax assets related to state nols  which reflect a tax benefit of approximately million in future state tax deductions 
the difference in the amount of future federal and state tax deductions related to the nols is primarily attributable to two factors the difference between federal and state nol carryback rules which have allowed the use of federal nols in instances where state nols could not be utilized and the difference in the taxable portion for federal and state purposes of dividends received from the company s foreign subsidiary

income taxes for  the company recorded a net income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the net income tax benefit was comprised of the statutory tax benefit of million on the pre tax loss  a benefit of million for additional research tax credits and a net million of miscellaneous favorable tax adjustments  partially offset by a charge of million relating to an increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets

the million additional provision resulted from the sale of the company s penang manufacturing subsidiary 
during  the company established an additional valuation allowance totaling million for a portion of its us deferred tax assets primarily related to state nols 
after considering its forecasts of taxable income in conjunction with other positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred tax assets  the company concluded that a partial valuation allowance should be recorded against the net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of during  the company s decision to sell its penang manufacturing subsidiary necessitated the recording of a tax provision during the third quarter of for the company s foreign earnings that were previously considered permanently invested in non us operations 
this resulted in an additional deferred us tax liability of million 
this provision was partially offset by the release of million of valuation 
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued allowance for a net provision of million in the third quarter of the release of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets resulted from the company no longer being in a net deferred tax asset position 
the resulting net deferred tax liability position was primarily due to the million provision on the company s foreign earnings that were previously considered permanently invested in non us operations 
during  the company recorded a million decrease in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets which was comprised of the million decrease in valuation allowance described above related to the sale of the penang manufacturing subsidiary and a million decrease resulting primarily from a reduction in net deferred tax assets associated with us nols 
the reduction in nols was primarily the result of the passage of the job creation and worker assistance act of  which allowed for a year carryback and utilization of a portion of the company s tax net operating loss 
at december   the company had million of deferred tax assets related to us federal nols  which reflect a tax benefit of approximately million in future us federal tax deductions 
at december   the company had million of deferred tax assets related to state nols  which reflect a tax benefit of approximately million in future state tax deductions 
the difference in the amount of future federal and state tax deductions related to the nols is largely the result of differences between federal and state nol carryback rules which have allowed the use of federal nols in instances where state nols could not be utilized 
net deferred tax liabilities for the company at december  were million

in any event  the amount of cash required for us federal and state taxes will be less than the company s effective tax rate due to the availability of existing federal and state nols and tax credit carryforwards 
on october   the president of the united states signed the ajca 
a provision of the ajca allows companies to repatriate funds held by foreign based subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate under certain circumstances 
see the income taxes discussion in the section above entitled as compared to for more detail 
the decrease in working capital resulted primarily from lower cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments  lower trade receivables and lower current deferred income taxes  partially offset by higher inventories  lower other accrued liabilities  lower accrued restructuring charges  lower income taxes payable  lower accounts payable  lower accrued payroll  vacation and bonus and lower excess purchase commitments 
the primary uses of cash from operations in were million for the product loss associated with the completion of development  launch and follow on development of rev products  million for restructuring disbursements and million for the payment of annual management bonus plans and changes in current assets and current liabilities as described below 
trade receivables decreased in primarily from lower sales 
days sales outstanding dso in receivables improved from days at december  to days at december   primarily due to the timing of sales during the fourth quarter of dso is calculated by multiplying the period end trade receivables balance by and dividing that amount by the sales for the quarter ended of the applicable year 
current deferred income taxes decreased primarily due to lower current asset reserves and an increased valuation allowance primarily resulting from new foreign tax credits and decreases in deferred tax liabilities 
inventories increased during primarily from rev products which began shipping early in sourced branded and nas product inventories also increased during to support higher sales levels  but were offset by lower zip product inventories as previously built up zip product has been sold 
other current liabilities decreased primarily from the release of various accruals for a european subsidiary for which operations have ceased and lower sales  vat and other tax accruals 
accrued restructuring decreased due to a net utilization of the accruals see the section above entitled  restructuring charges reversals for more detail on the accrual utilization 
accrued payroll  vacation and bonus accruals decreased primarily from the lower headcounts resulting from the restructuring actions and from lower bonus accruals 
income taxes payable decreased due to the release of tax accruals associated with the company s foreign operations 
accounts payable decreased due to lower purchases reflecting the lower sales volumes and operating costs 
it is the company s goal to reverse the negative cash flows from operations through completing the implementation of the restructuring actions  further improving of rev product sales and margins  improving the financial results of the sourced branded business  profitably growing the nss business and managing the zip products business for cash flow 
however  the company can give no assurance that it will be successful in achieving any of these goals 
during  the company did not repurchase any shares of the company s common stock

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued million stock repurchase plan authorized by the company s board of directors on september  the repurchase plan does not have a fixed termination date 
the company believes that its balance of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments  together with cash flows from future operations  will be sufficient to fund anticipated working capital requirements  funding of restructuring actions  capital expenditures and cash required for other activities for at least one year 
however  cash flow from future operations  investing activities  and the precise amount and timing of the company s future financing needs cannot be determined 
future cash flow will depend on a number of factors  including those set forth in the section labeled factors affecting future operating results 
should the company be unable to meet its cash needs from its current balance of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments and future cash flows from operations  the company would most likely incur additional restructuring charges to adjust the company s expenditures to a level that its cash flows could support and or seek financing from other sources 
the company s current balance of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments is its sole source of liquidity 
given the company s history of sales declines and losses  there is no assurance that  if needed  the company would be able to obtain financing from external sources or obtain a competitive interest rate

these purchase obligations include those contracts that the company can terminate for its convenience on advance written notice to the supplier 
the company conducts a substantial portion of its operations from leased facilities 
aggregate lease commitments under non cancellable operating leases are shown in the table above

off balance sheet arrangements guarantees during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a limited guarantee for up to million with a contract manufacturer 
the company will guarantee payments for purchases made by the company s asian distribution and logistics service provider on behalf of the company 
the distribution and logistics service provider is making these purchases to fulfill orders in the company s asia pacific region 
all purchase orders placed by the distribution and logistics service provider are based on forecasts provided by the company 
this guarantee will remain in effect until approximately june  the company will only make payments under this guarantee in the event that the distribution and logistics service provider is in material payment default 
however  if the distribution and logistics service provider defaulted on payment to the contract manufacturer  the company would be entitled to withhold any related amounts due by the company to the distribution and logistics service provider or its parent company 
the company has recorded a thousand liability to reflect the fair value of this guarantee 
the fair value was based on the estimated market value of a similar stand alone letter of credit

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other matters recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas  which amended accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
sfas was issued primarily to improve the comparability of accounting for inventory costs with the international accounting standards board 
sfas clarifies the definition of normal capacity and states that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  wasted materials  etc 
should be recognized as current period charges as opposed to being capitalized as inventory overhead 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  though early adoption is encouraged 
as the company is already in compliance with this standard  it has adopted sfas as of january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r provides accounting guidance for stock based payments to employees 
sfas r revises sfas by eliminating the choice of using the recognition and measurement provisions of apb no 
and requiring all companies to use the fair value method of measuring stock compensation expense 
sfas r clarifies and expands sfas s guidance in several areas  including measuring fair value  classifying an award as equity or a liability  attributing compensation cost to reporting periods as well as adding several new disclosure requirements 
sfas r also changes the accounting for the tax effects of options  including the presentation of the tax effects on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas r is effective for public companies with the first interim or annual period that begins after june  as discussed above  the company is currently accounting for all of its stock based compensation under the fair value method as outlined in sfas and will adopt sfas r beginning in the third quarter of the company still needs to evaluate the impacts of sfas r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas was issued primarily to improve the comparability of accounting for exchanges of nonmonetary assets with the international accounting standards board 
sfas requires that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
apb opinion no 
had some exceptions to measuring exchanges at fair value 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   though early adoption is encouraged 
the company rarely enters into nonmonetary asset exchanges so the impact of sfas will be minimal 
the company has adopted sfas for any nonmonetary asset exchanges that occur after january  regulatory developments the sarbanes oxley act of the act imposed many requirements regarding corporate governance and financial reporting 
one requirement under section of the act  beginning with this form k  is for management to report on the company s internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accountants to attest to such report 
on november   the sec issued an exemptive order providing an optional day extension for the filing of these section reports and attestations by eligible companies 
the company has elected to utilize this day extension and  therefore  this form k does not include these reports 
these reports will be included in an amended form k to be filed on or before may  during  the company spent considerable time and resources analyzing  documenting and testing its system of internal controls  which includes the internal controls of third parties to whom the company has outsourced certain operations 
a significant factor leading to the company s decision to utilize the day extension was the failure of its third party distribution and logistics service provider to timely provide a written  audited report on its internal controls this report being known as a sas report 
the sas report  which was not provided to iomega until march   revealed that our service provider has certain deficiencies in its internal controls 
the company and its auditors are reviewing the sas report and evaluating the company s compensating and redundant controls that were put in place in to minimize  and to eliminate in certain areas  the company s reliance on the third party s internal control environment 
in addition  the company is also finalizing its overall evaluation of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
as of the date of this report  based upon the company s compensating and redundant controls with respect to the third party service provider and our overall evaluation  the company has not identified any material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting 
however  the company is continuing to evaluate i our service provider s deficiencies and ii the company s controls over the extensive use of spreadsheets by our accounting staff in conducting financial analyses 
these issues  or others  could result in the determination of a material weakness in the final evaluation and preparation of the company s section report 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results demand for the company s products and operating efficiencies the company s future operating results will depend upon its ability to generate sufficient market demand and presence for its products to allow it to operate profitably in an industry characterized by intense competition  rapid technological advances and low margins 
the company s ability to accomplish this will depend on a number of factors  including the following worldwide market conditions in general and demand for digital storage products in particular  the company s ability to replace rapidly declining zip revenues and profits with revenues and profits from other products  particularly the company s new rev products  the company s ability to generate significant sales and ppm from its rev products  which will require successful marketing and considerable oem adoption of those products  the company s ability to improve its sourced branded business gross margin percentage and to operate this business unit profitably  price  performance  quality and other characteristics of the company s products and of competing and substitute products in an extraordinarily competitive industry  success of the company in meeting targeted availability dates for new and enhanced products  the company s ability to provide and maintain customer service and satisfaction  the company s ability to profitably and efficiently manage its supplies of products and key components  the company s ability to maintain profitable relationships with distributors  retailers and other resellers of the company s products  the company s ability to maintain an appropriate cost structure and to minimize unforeseen and extraordinary expenses  the company s ability to attract and retain competent  motivated employees  public perception of the company and its products  including statements made by industry analysts or consumers and adverse publicity resulting from such statements or from litigation filed against the company  the company s ability to comply with applicable laws  regulations  ordinances and other legal requirements in the numerous countries in which it does business and the company s ability to successfully manage litigation  including enforcing its rights  protecting its interests and defending itself from claims made against it 
the company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to successfully manage  satisfy or influence any of these factors 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued zip drives and disks zip products have provided the company s only meaningful source of ppm for the past three years and have accounted for the vast majority of the company s sales and ppm since zip product sales have declined consistently and significantly on a year over year basis  both in terms of unit volumes and sales dollars see the zip product discussion in the section above entitled  sales 
these declines are irreversible  they will continue and likely accelerate  through the end of the zip product lifecycle  due to the obsolescence of zip technology  declining retail and oem demand for zip products and the emergence of alternate means for storing  sharing and transporting large data files 
consequently  the company will not be viable unless it generates significant ppm from products other than zip products 
the company has been unable to do this for several years and can provide no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 
the company is attempting to manage the zip business so as to maximize cash flow and profits for as long as possible  in order to allow the company to develop additional revenue streams 
however  the company continues to lose shelf space for zip products with its key resellers and retailers because of reduced volumes 
oem sales  which were once a significant channel for zip sales  are declining rapidly and the availability of zip products as configure to order options is being discontinued by leading oems 
with declining volumes  it becomes increasingly difficult for the company to manage component supplies  manufacturing schedules and zip product inventory at distributors and retailers 
in addition  the company no longer has the ability to leverage demand for its zip products into demand for other products 
it has also become very difficult to forecast zip product demand from quarter to quarter with any accuracy 
all of these challenges will continue for the remainder of the zip product life cycle 
as zip product segment sales and profits continue to decline  the risk increases that the million of goodwill associated with the zip product segment will become impaired and that impairment charges will become necessary 
the company has performed the impairment test required under sfas and has determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
there were no indicators of impairment from the time the impairment evaluation was performed to december  however  as zip sales and profits continue to decline  the company anticipates that the zip goodwill may start to become impaired in late or early in light of the above factors  the company can offer no assurance that it will be able to maintain profitable operations on its zip business in any subsequent quarter or year

the company s current rev products consist of a drive in external usb  firewire  scsi and internal atapi  sata and scsi versions  removable cartridges with a native capacity of gb and up to gb compressed and a rev based autoloader which holds one drive and ten cartridges 
the company is also developing additional rev based products 
in the current environment  the rev product line represents the company s most realistic opportunity to develop a significant ppm stream which could at least partially offset the rapidly declining zip ppm 
nevertheless  the company s introduction of rev products entails numerous risks  including risks relating to factors such as the following inability to create product awareness and any associated failure to achieve the rev product sales and ppm goals  lack of market acceptance  failure to achieve significant oem adoption of the products  unforeseen manufacturing  technical or supplier delays or issues  quality issues or component supply issues  performance  quality or other issues that are only discovered in the context of usage by large numbers of end users  lack of relevant core competencies or market expertise  intense competition from substitute and strongly entrenched technologies  significant product launch and sales and marketing expenses which could cause on going product losses and risks that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against new products 
it is unlikely that the company will be able to operate profitably unless and until rev products generate significant positive ppm 
although the company has qualified rev internal drives with smaller oems  the company believes that the ultimate commercial success of rev products is dependent upon significant tier one oem adoption and acceptance 
although the company has made significant efforts in this area  the company currently has no tier one oem rev customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully resolve any of the preceding challenges  problems or risks and generate significant ppm from its rev business 
sourced branded products the company ships a variety of sourced branded products finished products which contain little or no iomega intellectual property and are procured from third party suppliers  except for the final assembly on certain products 
these include cd rw drives  dvd rewritable drives  external hard drives  iomega mini and micro mini usb flash drives and external floppy drives 
unlike its zip business  the company s sourced branded products business has never provided a significant source of ppm 
there are a number of material differences between the sourced branded and zip businesses  including the following a in most cases  the company s sourced branded products are functionally identical to numerous other products available in the marketplace  b the company owns very little significant intellectual property relating to its sourced branded products  c there is intense competition between different manufacturers and providers of sourced branded products  d there is a need to continually requalify new drives  products and suppliers as existing drives and 
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued products come into short supply or become obsolete and e in the case of cd rw  dvd rewritable and external floppy disk drives  these drives use very low cost  non proprietary discs disks available from many sources  unlike zip drives 
the overall sourced branded products business is characterized by low and frequently negative gross margins  end user price reductions  the frequent introduction of new products and or performance upgrades for existing products and intense competition from both brand name and generic  low cost competitors 
one or more of these factors could result in the company having to write down the value of its inventory with respect to its sourced branded products 
in order to successfully compete  the company must accurately forecast demand and closely monitor its inventory levels  product transitions  sales channel inventory  purchase commitments  advertising and other marketing expenses in order to compete effectively and profitably 
the company must also secure quality products  meet aggressive product price and performance targets  create market demand for its particular brand of products and hold sufficient  but not excess  inventory 
finally  the company must maintain shelf space with retailers who carry the company s products 
there is no assurance that the company can consistently achieve these objectives and historically it has failed to do so 
since the company entered the optical market in and began sourcing products from other third party suppliers  the company has reported product losses on its optical and the sourced branded business as a whole every year through in spite of these challenges  the company believes it must maintain a presence in the various sourced branded products markets in order to achieve its overall objective to be viewed as a full line supplier of digital mobile and desktop storage products for the company s retail  catalog and online customers 
the company s goal is to operate its sourced branded business profitably 
to that end  its sourced branded products business activities are focused on reducing product costs and operating expenses  improving inventory management processes  receiving more favorable contract terms  enforcing contract rights  improving product life cycle management and revising channel marketing programs with the ultimate goal to achieve profitability or to minimize product losses 
the company can provide no assurance that its activities in this regard will be successful 
the suppliers  as the original manufacturers  have certain competitive advantages over the company in the marketplace  including the ability at any time to sell substantially identical drives at significantly lower prices than the company 
moreover  as the company s revenues decline  it becomes increasingly difficult for the company to obtain favorable contract terms with product suppliers 
there are other risks associated with shipping sourced branded products 
such products may infringe another party s protected intellectual property  may lack adequate quality or may otherwise expose the company to liabilities which could exceed the profits or even the revenues that the company would recognize from selling such products 
the company has implemented a regional assembly process by which certain sourced branded products undergo final assembly in various worldwide locations 
this process is intended to increase efficiency by allowing the company greater flexibility to respond to demand for products while reducing inventory requirements 
there can be no assurance that the regional assembly strategy will achieve its stated objectives 
in addition  the regional assembly strategy creates supply and quality risks 
in summary  the company can provide no assurance that it will be able to successfully manage any of the risks set forth above or achieve sustainable profitability on these products 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued network storage systems in  the company introduced a line of nas servers 
the nas market is dominated by large computer providers including dell and hewlett packard with resources far in excess of the company s  is highly price competitive  primarily relies upon vars to resell the products and requires core competencies in server  software  systems integration and networking technologies 
in  the company incurred start up expenses relating to nas product qualification  launch and customer support in excess of its expectations 
during  the company recorded product losses in excess of million in its nss operations due to under absorbed operational overhead due to lower than planned volumes and from higher sales and marketing and research and development spending designed to broaden the company s nss product offerings 
the company has not yet demonstrated an ability to consistently operate profitably in this market  with the exception of the second quarter of  the company has recorded nss product losses in every quarter since it established this segment 
the company focuses on the entry level and low end markets  where it attempts to leverage its small to medium sized business customer base and channel customers  including existing vars already focused on these customers 
however  the company has not yet successfully developed  nor can the company provide any assurance that it will successfully develop  the necessary core competencies to successfully compete in this market segment 
consequently  the company can provide no assurance that its nas products will be successful or that the company will ever achieve significant or consistent profitability on this product line 
development and introduction of new products and new revenue streams in light of the rapid technological advances and competitive nature of the data storage industry  the company believes that it must continually either develop or acquire the right to sell new products that are profitable in order to remain viable 
however  the company s efforts in this regard have frequently been unsuccessful 
during  and  the company invested significant resources in developing and launching new products  including peerless  pocketzip  hipzip  fotoshow and microdrive products 
the company was unable to sell any of these products profitably and no longer markets any of these products 
in  the company introduced additional sourced branded products including desktop and portable hdd drives and iomega mini usb flash drives as well as nas servers 
in  the company introduced rewritable dvd drives and external floppy disk drives 
with the exception of the external floppy disk drive  the company has not been able to maintain profitable operations on any of the other sourced branded products  for any sustained period of time 
the company has spent significant resources developing two new high capacity removable storage devices  referred to as rev products discussed above and dct technology see the section above entitled dct program license agreement  impairment charges and related asset sales 
the company launched its rev products but never launched any dct products 
in addition  the company expects to evaluate new sourced branded products and to review new business opportunities in multiple areas including digital storage  software  disks  networking  data security  services and other related areas 
the company is spending significant resources attempting to develop technologies and new products  including follow on and next generation rev products 
the company may spend additional resources attempting to acquire the rights to new technologies or to fund development of such technologies 
the company can provide no assurance that it will succeed in any of these endeavors or that any of these expenditures will result in products or technology which the company can profitably sell or license 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued internal control reporting compliance efforts under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the company is required to include in its annual report a report on internal controls 
these new rules are effective for the company for the year ending december  the company has outsourced much of its operations  including its manufacturing  distribution  logistics and collections functions 
as a result  the company is dependent upon the internal controls of these and other outsourcing partners 
the company tries to reduce this risk through the use of compensating or redundant controls at the company 
the company also requires a written  audited report from its key outsourced service providers this report being known as a sas report on their internal controls 
however  our distribution and logistics services provider failed to timely provide its sas report 
when that report was provided to the company on march   it revealed that our service provider has certain deficiencies in its internal controls 
the company and its auditors are reviewing the sas report and evaluating the company s compensating and redundant controls existing as of december  to minimize  and to eliminate in certain areas  the company s reliance on the third party s internal control environment 
in addition  the company is also finalizing its overall evaluation of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
as of the date of this report  based upon the company s compensating and redundant controls with respect to the third party service provider and our overall evaluation  the company has not identified any material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting 
however  the company is continuing to evaluate i our service provider s deficiencies and ii the company s controls over the extensive use of spreadsheets by our accounting staff in conducting financial analyses 
these issues  or others  could result in the determination of a material weakness in the final evaluation and preparation of the company s section report 
further  the company is at risk that any future failure of its own internal controls or the internal controls at any of its outsourcing partners could result in a material weakness of the company s internal controls and or have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
general economic conditions the company s future operating results are subject to risks associated with general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
any disruption in consumer confidence or general economic conditions including those caused by acts of war  terrorism or other factors could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
collection risks although the company uses commercially reasonable steps to manage the credit granted to its customers  certain trade receivable balances from one or more of its customers may become uncollectible 
this event could adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company may be required to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts in the future 
the company anticipates continued challenges in this area 
this trend could have an adverse effect upon the company 
the company has outsourced certain collection functions and is therefore reliant upon third party service providers for such collection activities 
any failure of the third party service provider to perform adequately or any dispute between the company and the service provider could have an adverse effect upon the company 
company operations the company has experienced and may in the future experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
moreover  because the company s expense levels including budgeted selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses are based  in part  on expectations of future sales levels  a shortfall in expected sales could result in a disproportionate adverse effect on the company s net income and cash flow 
in addition  in light of the company s declining revenues and recent operating losses  it is becoming increasingly difficult for the company to negotiate favorable pricing  supply  business or credit terms with its vendors  suppliers and service providers  in some cases existing vendors  suppliers and service providers have begun imposing more stringent terms or even eliminating credit altogether 
the company anticipates continued challenges in this area until and unless the company is able to maintain consistently profitable operations 
the company can offer no assurance that it will ever do so 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued inventory management management of the company s inventory levels is complex 
the company s customers frequently adjust their ordering patterns in response to factors such as the following inventory supplies in the retail and distribution channel  new product introductions  seasonal fluctuations  company and customer promotions  consolidation of customer distribution centers and customer and market demand for the company s products and perceptions of the company s ability to meet demand 
customers may increase orders during times of shortages  cancel orders if the channel is filled with currently available products or delay orders in anticipation of new products 
excess inventories could force the company to reduce prices  write down such inventory or take other actions which in turn could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
product procurement the company has fully outsourced all manufacturing and has no direct control over the manufacturing processes of any of its products  and the company s ability to quickly increase or decrease production rates is limited 
in addition  the company s lack of control over its manufacturing processes may increase the risk that quality or reliability problems may arise with respect to its products  the company has incurred increased product and operational costs  and it may incur additional product and operational costs in the future 
zip and rev products are each manufactured by a single manufacturer  which creates certain risks for the company  including risks of disruption in the supply of zip and rev products in the event of labor  quality or other problems at the zip or rev product manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully manage these risks 
distribution and logistics the company in recent years has outsourced its distribution and logistics centers 
during first quarter  the company entered into separate agreements with a global provider of logistics services and a global provider of reverse logistics services with the goal to consolidate its worldwide distribution  logistics and reverse logistics requirements with as few prime contractors as possible 
consequently  the company is reliant upon the computer systems and business processes of its outsourcing partners and logistics services providers 
the company faces risks that these systems may have communication  control or reliability problems including new processes on both the company s and the new logistics provider s systems and new interfaces on both parties systems 
in addition  the company faces risks of operational interruptions  missed or delayed shipments and inventory management risks in conjunction with its transition to a new logistics provider 
the company faces risks of additional disruption in light of the relocation of one distribution facility late in the fourth quarter of and the planned relocation of an asian distribution facility in since the first quarter transition to the new distribution and logistics service providers  the company has 
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued experienced operational disruptions due to some of these factors 
the company hopes to realize cost savings and operational efficiencies with its transition to the new logistics provider 
however  the company can give no assurance that any cost savings or operational efficiencies will result from this consolidation 
a number of additional problems may occur in any distribution outsourcing relationship  including problems relating to product availability  supply  distribution  handling  shipping  quality or reliability 
such problems  if they were to arise with respect to the company s outsourced operations  could have an adverse effect in the form of a lower company sales  income and or gross margin  b damage to the company s reputation in the marketplace  resulting in decreased demand for or acceptance of the company s products or c damage claims filed against the company by customers  contract partners or investors as a result of such problems 
reporting of channel inventory and product sales by channel partners the company defers recognition of sales on estimated excess inventory in the distribution  retail and catalog channels 
for this purpose  excess inventory is the amount of inventory that exceeds the channels four week requirements as estimated by management 
in order to make this estimation  the company relies on its global channel partners weekly reporting of channel inventory and product sales by sku 
errors in reports received from channel partners could lead to inaccurate estimates of the excess channel inventory 
the company has processes and systems checks in place to help reasonably ensure the accuracy of the reports and believes these reports to be correct in all material respects 
however  there can be no assurance that the third party data  as reported  will always be correct and reliable 
obsolescence risks the company s ability to effectively manage obsolescence risks will affect its operating results 
the company may terminate its marketing of certain products from time to time in response to market demand  supply  cost  competition or other factors 
this requires the company to carefully manage a number of issues  such as a maintaining market demand for the terminated product while successfully selling existing inventories through the channel  b reserving sufficient  but not excessive  quantities of product to comply with warranty  customer satisfaction and legal obligations and c preventing  to the extent possible  the return of such products from inventories held by distributors  retailers and other resellers 
there is no assurance that the company can successfully manage these factors 
component supplies although the company has fully outsourced its manufacturing  the company has retained responsibility for the supply of certain key components 
the company has experienced difficulty in the past  and may experience difficulty in the future  in obtaining a sufficient supply of many key components on a timely and cost effective basis 
many components incorporated or used in the manufacture of the company s products are currently available only from single source suppliers or from a limited number of suppliers and are purchased by the company without guaranteed supply arrangements 
as zip product volumes have declined  multiple suppliers have imposed component price increases and the company has incurred eol material charges  which increases the overall cost of the zip products and this trend is expected to continue 
should rev product volumes not ramp significantly  the company may experience similar component cost increases  eol issues and other component availability challenges 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of components on a timely and cost effective basis 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued the company s inability to obtain sufficient components and equipment or to obtain or develop alternative sources of supply for any product could have a number of adverse consequences  such as the following the company might be unable to produce sufficient quantities of its products to satisfy market demand  the company might be forced to delay product shipments  the company s material costs might increase  thereby reducing product gross margins and the company could experience an imbalance in the inventory levels of certain components  which could increase costs  slow or stop production or cause the company to modify the design of its products to use a more readily available component  with uncertain consequences 
any or all of these problems could in turn result in the loss of customers  provide an opportunity for competing products to achieve market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
the purchase orders under which the company buys many of its components and sourced products generally extend one to three quarters in the future 
the quantities on the purchase orders are based on forecasted future sales requirements 
it is difficult to estimate future product demand for new products or products with declining sales 
such estimates may result in excess purchase commitments  where the company makes commitments for purchases that the company does not ultimately utilize 
the company has recorded significant charges in the past relating to excess purchase commitments and inventory reserves 
the company may be required to take similar charges attributable to forecasting inaccuracies in the future 
intellectual property risks patent  copyright  trademark or other intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted against the company at any time 
such claims could have a number of adverse consequences  including an injunction against current or future product shipments  a requirement that the company pay royalties to a third party in order to continue to market and distribute one or more of the company s current or future products  a requirement that the company pay royalties to third parties for past product shipments  a requirement that the company devote unplanned resources to developing modifications to its products or marketing programs  a requirement that the company indemnify third parties who have distributed the infringing product with the company s permission 
the company must routinely review and respond to claims from third parties for patent royalties  both on products designed or sold by the company and products designed and supplied to the company by third parties 
resolution of patent infringement demand letters and lawsuits can be very costly  with legal fees and costs running into the millions of dollars 
the company attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through a variety of means  including seeking and obtaining patents  trademarks and copyrights  and through license  nondisclosure and other agreements 
the company s failure to properly protect its intellectual property rights could have devastating consequences 
although the company has  in general  been successful in its efforts to protect its intellectual property rights  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued legal risks the company has entered into multiple agreements  including service  supply  resale  distribution  development and other agreements in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company is also subject to an array of regulatory and compliance requirements 
in addition  as of december   the company employed people throughout the world 
although the company attempts to fulfill all of its obligations and enforce all of its rights under these agreements and relationships  and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company has been sued and may be sued  under numerous legal theories  including breach of contract  tort  products liability  intellectual property infringement and other theories 
such litigation  regardless of outcome  may have an adverse effect upon the company s profitability or public perception 
restructuring and other cost reduction activities during the third quarter of  the company restructured its operations in an attempt to align its cost structure with the company s future business direction and expected revenue streams 
the company can provide no assurance that these actions will lead to sustainable cost reductions or will otherwise benefit the company 
in addition  as a result of the restructuring and the compounded effects of multiple restructurings in recent years  the company is at risk that key personnel  experience or knowledge may be lost 
the company may incur legal liabilities and claims associated with the restructuring 
retention of key personnel the company s continued success will depend  in part  upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced personnel and to maintain continuity and stability within the company s senior management team 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
some skilled and experienced employees voluntarily resigned from the company during and there is a risk of additional resignations by such employees  particularly in light of recent restructuring activities  the company s recent financial performance  increased workloads resulting from the restructuring and recent improvements in the us economy 
the company regularly reviews and modifies its compensation programs as a tool to facilitate retention of key employees in an increasingly competitive job market 
as part of its overall employee retention program  the company has decided to more broadly grant stock options to key employees as compared to its practice in the past few years 
the company is expensing the fair value of such stock option grants and incurring related stock compensation expenses 
other risk factors significant portions of the company s sales are generated in europe and asia 
the company invoices the majority of its european customers in euros and invoices its remaining customers in us dollars 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that are not sufficiently hedged by international customers invoiced in us dollars could result in lower sales and have an adverse effect on future operating results see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below

american executives may overlook local trends outside the us  market ineffectively in countries outside of the us  
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors affecting future operating results continued institute efforts from an american perspective that are unsuccessful outside the us or be unaware of customs or laws in other countries  with resulting legal exposure  complaints  cost inefficiencies or weak sales 
the company s tax structure requires compliance with requirements in organizing  charter and enabling documents in addition to compliance with local laws and regulations 
any failure of the company to comply with such requirements  laws or regulations could result in significant fines  penalties or other material adverse consequences 
in summary  a number of factors could adversely affect the company or could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward looking statements 
such factors include the ability of management to manage an increasingly complex business in a highly competitive environment  transportation issues  product and component pricing  changes in analysts earnings estimates  competition  technological changes and advances  adoption of technology or communications standards affecting the company s products  intellectual property rights  litigation  general economic conditions  seasonality and changes or slowdowns in overall market demand for personal computer products and other consumer products which utilize the company s products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various interest rate risks including foreign currency  interest rate and securities price risks 
the company is exposed to various foreign currency exchange rate risks that arise in the normal course of business 
the company s functional currency is the us dollar 
the company has international operations resulting in receipts and payments in currencies that differ from the functional currency of the company 
the company attempts to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to company policies 
the company uses forward contracts to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when remeasured according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  impact the consolidated statement of operations 
all forward contracts entered into by the company are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
currently  the company is using only forward contract instruments to hedge its net balance sheet exposures 
the contracts are in european currencies and the singapore dollar 
the company enters into contracts throughout the month as necessary 
these contracts normally have maturities that do not exceed days 
when hedging balance sheet exposures  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income and expense in the same period that the gains and losses on remeasurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued the fair value of the company s forward contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market rates and prices 
if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken against these foreign currencies by  the hypothetical value of the contracts would have increased or decreased by approximately million at december  and million at december  however  these forward exchange contracts are hedges and consequently any market value gains or losses arising from these foreign exchange contracts should be offset by foreign exchange losses or gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
calculations of the above effects assume that each rate changed in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
the calculations reflect only those differences resulting from mechanically replacing one exchange rate with another 
they do not factor in any potential effects that changes in currency exchange rates may have on statement of operations translation  sales volume and prices and on local currency costs of production 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging programs include volatility of the currency and interest rate markets  availability of hedging instruments and the company s ability to accurately project net asset or liability positions 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the company s analysis depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements and the company s actual exposures and hedges 
the company did not have any significant debt outstanding at december  and december  should the company need to borrow funds in the future  it would be subject to credit based interest rate risks 
the company is also subject to interest rate risks on its current cash  cash equivalents and temporary investment balances 
for example  if the interest rate on the company s interest bearing investments were to change basis points  interest income would have hypothetically increased or decreased by million during and million during this hypothetical analysis does not take into consideration the effects of the economic conditions that would give rise to such an interest rate change or the company s response to such hypothetical conditions 
investments purchased with maturities in excess of three months are classified as temporary investments 
none of the company s temporary investments have an effective maturity greater than months and at december   the average duration of the company s temporary investments was less than months  as compared to less than months at december  at december   the company had debt security investments of million that will mature within one year and million that will mature in more than one year but less than two years 
the company seeks to minimize its credit risk associated with temporary investments by purchasing investment grade  liquid securities 
the company has classified all of its temporary investments as available for sale securities
