overview novavax is a fully integrated specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the research  development and commercialization of products utilizing our proprietary drug delivery and vaccine technologies for large and growing markets  concentrating on the areas of women s health and infectious diseases 
we currently market  sell and distribute a line of prescription pharmaceutical and prenatal vitamins through our national sales force  including our marketed product  estrasorb  the first topical emulsion for estrogen therapy 
we completed the validation of the manufacturing facility for estrasorb in and are in full commercial manufacturing 
in addition  we are conducting research and development on preventative vaccines and proteins  developing new products using our drug delivery technologies and expanding and consolidating our facilities 
our micellar nanoparticle technology involves the use of patented oil and water nanoemulsions that we believe can be used as vehicles for the topical delivery of a wide variety of drugs and other therapeutic products  including hormones 
we believe that our technologies represents the first time that hormones  such as estrogen and testosterone  have been encapsulated and delivered 
in october  we received our first commercial product approval utilizing our mnp technology 
estrasorb was approved by the fda for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause 
the commercial launch of estrasorb occurred in the second quarter of the approval by the fda of estrasorb and the subsequent launch of the product have been major milestones for novavax and have presented us with numerous current and future opportunities and challenges 
in addition  in the third quarter of we reacquired the worldwide rights to estrasorb from king pharmaceuticals  inc see developments in 
since its launch  estrasorb prescription trends have not met our initial expectations 
we attribute the slow start to the disruption of our marketing efforts as a result of the termination of the king relationship  the unanticipated simultaneous approval and launch of a competing product  the long lasting effects of the women s health initiative study  and an overall intensely competitive market 
despite the slow start  estrasorb is an important product and asset to us 
the product has been well accepted by physicians who are prescribing it and patients that are using it 
in order to grow the commercial sales of estrasorb worldwide  to internally develop products  identify partners for estrasorb or future products using our drug delivery vehicles  and to expand our total product lines  we are continuing to focus our efforts and financial resources on the further development of marketing plans and programs to effectively compete in the highly competitive estrogen therapy and women s health markets  the effective deployment  sizing and optimization of our sales force and resources  the manufacture of estrasorb at increasing commercial quantities and improved gross margins  the identification and selection of worldwide partners for sales of estrasorb  the acquisition or co promotion of new products  and the internal or partnered identification and development of future product candidates 
following the approval of estrasorb  we raised approximately million in november through the public offering of  shares of common stock  and in july we raised approximately million through the private placement of million of convertible notes and the issuance of million of common stock see developments in 
we may decide  or be required  to obtain additional financing  depending on the success of estrasorb and our marketing programs  the realization of our strategic objectives  and our success in identifying and developing product development candidates 
over the past two years we have added key senior management personnel in the areas of sales  marketing  human resources  vaccine development  manufacturing  clinical and drug delivery product development 
we will also continue to dedicate significant financial and human resources to create awareness about estrasorb and our unique drug delivery system 
in  we entered into an agreement with cardinal health  inc to lease a  square foot facility within its existing facility in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
we completed the validation of this facility and installation of the manufacturing equipment to accommodate commercial production of estrasorb early in  and began full commercial manufacturing of the product in the second quarter of the year 
this facility was designed to be able to produce commercial quantities that we believe could meet our marketing requirements for the next two to four years 
however  due to the fixed costs associated with building and maintaining a facility for full capacity  until our production requirements reach higher levels  our costs of goods sold will be higher than industry averages 
we believe we can significantly lower our costs of goods sold for estrasorb per unit and improve our margins as we increase production quantities and manufacturing efficiencies 
in addition  we are making progress towards introducing alternative packaging solutions for estrasorb and to streamline and lower costs of production 
while a significant portion of our efforts will be placed on expanding the commercial sales potential of estrasorb and the development of future pharmaceutical products utilizing our proprietary drug delivery platform delivery system  we will continue to support and market our existing line of women s health products and look for opportunities to expand our products through the acquisition or further development of our prenatal vitamin line 
we also conduct research and development on preventative vaccines and proteins for infectious diseases and cancers  and tolerogens to prevent the initiation and progression of stroke  heart attack and other inflammatory diseases 
currently  the major impetus is the development and exploitation of the company s core vlp technology  while continuing advances of more traditional vaccines 
vlps are genetically engineered particles that imitate the important three dimensional structures of viruses but are composed of recombinant proteins and therefore are believed incapable of causing infection and disease 
our proprietary production technology employs insect cells rather than eggs 
we can more rapidly produce a safe  effective low cost vaccine as compared with the labor intensive egg based process 
key advantages of the technology are the ability to rapidly respond to emerging threats or new strains and reduced risk allergic reaction 
projects in development using our proprietary vlp technology include vaccines for hiv  sars  and pandemic and seasonal influenza 
we are also developing e selectin tolerogen for the prevention of secondary strokes 
developments in in july  we announced that we had agreed with king pharmaceuticals  inc to terminate several license and co promotion agreements  for estrasorb  which enabled us to obtain all rights worldwide for the product  and androsorb  as well as all rights to other women s health products that we may successfully develop utilizing our drug delivery technology the king transaction 
as part of the king transaction  we also redeemed all of the million of convertible notes held by king 
in return for the redemption of the notes and the termination of the license and co promotion agreements  we paid king a net of million in cash and issued king  shares of our common stock  which shares were subsequently registered for resale 
the king transaction resulted in a gain on the redemption of debt of million 
this gain was determined based on the fair value of the convertible notes plus accrued interest as of the transaction date compared to the notes book value 
in addition  an intangible asset for estrasorb rights of million was recorded  which represents the difference between assets and liabilities acquired or written off  the net cash paid in the transaction  the common stock issued and transaction fees and expenses 
the intangible asset for estrasorb rights is being amortized over the patent life for estrasorb 
concurrent with the king transaction  in july the company also entered into definitive agreements for the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes to a group of institutional investors 
the notes carry a coupon  payable semi annually  mature in five years and are generally convertible into shares of common stock at per share 
from the third anniversary of the issue date of the notes  and subject to certain conditions  the company shall have the right to effect a mandatory conversion of the notes if the weighted average price of the common stock exceeds of the conversion price as of the issue date for each of trading days out of any consecutive trading days 
note holders shall have the right to require the company to redeem all or a portion of the notes if the weighted average price of the common stock for each of trading days out of consecutive trading days prior to either the third or fourth anniversary of the issue date of the notes is less than the then applicable conversion price of the company s common stock  provided that a holder s right to effect this optional redemption will not apply if certain revenue targets for estrasorb are achieved 
the notes are also redeemable upon the occurrence of specified events of default as well as a change of control as that term is defined in the notes of novavax 
in addition  in july the company issued  shares of common stock at per share  for gross proceeds of million  to an additional accredited investor 
aggregate gross proceeds of the notes and common stock issuances were million 
as a result of these transactions  we incurred million of transaction expenses  which increased the intangible asset for estrasorb rights by million included in the total intangible asset of estrasorb rights of million  decreased additional paid in capital by million  and increased deferred financing costs by million 
the deferred financing costs will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the convertible notes 
in july  we also entered into an agreement to lease a  square foot facility in malvern  pennsylvania  for the consolidation and expansion of corporate headquarters and to address the need for additional product development facilities 
we moved out of our facility in columbia  maryland and into this new facility in september the majority of the cost of this move and the required leasehold improvements were funded by agencies of the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
this facility move follows other facility consolidation efforts which began at the end of during  we plan to have consolidated from six to four facilities  with our manufacturing in philadelphia  pennsylvania  vaccine development in rockville  maryland  corporate headquarters and product development in malvern  pennsylvania  and a research lab in pacific grove  california 
in july  we announced that the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  a component of the national institutes of health  had cancelled its five year contract with the company for the development of human immunodeficiency virus vaccine candidates due to programmatic considerations for the government s convenience 
we had been the prime contractor  with emory university  tulane university  and the university of pittsburgh as subcontractors 
the cancellation is not expected to have a material financial impact and we expect to recover costs incurred to date in association with this contract 
we also have a second hiv vaccine program funded by the nih which was not impacted by this event 
critical accounting policies and changes to accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results could differ  and actual results that do differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
for further discussion of our accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herewith 
revenue recognition and allowances we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
for our product sales  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred to our distributor  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize these sales net of allowances for returns  rebates and chargebacks 
a large part of our product sales are to distributors who resell the products to their customers 
we provide rebates to members of certain buying groups who purchase from our distributors  to distributors that sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between us and the customer  and to state agencies that administer various programs such as the federal medicaid and medicare programs 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price for a product 
we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and record the liability as a reduction of revenue when we record our sale of the products 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to months after sale 
we regularly analyze the historical rebate trends and make adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
in a similar manner  we estimate amounts for returns based on historical trends  distributor and estimated wholesaler inventory levels and product prescription data and adjust those reserves as product returns occur 
a non recurring reserve of million for anticipated returns of vitamins negatively impacted by generic competition was netted against product sales for we based this reserve on estimated current wholesaler inventory levels compared to projected demand until product expiration 
the shipping and handling costs we incur are included in cost of sales in the accompanying statements of operations 
for up front payments and licensing fees related to our contract research or technology  we defer and recognize revenue as earned over the life of the related agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of contract specified events and when there are no remaining performance obligations 
for and  revenues earned under current research contracts were recognized per the terms and conditions of such contracts for invoicing of costs incurred and defined milestones 
in  revenue earned under research contracts was recognized on the percentage of completion method whereby revenue was recognized in proportion to the estimated percentage to complete the contract 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we will continue to incur research and development costs as we expand our product development activities in our women s health and vaccine programs 
our research and development costs have included  and will continue to include  expenses for internal development personnel  supplies and facilities  clinical trials  regulatory compliance and reviews  validation of processes and start up costs to establish commercial manufacturing capabilities 
at the time our new product candidates are approved by the fda and we begin commercial manufacturing  we will allocate costs at our manufacturing location to inventory cost of sales 
in  we began allocating our costs to manufacture estrasorb to inventory and cost of sales 
as a result  our research and development costs decreased and our inventory and cost of sales increased 
depreciation and amortization depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment is provided under the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  generally three to years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is provided over the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the term of the lease  whichever is shorter 
we have completed the build out and validation to meet fda requirements of our new manufacturing facility in philadelphia 
in addition  we purchased  validated and installed equipment for estrasrob manufacturing in the total investment in the facility and equipment is approximately million 
we began recognizing amortization or depreciation on these assets with the later of when manufacturing for commercialization began in or when the specific equipment was validated and placed in service 
the annualized amortization and depreciation expense is estimated to be million per year 
accounting for facility exit costs in july  the company entered into a long term agreement to lease a  square foot facility in malvern  pennsylvania for the consolidation and expansion of corporate headquarters and product development activities 
the lease  with a commencement date of september   has an initial term of years with two five year renewal options 
standard annual escalation rental rates are in effect during the initial lease term 
with advance notice  the company also has an option to lease adjoining space of  square feet  which could be built out for future manufacturing needs 
the company applied the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  in accounting for contract termination costs and associated costs that will continue to be incurred under the operating lease expiring on october  relating to it s former corporate offices located in columbia  maryland 
the company recorded a liability of  as of september  for the difference between the fair value of the remaining lease payments  reduced by current estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained and included the corresponding expense in facility exit costs 
as of december  the remaining liabilities were  the company applied the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and apb no 
 accounting changes  in writing off the remaining useful lives of the leasehold assets relating to the columbia facility 
for the year ended december    was included in facility exit costs associated with the moving of corporate offices 
goodwill and intangibles assets goodwill principally resulted from business acquisitions  such as the million of goodwill we recognized for our acquisition of fielding pharmaceuticals in december assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill are the result of product acquisitions  non compete arrangements  and internally discovered patents 
other assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from five to years 
the company periodically evaluates the periods of amortization to determine whether later events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
other intangible assets continued to be amortized over their useful lives beginning in the first quarter of the company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis  which includes profitability information  estimated future operating results  trends and other information in assessing whether the value of indefinite lived intangible assets can be recovered 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the company tested its goodwill for impairment as of january  and determined that no impairment was present 
in the fourth quarters of   and  the company performed the required annual impairment test on the carrying amount of its goodwill  which indicated the company s estimated fair value of goodwill exceeded it carrying value  therefore  no impairment was identified at december   or if the appraisal had determined that the goodwill was impaired  the write down would have increased our net loss by a comparable amount 
stock options we apply the principles of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for stock options issued to our employees 
apb no 
generally does not require that options granted to employees be expensed 
had we applied the fair value principles of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  our net loss for the years ended december   and would have increased to approximately million  million and million  respectively  as compared to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the financial accounting standards board eliminated the alternative use of apb no 
s intrinsic value method of accounting starting with the first interim reporting period that begins after june  we will be required to record the effect of applying this revision at such time 
during  the company granted stock options to purchase an aggregate  shares of common stock to two consultants as compensation for services in we included  of non cash stock compensation expense in sales and marketing expense  which represents the fair value as of the grant date 
guarantee in april  we executed a conditional guaranty of a brokerage margin account for a director  in the amount of  prior to demanding payment from the company  the brokerage firm must first make demand for payment to the director and then liquidate the account 
thereafter  if there remains a shortfall  they may demand payment from the company 
as of december  and  the company has not recorded any liability on its balance sheet related to this guarantee as we believe the possibility of required payment by the company to be unlikely 
results of operations for fiscal years  and in thousands  except percentage changes and share and per share information revenues change from change from revenues vitamins gynodiol avc line estrasorb other net product sales contract research milestone and licensing fees includes a reserve in for anticipated returns of million 
revenues for consisted of product sales of million  compared to million in  contract revenues of million  compared to million in  and milestone and licensing fees of million in  compared to million in total revenues for were million  as compared to million for  a million or decrease 
of the total decrease in revenues  product sales accounted for million 
the reason for this net decrease is primarily due to an overall reduction in sales of prenatal vitamins  gynodiol and avc cream  as well as increased returns for these products from our wholesalers 
we feel the lower sales orders and the high volume of returns from our customers are primarily due to wholesaler orders in late and that projected product growth and could not anticipate the future effects of generic and new product competition on their inventory requirements 
a non recurring reserve of million taken in for anticipated returns of vitamins negatively impacted by generic competition 
we based this reserve on current estimated wholesaler inventory levels compared to projected demand until product expiration 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in sales of estrasorb during the commercial launch of estrasorb occurred during the quarter ended june  and initial shipments to wholesalers were million in june contract revenues increased by million or primarily due to million we received from an nih grant to develop a second generation aids vaccine  as well as  million we received from an nih contract that was cancelled in july see developments in 
this increase in contract revenues was offset by the completion of several contracts in revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were million compared to million in this represents a year to year decrease of million  or 
of the million total revenue decrease from to  a decline in product sales accounted for million of that shortage 
the product sales decrease was attributable to an overall decline in our prenatal vitamin lines due to generic competition  offset by slightly higher sales from the gynodiol product line and the fourth quarter introduction of our new prenatal vitamins  novanatal and novastart 
milestone revenue decreased approximately million  primarily due to a one time recognition of million on a milestone payment in contract research revenue increased million from million in to million in operating costs and expenses change from change from operating costs and expenses cost of products sold research and development selling marketing general and administrative facility exit costs gain on redemption of debt cost of sales cost of sales increased to million in  compared to million in  despite the decrease in product sales of million 
the million increase was primarily due to the launch and sale of estrasorb in the second quarter of estrasorb accounted for of net product sales and carries a much higher cost of sales than our other products 
in the initial periods of estrasorb production  the cost of sales percentages have been and will be unusually high until we increase production volumes to offset the fixed costs and depreciation related to the build out of the manufacturing facility  on going facility costs and costs associated with the minimum number of personnel required to manufacture the product 
we are also making progress on the introduction of alternative packaging solutions to further streamline and lower costs of production 
a high volume of returns for our products  other than estrasorb  in has also negatively affected our margins 
cost of sales was million in  compared to million in the year to year decrease was primarily due to decreases in product sales for the same periods 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales decreased to in from in  due to product mix and sampling protocols which changed per the product mix year to year 
research and development expenses research and development costs decreased from million in to million in the decrease of million or was due to manufacturing start up costs in being accounted for in the research and development category until april the manufacturing costs were incurred to prepare and validate the estrasorb facility for good manufacturing practices and fda compliance and not to build inventory 
beginning in april  manufacturing costs have been included in cost of sales and inventory 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million for the decrease of million  or  was primarily attributable to decreased spending in our vaccines programs  offset slightly by increased spending on manufacturing start up costs related to preparing our manufacturing facility for commercial production of estrasorb 
the manufacturing start up costs relate primarily to facility lease expenses  validation services  product stability testing and personnel costs 
reconciliation of significant research and development projects the following table reconciles the direct and indirect costs incurred to date for our major projects to our total research and development expense 
project estrasorb androsorb vaccine contracts and research allocated project costs other unallocated costs total estimated cost and time to complete major projects the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   our proprietary product candidates were in early stages of development 
due to the inherent nature of product development  future market demand for products and factors outside of our control  such as clinical results and regulatory approvals  we are unable to estimate the completion dates and the estimated total costs for those product candidates 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical trial protocol  including  but not limited to  the following number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  duration of the patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  number of clinical sites included in the trials  and length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
in addition  we test our potential products in numerous preclinical studies to identify  among other things  the daily dosage amounts 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results for our trials we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or indications 
we further believe that it is not possible to predict the length of regulatory approval time 
factors that are outside our control could significantly delay the approval and marketability of our product candidates 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above and other risks and uncertainties  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to numerous variations 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue pursuing our business strategy 
for more discussion of the risks and uncertainties and our liquidity  see risks and uncertainties and liquidity and capital resources 
selling expenses selling expenses were million in compared to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to the addition of sales personnel resulting from the termination of our co promotion agreements with king in july and the hiring of king sales personnel 
selling expenses were million in compared to million in with the initial anticipation of the fda s approval of estrasorb in  the company began incurring selling costs associated with the product launch 
later  the company withdrew its application  which resulted in the decrease in selling costs for marketing expenses marketing expenses were million in compared to million in the increase of million  or  was due to the product launch advertising and promotion for estrasorb  as well as increases in marketing personnel 
marketing expenses were million in compared to million in with the initial anticipation of the fda s approval of estrasorb in  the company began incurring marketing costs to actively develop marketing materials and programs for the product launch 
when the company withdrew its application  all further marketing costs were stopped 
general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in compared to million in the million increase  or  is primarily due to increases in accounting and consulting fees related to the implementation of internal control evaluation and reporting procedures as required by the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as other increases in legal  insurance and facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in and million in the reduction of million in over was due to major reductions in administrative and executive personnel and other expenses in the second half of  resulting from the delay in the approval of estrasorb 
these reductions continued through the third quarter of  at which time we began rehiring in anticipation of the approval of estrasorb 
other a one time charge for facility exit costs of million was recorded in as previously described  in september we moved to malvern  pennsylvania for the consolidation and expansion of corporate headquarters and product development activities 
we vacated our facility in columbia  maryland and recorded a liability of million for contract termination costs and wrote off the net value of the columbia leasehold assets of million

net interest expenses remained relatively unchanged from to net losses change from change from net loss net loss per share weighted shares outstanding net loss for was million or per share  as compared to million or per share for  an increase of million  or per share 
the increased loss was due to the gain on redemption of debt of million  offset by a decrease in revenues of million  million for facility exit costs and an increase in other operating expenses of million  all previously discussed 
net loss for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for the decreased loss of million from to related primarily to the million reduction of sales and marketing expenses that was incurred in principally for the anticipated product launch of estrasorb  million reductions in general and administrative expenses for similar reasons  million reductions in research and development  as described above  offset by revenue reductions of million  as previously discussed 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to product sales and returns  the ability to gain market share for estrasorb  the marketing and manufacturing costs of estrasorb  the commitments and progress of our research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and changes in our development of commercialization activities and arrangements 
we plan to have multiple products in various stages of product development and we believe our research and development as well as selling  marketing and general administrative expenses and capital requirements will continue to increase 
future activities  including the potential expansion of sales and marketing personnel and programs  increases in commercial scale manufacturing capabilities and product development are subject to our ability to raise funds through debt or equity financing  or collaborative arrangements with industry partners

operating activities consisted of the net loss of million  as previously discussed  and non cash activities of million  including the million gain on the redemption of debt  offset by million of net changes in balance sheet accounts 
cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures associated with the validation of our manufacturing facility for estrasorb and million of costs for the new corporate office leasehold improvements see developments in 
in the future  we expect similar or even greater cash needs as we anticipate additional hires for production  sales and marketing  as well as increased marketing costs for estrasorb  particularly in light of the termination of our co promotion agreements with king 
additionally  as we approach full production capacity  increased inventory needs will reduce our operating funds 
working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital of million  or was primarily due to the million used for operating activities  offset by the new cash of million from the king and financing transactions in july of as noted in the overview  we received fda approval for estrasorb in october and the commercial launch of estrasorb occurred in the second quarter of during  we incurred substantial selling  marketing and manufacturing expenses associated with the initial year of commercial production  including recruiting and retaining personnel and developing marketing programs necessary for the sale of estrasorb 
in addition  our first year sales of estrasorb were below our initial expectations 
we did not receive any receipts from product sales of estrasorb until a few months after the initial shipments  and our projected sales for estrasorb and subsequent cash receipts likely will not offset the expenses and cost of manufacturing 
in addition to the costs related to estrasorb  we may incur increasing costs in to build our organization and to develop our other product candidates that will utilize our drug delivery technologies 
the company will continue to pursue obtaining capital through co promotion arrangements  product licensing or the public or private sale of securities of the company 
the company has demonstrated our ability to obtain capital  as required  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital or  if such capital is available  that the terms of any financing will be satisfactory to the company 
based on our assessment of the availability of capital and our business operations as currently contemplated  in the absence of new financings  licensing arrangements or partnership agreements  we believe we will have adequate resources for the third quarter of if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we will continue to assess our capital resources and based on those resources we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our product research and development programs  downsize our organization  reduce or defer our marketing expenses  or reduce general and administrative infrastructure

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its investments in cash equivalents 
the company s investment policy requires investments in short term  low risk instruments 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
if interest rates fall  floating rate securities will generate less interest income 
the company does not believe that is exposed to any material interest rate risk as a result of its investments in cash equivalents 
at december   the company had a total debt of million  most of which bears interest at fixed interest rates 
the company therefore does not believe that it is exposed to any material interest rate risk as a result of its borrowing activities
