portfolio loans the company s loan portfolio is comprised of domestic loans to businesses and consumers 
at december  and  there were no loans to foreign debtors outstanding and the amount of agribusiness loans outstanding was insignificant 
loans to businesses are classified as commercial loans and are further segregated as commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans 
commercial and industrial loans are made to local small and medium sized corporations primarily to finance working capital and equipment purchases 
commercial real estate loans represent loans secured by real estate and consist of real estate construction loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans 
real estate construction loans are made to builders or developers of real estate properties and are typically refinanced at completion  becoming either income producing or owner occupied properties 
commercial real estate mortgage loans are secured by owner occupied or income producing properties 
for owner occupied property loans  the primary source of repayment is the cash flow of the owner with the real estate serving as a secondary repayment source 
income producing property loans are made to entities or individuals engaged in real estate investment  and the primary source of repayment is derived from the rental or sale of the property 
loans to consumers include residential real estate mortgage loans and installment loans

credit risk is the risk that the principal balance of a loan and any related interest will not be collected due to the inability of the borrower to repay the loan 
the company manages credit risk in its loan portfolio by adhering to consistent underwriting standards  lending limits  guidelines and other limitations established by senior management 
various approval levels  based on the amount of the loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured  have also been established 
loan approval authority ranges from the individual loan officer to the directors loan committee 
republic bank has established loan review and quality control functions to conduct ongoing  independent reviews of the lending process and thereby facilitate compliance with established policies and procedures  compliance with applicable laws and regulations  objective measurement of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  and proper documentation of loans 
the following discussion summarizes the underwriting policies and procedures for the major categories within the loan portfolio and addresses the company s strategies for managing the related credit risk 
commercial loans credit risk associated with commercial loans is primarily influenced by prevailing economic conditions and the level of underwriting risk the company is willing to assume 
to manage credit risk when extending commercial credit  the company focuses on adequately assessing the borrower s ability to repay and by obtaining sufficient collateral 
to minimize credit risk  the company concentrates its commercial lending efforts on commercial real estate loans 
at december   commercial real estate loans accounted for of total commercial loans 
emphasis is also placed on loans that are government guaranteed  such as sba loans 
commercial loans are generally secured by the borrower s assets at a or less loan to value ratio and by personal guarantees 
management closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to avoid significant credit concentrations by borrower or industry 
residential real estate mortgage loans the company originates fixed rate and variable rate residential mortgage loans which are secured by the underlying unit family residential property 
at december   these loans accounted for of total portfolio loans 
credit risk in this area of lending is minimized by the assessment of the creditworthiness of the borrower  including debt to income ratios  credit bureau scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan to value ratios of generally no more than 
residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan to value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance  unless otherwise guaranteed or insured by the federal or state government 
credit risk is further reduced since the majority of the company s fixed rate mortgage loan production is sold to investors in the secondary market without recourse 
installment loans credit risk in the installment loan portfolio is managed through consistent adherence to conservative underwriting standards that consider  but are not necessarily limited to  debt to income levels  past payment tendencies as evidenced by credit bureau reports  and loan to collateral value ratios 
asset quality non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  restructured loans and other real estate owned oreo 
oreo represents real estate properties acquired by the company through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure 
commercial loans are generally placed on non accrual status at the time the loan is or more days past due  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
residential real estate mortgage loans and installment loans are placed in non accrual status at the time the loan is four scheduled payments past due or days or more past the maturity date of the loan 
in all cases  loans may be placed on non accrual status earlier when  in the opinion of management  reasonable doubt exists as to the full  timely collection of interest or principal 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non accrual status is reversed and charged against current income 
any interest payments subsequently received on non accrual loans are applied against the principal balance 
loans are considered restructured when the company makes certain concessions to a financially troubled debtor that would not normally be considered

as of december   total potential problem loans  excluding those categorized as non accrual loans  were million  or of total portfolio loans  compared to million  or of total portfolio loans at december  the following table presents the amount of interest income that would have been earned on non performing loans outstanding at december   and had those loans been accruing interest in accordance with the original terms of the loan agreement  as well as the amount of interest income earned and included in net interest income for each of those years 
table forgone interest on non performing loans for the year ended december in thousands non accrual restructured non accrual restructured non accrual restructured pro forma interest income interest income recognized forgone interest income impaired loans sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas  considers a loan impaired when it is probable that payment of principal and interest will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
at december   all potential problem loans  classified as watch and substandard with the exception of installment loans  and all non accrual and restructured loans with the exception of installment loans were reviewed for impairment 
prior to the fourth quarter of  only non accrual and restructured commercial loans were reviewed for impairment 
an impaired loan for which it is deemed necessary to record a specific allocated allowance may be written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral via a direct charge off against the allowance for loan losses at the time it is determined the loan balance exceeds the fair value of the collateral 
an impaired loan not requiring a specific allocated allowance represents a loan for which the fair value of the underlying collateral equals or exceeds the recorded investment in the loan 
all impaired loans were evaluated using the fair value of the underlying collateral as the measurement method 
at december  and  the gross recorded investment in impaired loans totaled million and million  respectively 
interest payments subsequently received on non accrual loans are applied against the principal balance 
interest income continues to be recognized on all other loans reviewed for impairment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impaired loans 
provision and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate of probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level the company believes is adequate through the provision for loan losses 
due to the inherent risks and uncertainties related to the operation of a financial institution  management must depend on estimates  appraisals and valuations of loans to prepare the company s financial statements 
changes in economic conditions and the financial prospects of borrowers may result in abrupt changes to the estimates  appraisals or evaluations used 
in addition  if actual circumstances and losses differ substantially from management s assumptions and estimates  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to absorb all future losses  and net income could be adversely impacted 
net loan charge offs decreased million to million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in is primarily due to decreases in the company s commercial and installment loan charge offs  as well as an increase in commercial loan recoveries of million

generally  if management determines a loan to be under collateralized  then a charge off will be recommended no later than the month in which the loan becomes days past due 
open end installment loans home equity lines of credit are generally charged off when they become days past due

net income and prior period balances were not affected by this reclassification 
the separate allowance is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
at december   the allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allocated component  a risk allocated component and an unallocated component 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimation completed pursuant to either sfas  accounting for contingencies  or sfas the specific and risk allocated components of the allowance for loan losses reflect expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocation for individual loans deemed impaired under sfas and historical loss experience for each loan category in the aggregate  but excluding loans individually reviewed for impairment 
the specific allowance allocations are based on regular analyses of all commercial and residential real estate loans where the internal graded loan category is at or below a predetermined classification watch  substandard  doubtful and loss 
the projected loss ratios utilized in the risk allocated component incorporate factors such as historical charge off experience and current economic trends and conditions 
actual loss ratios experienced in the future may vary from the projected loss ratios utilized in the risk allocated component 
the uncertainty occurs because factors affecting the determination of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio may exist which are not necessarily captured by the application of projected loss ratios or economic trends and other conditions 
accordingly  the unallocated portion of the allowance is maintained to capture these probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the unallocated allowance reflects management s view that the allowance should recognize the margin for error inherent in the process of estimating expected loan losses in the loan portfolio 
factors that were considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the company s unallocated allowance include the imprecision in the projected loss ratios and the risk associated with new customer relationships  which may not be consistent with the risks associated with established customers 
additional factors in the evaluation include economic conditions and industry trends 
the unallocated allowance was million at december   a decrease of million from the allowance for loan losses on unfunded loan commitments is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses  modified to take into account the probability of funding the commitments 
the following table summarizes the company s allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific allocated  risk allocated and unallocated allowances by loan type and the percentage of each loan type of total portfolio loans

grades for commercial loans are assigned based upon review of such factors such as debt service coverage  collateral value  financial condition of the borrower  experience and reputation of management and payment history 
delinquent mortgage and installment loans are reviewed monthly and assigned a rating based on their payment status 
in addition  the commercial loan review committee will  on a monthly basis  conduct reviews of certain commercial loans exceeding  that have not exhibited delinquency trends 
these reviews assign a current risk rating based on management s understanding of the financial condition of the borrower and collateral values 
all non accrual loans are included in the substandard or doubtful classifications in the company s risk rating methodology 
based upon these reviews  the company determines the grades for its loan portfolio on a monthly basis 
these reviews provide a mechanism that results in loans being graded in the proper category and accordingly  determines whether the loans are reviewed for the specific allocated allowance or are assigned projected loss ratios

the risk percentages were developed by the company in consultation with regulatory authorities  actual loss experience  peer group loss experience and were adjusted for current economic conditions 
such risk percentages were applied to individual loans based on loan type 
for december  and  only non accrual commercial loans were considered impaired 
the change in the estimation method of the allowance for loan losses incorporated in the fourth quarter of  did not result in a change in the overall allowance balances compared to prior periods  except for the reclassification for the allowance on unfunded loan commitments 
the change in the estimation method resulted in the establishment of the specific allocated allowance and a decrease in the unallocated allowance

table contractual obligations december  note due within one to three to over in thousands reference one year three years five years five years total deposits without a stated maturity certificates of deposits short term borrowings short term fhlb advances long term fhlb advances and security repurchase agreements long term debt operating leases see deposits on page for further discussion on deposit balances 
the company has also entered into interest rate swap transactions with a total notional amount of million as part of its asset liability management activities and associated management of interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
interest rate swaps are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the contracts change daily as market interest rates change 
interest rate swaps involve monthly or quarterly cash settlement 
because the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at december  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet transactions in the normal course of business  the company becomes a party to transactions involving financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers and to manage its own exposure to interest rate risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the contractual amounts of these instruments express the extent of the company s involvement in these transactions as of the balance sheet date 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk  market risk and liquidity risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
however  management believes that they do not represent unusual risks for the company 
commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend cash to a customer as long as there is no breach of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee 
standby letters of credit guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the company issues these guarantees primarily to support public and private borrowing arrangements  real estate construction projects  bond financing and similar transactions 
the credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with direct lending 
therefore  these instruments are subject to the company s loan review and approval procedures and credit policies 
based upon management s credit evaluation of the counterparty  the company may require the counterparty to provide collateral as security for the agreement  including real estate  accounts receivable  inventories and investment securities 
the maximum credit risk associated with these instruments equals their contractual amounts and assumes that the counterparty defaults and the collateral proves to be worthless 
the total contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  since many of these agreements may expire without being drawn upon 
during  the company reclassified million of its allowance for loan losses to a separate allowance for probable credit losses inherent in unfunded loan commitments 
the separate allowance is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
at december   deferred revenue for standby letters of credit was  at december   deferred revenue for standby letters of credit was  the following table presents the contractual amounts and expected maturities of the company s off balance sheet financial instruments outstanding at december  table off balance sheet contractual obligations december due within one to three to over in thousands one year three years five years five years total financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to fund residential real estate loans commitments to fund commercial real estate loans other unused commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to provide funds at an acceptable cost to meet loan demand and deposit withdrawals and to service other liabilities as they become due 
managing liquidity also enables the company to take advantage of opportunities for business expansion 
funds are available from a number of sources  including  but not limited to  cash and money market investments  the investment securities portfolio  mortgage loans held for sale and portfolio loan repayments and maturities 
short term liquidity is available from federal funds purchased  security repurchase agreements  deposit growth  retail  brokered and municipal certificates of deposit and fhlb advances 
long term liquidity is generated from security repurchase agreements  deposit growth  the maturity structure of time deposits  brokered certificates of deposit and fhlb advances 
as of december   the company s balance of certificates of deposit maturing within the next twelve months was million 
the company expects that a significant portion of these certificates of deposit will be renewed based on the company s success at establishing long lasting customer relationships 
however  the company will use its other available funding sources to replace those deposits which are not renewed 
at december   republic bank had available million in unused lines of credit with third parties for federal funds purchased and million available in unused borrowings with the fhlb 
republic bancorp inc has four major funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements interest earning deposits  dividends from republic bank  access to the capital markets and a revolving credit agreement with a third party 
on december   million was available from republic bank for payment of dividends to the parent company without prior regulatory approval  compared to million at december  also  at december   the parent company had interest earning deposits of million at republic bank to meet any liquidity requirements 
in december  the company entered into a million revolving credit agreement with a third party with a floating interest rate based on libor 
there were no advances outstanding under the agreement at december   which expires on december  depending on market conditions and liquidity requirements  the company would also consider the issuance of additional debt or equity instruments to provide additional liquidity  if necessary 
as discussed in item of this report on form k  republic bank is subject to statutory and regulatory requirements and  among other things  may be limited in their ability to pay dividends to the parent company 
these statutory and regulatory restrictions have not had  and are not expected to have  a material effect on the company s ability to meet its cash obligations 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is composed entirely of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid withdrawn  reprice or mature in specified periods 
because the company s business is subject to many factors beyond its control see forward looking statements on page in managing the company s assets and liabilities  and overall exposure to risk  management must rely on numerous estimates  evaluations and assumptions 
consequently  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by management or expressed in the company s press releases and public documents 
asset and liability management the primary objective of asset and liability management is to maintain stability in the level of net interest income by producing the optimal yield and maturity mix of assets and liabilities within the interest rate risk limits set by the company s asset and liability management committee alco and consistent with projected liquidity needs and capital adequacy requirements 
interest rate risk management the company s alco  which meets weekly  is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
senior management at republic bank is responsible for ensuring that the bank s asset and liability management procedures adhere to corporate policies and risk limits established by its board of directors 
during  short term interest rates increased while long term interest rates remained fairly flat 
the three month treasury bill increased basis points and the prime lending rate increased basis points at december  from december   while the year treasury bond decreased basis points during the demand for residential loans was significantly lower in compared to as an increase in long term interest rates in the latter half of slowed residential loan demand in the fourth quarter of and throughout all of during  residential mortgage loan originations decreased from as refinance volume slowed significantly 
the company s residential real estate mortgage balance increased during the year  as new mortgage loan production more than offset loan payoffs within the portfolio 
commercial loan balances grew due to the successful efforts by our team of experienced commercial lenders and lending rates that remained attractive to commercial borrowers 
interest rates and successful sales efforts also continued to attract home equity borrowers as the balance of consumer direct loans grew in the mortgage loans held for sale balance is the company s most interest rate sensitive asset 
it is also short term in nature as the majority of loans held for sale are sold within days 
by funding this balance with primarily short term borrowings  the company is able to closely match its liquidity needs  as this balance will generally increase in a declining interest rate environment and decrease in a rising interest rate environment 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  committing to fund residential real estate loan applications at specified rates and holding residential mortgage loans for sale exposes the company to market risk during the period from when a customer locks in a specific rate to when the loan is sold to the investor 
to reduce this exposure to market risk  the company enters into firm commitments to sell such mortgage loans at specified future dates and prices to various third parties 
the company utilizes two complementary quantitative tools to measure and monitor interest rate risk static gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling 
each of these interest rate risk measurements has limitations  but the company believes that when evaluated together  they provide a reasonably comprehensive view of the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
static gap analysis static gap analysis is utilized at the end of each month to measure the amount of interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet as of a point in time 
the company undertakes this analysis by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period 
this gap provides a general indication of the sensitivity of the company s net interest income to interest rate changes 
if more assets than liabilities reprice or mature in a given period  resulting in an asset sensitive position or positive gap  increases in market interest rates will generally benefit net interest income because earning asset rates will reflect the changes more quickly than rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
alternatively  if interest bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than interest earning assets  resulting in a liability sensitive position or negative gap  then increases in market interest rates will generally have an adverse impact on net interest income 
table presents the static gap analysis at the dates indicated 
at december   the cumulative one year gap was a positive of total earning assets 
at december   the cumulative one year gap was a positive of total earning assets 
the company s current policy is to maintain a mix of assets and liabilities with repricing and maturity characteristics that reflect a moderate amount of short term interest rate risk based on management s evaluation of current interest rate projections  customer credit demands and deposit preferences 
the company generally operates in a range of zero to positive of total earning assets for the cumulative one year gap 
management believes that this range reduces the vulnerability of net interest income to large shifts in market interest rates while allowing the company to take advantage of fluctuations in current short term rates 
this range also complements the company s strong retail mortgage banking franchise 
earnings simulation on a monthly basis  the earnings simulation model is used to quantify the effects of various hypothetical changes in interest rates on the company s projected net interest income over the ensuing twelve month period 
the model permits management to evaluate the effects of various parallel shifts of the us treasury yield curve  upward and downward  on expected net interest income in a stable interest rate environment ie  base net interest income 
as of december   the earnings simulation model projects the following change in net interest income from base net interest income  assuming an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates change in market interest rates in basis points change in net interest income over the next twelve months these projected levels  which are well within the company s policy limits  portray the company s interest rate risk position as asset sensitive for the one year horizon 
the earnings simulation model assumes that current balance sheet totals remain constant and all maturities and prepayments of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are reinvested at current market rates 
impact of interest rate fluctuations and inflation on earnings unlike most industrial companies  substantially all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rate fluctuations generally have a more significant and direct impact on a financial institution s performance than do the effects of inflation 
to the extent inflation affects interest rates  real estate values and other costs  the company s lending activities may be adversely impacted 
if significant increases in interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential property and to qualify for mortgage loans  then the company s volume of loans originated may be reduced and the potential reduction in the related interest income and fee income may be larger than would be implied by a simple linear extrapolation of the results generated by the earnings simulation model 
a lower interest rate environment that enables more potential borrowers to reduce their mortgage interest rate and qualify for relatively higher mortgage loan balances  would be expected to result in higher mortgage loan production activity as well as interest income

accounting and financial reporting developments the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies require estimates and assumptions which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the most critical of these significant accounting policies is the policy for the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate of probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level the company believes is adequate through the provision for loan losses 
due to the inherent risks and uncertainties related to the operation of a financial institution  management must depend on estimates  appraisals and valuations of loans to prepare the company s financial statements 
changes in economic conditions and the financial prospects of borrowers may result in abrupt changes to the estimates  appraisals or evaluations used 
in addition  if actual circumstances and losses differ substantially from management s assumptions and estimates  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to absorb all future losses  and net income could be adversely impacted 
at december   the allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allocated component  a risk allocated component and an unallocated component 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimation completed pursuant to either sfas  accounting for contingencies  or sfas the specific and risk allocated components of the allowance for loan losses reflect expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocation for individual loans deemed impaired under sfas and historical loss experience for each loan category in the aggregate  but excluding loans individually reviewed for impairment 
the specific allowance allocations are based on regular analyses of all commercial and residential real estate loans where the internal graded loan category is at or below a predetermined classification watch  substandard  doubtful and loss 
the projected loss ratios utilized in the risk allocated component incorporate factors such as historical charge off experience and current economic trends and conditions 
actual loss ratios experienced in the future may vary from the projected loss ratios utilized in the risk allocated component 
the uncertainty occurs because factors affecting the determination of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio may exist which are not necessarily captured by the application of projected loss ratios or economic trends and other conditions 
accordingly  the unallocated portion of the allowance is maintained to capture these probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the unallocated allowance reflects management s view that the allowance should recognize the margin for error inherent in the process of estimating expected loan losses in the loan portfolio 
factors that were considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the company s unallocated allowance include the imprecision in the projected loss ratios and the risk associated with new customer relationships  which may not be consistent with the risks associated with established customers 
additional factors in the evaluation include economic conditions and industry trends
