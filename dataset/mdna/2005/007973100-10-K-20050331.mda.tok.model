executive summary we focused substantial attention in on reducing costs  by making significant progress in our transition of high volume manufacturing from our fort collins  colorado facility to our shenzhen  china facility  methodically addressing our inventory and materials costs  and bringing greater discipline to our product life cycle program 
by the end of  we had transitioned to our shenzhen facility production of of the product lines we currently plan to transition 
we expect to transfer the remaining product lines by the end of also by the end of  we had selected tier asian suppliers for a substantial portion of the parts and components anticipated to be used in the production of these product lines 
during the transition of the product lines to our shenzhen facility  we have been incurring significant 
table of contents operating and logistics costs as a result of duplicate manufacturing facilities in shenzhen and fort collins  which has placed significant downward pressure on our gross margin 
as the transition of production progresses  in addition to our realizing significantly lower labor and other costs at the shenzhen facility compared to our fort collins facility  the need for the inefficient duplicate manufacturing and related costs should decline 
our net loss for was million  compared to a net loss of million in and million in the improvement was principally due to the higher sales base 
our sales in were million  a increase over sales in  and our sales in reflected an increase of over sales in our increasing sales from to principally reflect recovery from the downturns in the semiconductor  semiconductor capital equipment  and flat panel display industries 
our sales in the second half of  however  were lower than our sales in the first half of  due to decreasing sales to our semiconductor oem customers  offset by continued growth in the flat panel display and other advanced thin film markets such as industrial coatings 
we believe the decline in our sales to our semiconductor oem customers reflects an industry slowdown 
our gross margin remained low in we expect gross margin to improve as the transition of high volume manufacturing to our shenzhen facility and move to tier asian suppliers progress 
we also expect the operational changes we have effected  particularly in our pricing  procurement and product life cycle management programs  to positively impact our gross margin beginning in results of operations the following table summarizes certain data as a percentage of sales extracted from our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative litigation damages restructuring charges impairment of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations other expense net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss

years ended december  in thousands united states and canada europe asia rest of world years ended december  united states and canada europe asia rest of world total sales were million in  million in and million in  representing an increase of from to and from to this growth is due primarily to recovery from downturns in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries  and continued growth of the flat panel display industry 
in  the industry upturns were most notable in the first half of the year 
sales in the second half of decreased from the first half  as the semiconductor capital equipment industry appears to be entering a slowdown 
looking forward  we expect that this slowdown will continue in the near term 
our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry declined by approximately from to and increased by approximately from to  due primarily to the cyclicality of this industry 
our sales to the data storage  flat panel display and advanced product applications markets  have been steadily increasing each year from through this growth is primarily attributed to market share gains  order trends and the general expansion of end customer products including large flat panel displays  liquid crystal displays  dvd applications and applications 
table of contents dependent upon industrial coatings 
flat panel display sales have grown most notably  with an increase of from to and from to the increase from to was primarily driven by sales of our new summit dc power system to oem customers building pvd tools for generation and generation panel sizes 
certain of our major customers require shipping terms of fob destination point 
when the majority of our shipments were made from fort collins the one day shipping time in the united states resulted in minimal delay of revenue recognition from time of shipment 
given the volume of shipments coming from china to the united states  beginning in  we will be delaying the recognition of revenue for these shipments by five to seven days on sales to these certain major customers 
the impact of the acquisitions of aera japan  ltd 
aera and dressler hf technik gmbh dressler on the sales level was minimal and would not impact the sales growth percentage from to  as a vast majority of the sales of these entities were included in the consolidated operating results 
gross margin our gross margin was in  in and in our gross margins during these years have been adversely affected principally by the following factors the lower sales base caused in large part by the severe downturn in the semiconductor equipment industry during and most of  resulted in lower absorption of our fixed costs  lower average selling prices than anticipated  during our transition of high volume manufacturing to shenzhen  china beginning in  we have been required to operate manufacturing facilities in both shenzhen and fort collins to produce the same products  which has required duplicate management  procurement and engineering teams  as well as facilities costs  and the transition has taken longer than initially anticipated  increased shipping and related costs in and for products manufactured in our shenzhen facility  high demand for two product groups with margins lower than our corporate average  charges for excess and obsolete inventory were approximately million in  million in and million in  and warranty costs  particularly with respect to the introduction of new products  were approximately million in  million in  and million in the improvement in gross margin from to was primarily due to cost reduction measures and improved absorption of overhead due to the higher sales base 
the decline in gross margin from to was primarily due to lower average selling prices than anticipated  increasing manufacturing costs at the shenzhen facility as production of more product lines were transferred and customers began accepting products from such facility  without equivalent decreases in manufacturing and facilities costs at our fort collins facility impact of approximately basis points  high demand during for product lines with relatively low margins  and excess and obsolete inventory charges during the fourth quarter of resulting from changes in our product life cycle management program  
table of contents discontinuance of certain products in select markets  the product mix shift from mm wafers to mm wafers and the expected continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry in the near term 
we have taken measures to bring greater discipline to our pricing  procurement and product life cycle management programs 
we expect gross margin to improve as the transition of high volume manufacturing to our shenzhen facility and move to tier asian suppliers progress  resulting in lower labor and materials costs 
however  factors that could cause our gross margins to be negatively impacted in and beyond include  but are not limited to the following decrease in average selling prices  costs associated with the continued transition of our high volume manufacturing to our new china facility  including costs incurred to operate duplicate manufacturing facilities and increased shipping and related costs  unanticipated costs to comply with our customers strict and extensive requirements  especially related to our china transition and move to tier asian suppliers  cost reduction programs initiated by semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers that negatively impact our average selling price  warranty costs in excess of historical rates and our expectations  increased levels of excess and obsolete inventory  either due to market conditions  the introduction of new products by our competitors  or our decision to discontinue certain product lines  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates that might affect our costs 
research and development the market for our subsystems for vacuum process systems and related accessories is characterized by ongoing technological changes 
we believe that continued and timely development of new highly differentiated products and enhancements to existing products to support oem requirements is necessary for us to maintain a competitive position in the markets we serve 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development projects and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers and other industry leaders in order to remain responsive to their product requirements 
we believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets  and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development activities 
since our inception  all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses decreased from in to in and to in  due primarily to the higher sales base 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increases in payroll and depreciation of equipment used for new product development 
we expect our research and development expenses to decrease from in dollar terms  primarily due to less engineering support needed in connection with our transition of high volume product manufacturing to china and a refocusing of our efforts on the critical platforms that we expect to need in the next few years 

table of contents selling  general and administrative our selling expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  and other selling and marketing activities 
we constantly monitor our sales and marketing levels to meet current industry conditions 
our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  patent  tax  financial  corporate governance  administrative  information systems and human resource functions in addition to our general management 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased from in to in and to in due to the increasing sales base and our cost reduction measures  including the closures of certain locations in each year 
partially offsetting the decrease as a percentage of sales from to  is an increase in selling expense in of million due to a change in accounting estimate related to our demonstration equipment 
during the fourth quarter  as a result of the continuing process of obtaining and analyzing historical data and our plan for use of the current and future demonstration equipment  we made a change in the estimated useful life of the demonstration equipment 
as a result of this change in estimate  the net book value of demonstration equipment was written off to sg a expense  and going forward  rather than amortizing this equipment to sg a expense over two years  the expense will be recorded as the demonstration equipment is placed into service at our customers or potential customers location 
we do not expect this change to have a material impact on our operating results going forward 
patent litigation expenses from through have comprised a portion of our sg a expenses 
in addition to litigation damages paid to mks as described below  we have recorded legal fees and expenses related to litigation with mks and others of approximately to of our total sg a expenses for each of the three years in the period ended december  litigation damages during  we recorded a charge of million pertaining to damages awarded by a jury in a patent infringement case in which we were the defendant 
the applied science and technology  or astex  division of mks instruments  inc mks was the plaintiff in the case  which was tried in a delaware court 
sales of the product in question have accounted for less than five percent of our total sales each year since the product s introduction 
we entered into a settlement agreement with mks allowing us to sell the infringing product to one of our customers subsequent to the date of the jury award 
under the settlement agreement  royalties payable to mks from sales of the infringing product were not material in and restructuring charges we recorded restructuring charges totaling million in  primarily associated with changes in operations designed to reduce redundancies and better align our mass flow controller business acquired in january within our operating framework 
our restructuring plans and associated costs consisted of million to close and consolidate certain manufacturing facilities  and million for related headcount reductions of approximately employees 

table of contents at the end of  we announced major changes in our operations to occur through these included establishing the manufacturing location in china  consolidating worldwide sales forces  a move to tier asian suppliers  and the intention to close or sell certain facilities 
associated with the above plan  we recognized restructuring charges of approximately million during these charges consisted of the recognition of expense for involuntary employee termination benefits for employees in our united states operations  voluntary employee termination benefits  primarily in our japanese operations for employees  and asset impairments incurred as a result of closing our longmont  co manufacturing facilities 
during  in conjunction with our continuing progress in transitioning our high volume manufacturing to shenzhen  china  we recorded million of restructuring charges  primarily attributable to employee severance and termination costs for employees in the fort collins facility 
these headcount reductions will be offset  in part  by new hires in the shenzhen  china facility 
additional restructuring charges approximating million are expected in the first half of  related to employee severance and termination costs incurred for approximately employees in the hajiochi  japan facility  as manufacturing from this facility is also being transferred to shenzhen  china 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairments whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we perform tests for impairment of these assets and record impairment charges  as necessary 
such events or circumstances include downturns or anticipated downturns in the industries in which we serve  changes in customer technology requirements  and other changes in circumstances affecting the underlying value of the recorded asset 
we recorded impairment charges of our amortizable intangible assets of million in  million in and million in other income expense other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
interest income was approximately million in and and million in the decline in interest income from to was due to our lower level of investment in marketable securities and the overall lower rate of interest paid on our investments which resulted from the federal reserve lowering interest rates during the period 
the average rate of return on our marketable securities decreased from in to in during  we sold approximately million of marketable securities to fund our operations  capital expenditures and payments on our senior borrowings 
from to  the decrease in our level of investment in marketable securities was offset by increased rates of return 
the rate of return on our marketable securities increased from an average of in to in during  we sold approximately million of marketable securities to fund our operations  capital expenditures and payments on our senior borrowings 
interest expense consists principally of interest on our convertible subordinated notes  amortization of our deferred offering costs on these notes  and bank loans and capital leases assumed in the acquisition of aera in january interest expense was approximately million in  million in and million in interest expense decreased from to due to the repurchase of approximately million of our convertible subordinated notes and million of our convertible subordinated notes in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of and due to the repayment of approximately million of senior borrowings and capital lease obligations during interest expense decreased from to due to the repayment of approximately million of senior borrowings and capital leases during  offset in part by a new borrowing of approximately million 
our foreign subsidiaries sales are primarily denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we recorded net foreign currency gains of million in   in and million in our foreign currency gain in was primarily related to an intercompany loan of japanese yen  which was settled in january that we made to our wholly owned subsidiary advanced energy japan kk  which has a functional currency of yen  for the purpose of effecting the acquisition of aera 
the loan was transacted in the first quarter of  for approximately billion yen  approximately million based upon an exchange rate of during the first half of that year  the us dollar weakened significantly against the yen to approximately  resulting in a gain of million 
in july and september  we entered into various foreign currency forward contracts with our primary banks to mitigate the effects of potential future currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the yen until the associated intercompany obligations were settled 
in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased approximately million of our convertible subordinated notes and million of our convertible subordinated notes in the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
these purchases resulted in a gain of million 
net miscellaneous income of million was recorded in  primarily due to the gain on sale of marketable equity securities of  and the sale of our noah chiller business for a gain of  net miscellaneous expense items were  in and million in net miscellaneous expense in and was primarily related to the impairment of a marketable equity security 
during the fourth quarter of  the fair value of this security continued a substantial decline  and we determined the decline was other than temporary as defined by the financial accounting standards board 
as a result we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
in the first quarter of  this security continued to decline in value  and we recorded an additional impairment charge of  since the first quarter of  the value of this security has appreciated  however the increase in the fair value of this security will not be reflected in income until the security is sold 
provision benefit for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  computed at current tax rates  as well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
during  we recorded valuation allowances against certain of our united states and foreign net deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we have incurred significant losses in  and given such experience  management could not conclude that it was more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  our management  in accordance with sfas no 
 in evaluating the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets  was required to place greater weight on our historical results as compared to projections regarding future taxable income 

table of contents if we generate future taxable income  or should we be able to conclude that sufficient taxable income is reasonably assured based on profitable operations  in the appropriate tax jurisdictions  against which these tax attributes may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense will be reported in future periods 
a portion of the valuation allowance relates to the benefit from stock based compensation 
any reversal of valuation allowance from this item will be reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
the income tax provision of million for represented an effective tax rate of negative and the income tax provision of million for represented an effective tax rate of negative  due to taxable income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax benefit of million for represented an effective tax rate of when recording acquisitions  we have recorded valuation allowances due to the uncertainty related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets existing at the acquisition dates 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
reversals of valuation allowances recorded in purchase accounting will be reflected as a reduction of goodwill in the period of reversal 
for the year ended december   valuation allowances established in purchase accounting were reversed with a corresponding reduction in goodwill of approximately million 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor capital equipment industry as well as the other industries in which our customers operate  and the sudden changes resulting in severe downturns and upturns  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our levels of operating expenditures are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues that such expenses support 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results may be adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  and a credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding at december  advances under the revolving line of credit would bear interest at the prime rate minus at march  
any advances under this revolving line of credit will be due and payable in may we are subject to covenants on our line of credit that provide certain restrictions related to working capital  net worth  acquisitions and payment and declaration of dividends 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  during  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to use in operations  capital expenditures and senior borrowing repayments 
due to the same uses  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million from million at december  to million at december  in  when our convertible subordinated notes become due  it is possible we may need substantial funds to repay such debt  which totaled million at december  our convertible subordinated notes with a principal balance of million are due september   and our convertible subordinated notes with a principal balance of million are due november  we will be required to repay the notes at maturity  unless we can refinance the debt or the noteholders convert their notes into common stock before the maturity dates 
noteholders will be unlikely to convert their notes unless our stock price rises above the conversion levels of the notes 
our convertible subordinated notes are convertible into common stock at per share  and our convertible subordinated notes are convertible into common stock at per share 
at march   the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market was per share 
we therefore do not expect the noteholders to convert their notes prior to maturity 
as a result  we are exploring ways to refinance the notes  as well as potential sales of assets that are not critical to our core operations 

table of contents to address our liquidity requirements  we have set a goal to reduce our quarterly operating breakeven point to a level based upon million to million sales  after our transition to china based manufacturing and to tier asian suppliers is complete  which we estimate to occur by the end of additionally  we may raise capital through the public or private markets during by issuing common stock or convertible debt securities  or a combination of the two 
such proceeds will be used to realign our capital structure and provide liquidity for the next semiconductor capital equipment up cycle 
however  we cannot provide assurance that such sources of liquidity will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we have historically financed our operations and capital requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations  the issuance of long term debt and common stock  bank loans  capital lease obligations and operating leases 
however  with the exception of the second quarter of  we have not generated positive cash flow from operations since operating activities used cash of million in  reflecting our net loss of million partially offset by non cash items of million and increased by net working capital changes of approximately million 
non cash items primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of million and increased provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
net working capital changes primarily consisted of a million related to increased inventory excluding inventory reserve increases  million related to increased trade accounts receivable and million related to decreased trade accounts payable 
investing activities provided cash of million in  which primarily consisted of million from proceeds on the sale of marketable securities  offset by million for the purchase of property and equipment 
we expect to make between million and million of capital expenditures in  due in part to our continued investment in our manufacturing operations as well as our information technology infrastructure 
our planned level of capital expenditures is subject to frequent revisions as our business experiences sudden changes and as we move into industry upturns and downturns and expected sales levels change 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may significantly impact our capital expenditures in a particular period 
investing cash flows experience significant fluctuations from year to year as we buy and sell marketable securities  which we convert to cash to fund strategic investments and our current operations  and as we transfer cash into marketable securities when we attain levels of cash that are greater than needed for current operations 
however  we do not expect to generate significant levels of cash that are greater than needed for our current operations in the near term 
financing activities used cash of million in  which primarily consisted of payments on our senior borrowings and capital lease obligations of million  partially offset by million from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and million from the proceeds of a senior borrowing used to purchase a building in south korea 
we expect our financing activities to continue to fluctuate in the future 
if market conditions and our financial position are deemed appropriate  we may repurchase additional convertible notes in the open market 
our payments under capital lease obligations and senior borrowings may also increase in the future if we enter into additional capital lease obligations or change the level of our bank financing 
our estimated payments under capital lease obligations and senior borrowings during will be approximately million 
however  a significant portion of these obligations are held in countries other than the united states  therefore  future foreign 
table of contents currency fluctuations  especially between the us dollar and the yen  could cause significant fluctuations in our estimated payment obligations 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future payments due under significant off balance sheet arrangements  long term debt and capital lease obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total convertible subordinated notes senior borrowings capital lease obligations operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations total obligations cash requirements for interest on these notes approximate million annually 
please refer to note convertible subordinated notes payable  note senior borrowings  note commitments and contingencies and note related party transactions included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion regarding our significant off balance sheet arrangements  long term debt and capital lease obligations 
our inventory purchase obligations consist of minimum purchase commitments we entered into to ensure we have an adequate supply of critical components to meet the demand of our customers 
we believe that these inventory purchases will be consumed in our on going operations during the respective years of purchase commitment 
we have also committed to advance up to  to a privately held company in exchange for an exclusive intellectual property license 
the amount and timing of this advance is dependent upon the privately held company achieving certain development milestones 
as of december   approximately  has been advanced under this agreement  which was recorded within research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
recent acquisitions on january   we acquired aera japan limited  or aera  a privately held japanese corporation 
aera supplies the semiconductor capital equipment industry with product lines that include digital mass flow controllers  thermal based mass flow controllers  pressure based mass flow controllers  liquid mass flow controllers and liquid vapor delivery systems 
aera provides us with a key leadership position in the gas delivery market 
in addition  aera s products expand our offering of critical subsystem solutions that enable the plasma based manufacturing processes used in the manufacture of semiconductors 
on march   we acquired dressler hf technik gmbh  or dressler  a privately owned stolberg  germany based provider of power supplies and matching networks 
we acquired dressler to expand our product offerings to customers in the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel equipment markets with dressler s power product portfolio that includes a wide range of power levels and radio frequencies 
in addition  with inroads already made into the laser and medical markets  dressler enables us to explore new market opportunities 
dressler also strengthens our presence in the european marketplace and has well established relationships with many european customers  who look to dressler for innovative technical capability  high quality products  and highly responsive customer service 

table of contents the results of operations of these acquired companies are included in our consolidated statements of operations as of and since the date of acquisition 
the pro forma results for the company  aera and dressler for the year ended december   assuming the acquisitions of aera and dressler occurred on january   are not presented as the difference between the pro forma results and actual results are not material 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes under part ii  item of this form k and believe that our accounting policies are reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  are most critical as they relate to our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s standard shipping term is freight on board fob shipping point  for which revenue is recognized upon shipment of its products  at which time title passes to the customer  the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured 
for certain customers  the company has fob destination terms  for which revenue is recognized upon receipt of the products by the customer  at which time title passes to the customer  the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  the company does not have obligations to its customers after its products are shipped under fob shipping point terms or after its products are received by the customer under fob destination terms  other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
in limited instances the company provides installation of its products 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company allocates revenue based on the fair value of the delivered item  generally the product  and the undelivered item  installation  based on their respective fair values 
revenue related to the undelivered item is deferred until the services have been completed 
in certain limited instances  some of the company s customers have negotiated product acceptance provisions relative to specific orders 
under these circumstances  the company defers revenue recognition until the related acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
revenue deferrals are reported as customer deposits and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet 
in certain instances  the company requires its customers to pay for a portion or all of their purchases prior to the company building or shipping these products 
cash payments received prior to shipment are recorded as customer deposits and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets  and then recognized as revenue upon shipment of the products 
the company does not offer price protections to its customers or allow returns  unless covered by its normal policy for repair of defective products 
warranty policy the company offers warranty coverage for its products  typically ranging from to months after shipment 
the company estimates the anticipated costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical cost of the repairs and expected failure rates 
the assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of 
table of contents actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
the company s determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is subjective and based on estimates 
the industries in which the company operates are subject to rapid technological change and  as a result  the company periodically introduces newer  more complex products  which tend to result in increased warranty costs 
estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product  and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
excess and obsolete inventory inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete  generally due to engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line  or when it is deemed excess 
judgment by management is necessary in estimating the net realizable value of inventory based primarily upon forecasts of product demand 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded  as necessary  within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation at december   the company had three active stock based compensation plans  which are more fully described in note within part ii  item the company accounts for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
apb opinion no 
requires the use of the intrinsic value method  which measures compensation cost as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
with the exception of certain options granted in and by a shareholder of sekidenko  inc  prior to its acquisition by the company which was accounted for as a pooling of interests  all options granted under these plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  therefore no stock based compensation cost is reflected in the company s net loss 
the company makes disclosures of pro forma net loss and loss per share as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure see note within part ii  item 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation  as of the company s third quarter of fiscal year  as further discussed under the heading new accounting pronouncements under note within part ii  item the adoption of this statement may have a significant impact on the company s results of operations as the company will be required to record compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations rather than disclose the impact on the company s results of operations within the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies we are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business 
while we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate potential loss would not be material to our financial position  the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict 
in the event of an adverse outcome  the ultimate potential loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations in a particular quarter 
an unfavorable decision  particularly in patent litigation  could require material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party patent rights 
we accrue loss contingencies in connection with our commitments and contingencies  including litigation  when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to periodic at least annual tests for impairment 
for the periods presented  the company does not have any indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill 
impairment testing is performed in two steps i the company assesses goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of its reporting unit with its carrying value  and ii if potential impairment is indicated because the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount  the company measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
finite lived intangible assets continue to be amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities consisted primarily of commercial paper  municipal bonds and notes and institutional money markets 
these securities are highly liquid 
earnings on our marketable securities are typically invested into similar securities 
in  the rates we earned on our marketable securities averaged approximately on a before tax equivalent basis 
the impact on interest income of a decrease in the average interest rate would have decreased interest income by approximately  in   in and  in interest rate risk on our investment portfolio has decreased since with the decrease in our marketable securities balance  which is primarily attributable to the use of these funds in operations  for the acquisitions of aera in january and dressler in march  and for the repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of the interest rates on our subordinated debt are fixed  specifically  at for the million of our debt that is due in november  and at for the million of our debt that is due in september our offerings of subordinated debt in and increased our fixed interest expense upon each issuance  though interest expense was partially reduced by the repurchases of portions of these offerings 
because these rates are fixed  we believe there is no risk of increased interest expense with regard to these instruments 
the interest rates on the borrowings of one of our foreign subsidiaries are variable and as of december  ranged from to 
we believe a increase in the average interest rate on these instruments would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are generated in countries in asia and europe 
in compared to  the us dollar weakened on average approximately against the japanese yen and against the euro 
it is highly uncertain how currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future 
we have entered into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations in the japanese yen  taiwanese dollar  south korean won and chinese yuan 
the notional amount of our foreign currency contracts at december  was million 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates at december   would be approximately million  which would be essentially offset by corresponding gains related to the underlying assets 
at december  we held foreign currency forward exchange contracts  maturing through january  primarily to purchase us dollars and sell various foreign currencies 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contracts as of december  market notional settlement unrealized in thousands amounts amounts loss gain japanese yen contracts taiwanese dollar contracts south korean won contract chinese yuan contract balance at december  we also have long term non us dollar denominated debt of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a weakening of the us dollar by against the applicable asian currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
we will continue to evaluate various methods to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations when we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars
