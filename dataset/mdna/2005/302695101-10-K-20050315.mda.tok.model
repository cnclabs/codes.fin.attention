item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction fences i commitment and settlement for further information on how the commitment was satisfied 
the rotliegendes is the primary target horizon throughout most of the fences i project area  at depths from approximately  to  meters  except along the extreme southwest portion where the target reservoir is carbonates of the lower permian 
during  we drilled the kleka  our first rotliegendes target  which began producing in early in  we agreed to assign our interest in the kleka well  including accrued gas sales proceeds and proceeds from ongoing production during and to pogc as a credit against our earning requirement in fences i 
by december   we had met our earning requirement without crediting assignment of the kleka well  so we have agreed with pogc not to assign our interest in the kleka well  subject to the completion of formal documentation 
during  we drilled the mieszkow  an exploratory dry hole 
the mieszkow well demonstrated the need to apply modern seismic data processing and to assure careful handling of velocities in seismic data interpretation 
in and  we acquired  processed and interpreted a substantial amount of seismic data 
in january  we entered into a farmout agreement with calenergy gas  the upstream gas business unit of midamerican energy holdings company  whereby calenergy gas had the right  but not the obligation  to earn a interest in the entire fences i project area by spending a total of million  including the cost to drill two wells and certain cash payments to us 
the operating committee approved the zaniemysl prospect as the first well to be drilled under the calenergy gas farmout agreement and drilling commenced in october in february  we announced that the zaniemysl exploratory well in the fences i project area was commercial and encountered approximately net meters feet of porous gas bearing rotliegendes sandstone 
during a drill stem test of the top meters feet of the structure  the well flowed at a stabilized rate of approximately mmcf of gas per day 
total recoverable reserves for the field are estimated at approximately bcf of gas 
together with our partners  pogc and calenergy gas  we have begun development work to build facilities and connect to the pipeline grid through a pipeline to be built by pogc to produce gas from the zaniemysl structure at a permitted rate of mmcf of gas per day 
gas production is scheduled to commence by the end of following completion of the zaniemysl well in early  calenergy gas requested more than a six month extension in which to undertake an additional technical evaluation before committing to an additional exploration well 
we and pogc elected instead to proceed without delay to select a specific drill site in the rusocin prospect in fences i and to proceed with drilling as soon as possible 
accordingly  calenergy gas did not complete its earning requirement and no longer has the right to participate in the fences i project area  except for the approximately  acres surrounding the zaniemysl field referred to as the greater zaniemysl area  or gza 
the gza was established to allow the two companies to put the zaniemysl discovery into production while exploring together for other nearby natural gas opportunities that would have the potential to add economic value to the overall zaniemysl project 
the gza quantifies the acreage earned by calenergy gas at  acres  covering approximately of fences i  and will require calenergy gas to pay  of our share of geological and geophysical work on the gza project 
both companies anticipate additional seismic data acquisition and reprocessing in the expanded project 
we and calenergy gas each hold a interest in the gza  and pogc holds a interest 
outside of the calenergy gas gza  during the second half of  we drilled with pogc the rusocin well  the first well intentionally focused on a stratigraphic trap in the rotliegendes 
in a january initial drill stem test  the well flowed gas from an meter feet section of the rotliegendes sandstone target reservoir 
the top of the rotliegendes was encountered at approximately  meters 
results of the initial drill stem test indicate that the reservoir may extend beyond the mapped faults  suggesting a larger reservoir along the wolsztyn high 
we believe the well may have discovered the lower edge of a pinch out at the top of the rotliegendes sandstone with porosity 
we are testing the rusocin well to determine whether it is commercial 
if warranted  we will propose to pogc  the operator  one or more appraisal wells on the rusocin prospect 
at the same time  we are completing geological and geophysical work on the lugi prospect  another stratigraphic test of the pinch out play 
during the remainder of  we plan to acquire new d seismic data on selected structural prospects as well as along the apparent stratigraphic trap trend  we are also considering acquiring new three dimensional  or d seismic data along the stratigraphic trap trend 
we intend to propose additional wells  both exploratory and appraisal  as our technical staff approves specific projects 
fences ii project area in early  conoco  inc  ruhrgas and pogc drilled a dry hole in the northeast of the fences ii area 
the well  although dry  did confirm the presence of reservoir quality rotliegendes sandstone at a depth of more than  meters  which we believe makes virtually the entire block prospective for rotliegendes  subject to accurate geophysical resolution of the trapping features 
a significant amount of geological and geophysical work that was completed by pogc and conoco before conoco s withdrawal from the project at the end of was made available to us by pogc 
during and  we reprocessed and interpreted approximately  kilometers of d seismic data to complement the  kilometers reprocessed in in order to develop a more complete subsurface model of the rotliegendes and zechstein horizons 
in the second half of  we received operating committee approval to drill the sroda prospect  a structural feature modeled on pogc s radlin field 
although slowed by mechanical problems  drilling operations should conclude in approximately the first quarter of we have identified several other prospects near sroda 
we are also working to identify prospects in adjacent areas on the southeastern end of fences ii and may seek to expand our exploration rights accordingly 
fences iii project area we have assembled the existing seismic data  which includes seismic data on approximately the northern third of the fences iii project area 
we expect to finish reprocessing and interpreting this data in the first quarter of and  if results warrant  plan to acquire new d seismic data in the second and third quarters of to identify leads and prospects that merit drilling 
we also plan to tender in the second quarter of for a multi well drilling contract that will then make it possible for us to drill without delay if and as prospects are approved by our technical group 
wilga project area in january  we announced plans to begin working with pogc to bring the wilga well into production 
the well is expected to produce at a rate of mmcf of gas and bbls of condensate per day when it begins production 
the wilga well was drilled in and as of december   has gross proved reserves of bcf and  barrels of condensate 
effective january   we are the operator of the wilga project area and own an interest 
pogc owns an interest 
prior to january  apache corp 
was the operator and a interest owner in the wilga area 
in connection with its exit from poland  apache relinquished its interest in the wilga area  which then reverted to us and pogc ratably by virtue of our existing agreements with pogc and apache 
exploratory activities in the united states nevada during  we drilled the east inselberg well to a total depth of  feet in a acre lease block near our existing trap spring munson ranch producing area 
the well encountered shows of oil  and we are testing to determine whether it is commercial 
makoil is the operator and owns a working interest  and we own the remaining 
we plan to drill several additional exploratory wells this year in railroad valley near our existing producing properties 
the republic of poland the republic of poland is located in central europe  has a population of approximately million people  and covers an area comparable in size to new mexico 
during  poland peacefully asserted its independence and became a parliamentary democracy 
since  poland has enacted comprehensive economic reform programs and stabilization measures that have enabled it to form a free market economy and turn its economic ties from the east to the west  with most of its current international trade with the countries of the european union and the united states 
the economy has undergone extensive restructuring in the post communist era 
the polish government credits foreign investment as a forceful growth factor in successfully creating a stable free market economy 
since its transition to a market economy and a parliamentary democracy  poland has experienced significant economic growth and political change 
poland has developed and is refining legal  tax and regulatory systems characteristic of parliamentary democracies with interpretation and procedural safeguards 
the polish government has taken steps to harmonize polish legislation with that of the european union  which it joined in may of poland has created an attractive legal framework and fiscal regime for oil and gas exploration by actively encouraging investment by foreign companies to offset its lack of capital to further explore its oil and gas resources 
in july  poland s council of ministers approved a program to restructure and privatize the polish petroleum sector 
so far under this plan  a refinery located in plock has been privatized as a publicly held company with its stock trading on the london and warsaw stock exchanges 
we expect that the gas distribution segments of pogc will be privatized next  followed by the exploration  production and oilfield services segment 
increased participation by western companies using western capital in the oil and gas sector is consistent with the approved privatization policy 
prior to becoming a parliamentary democracy during  the exploration and development of poland s oil and gas resources were hindered by a combination of foreign influence  a centrally controlled economy  limited financial resources  and a lack of modern exploration technology 
as a result  poland is currently a net energy importer 
oil is imported primarily from countries of the former soviet union and the middle east  and gas is imported primarily from russia 
polish properties legal framework general usufruct and concession terms all of our rights in poland have been awarded pursuant to the geological and mining law  which specifies the process for obtaining domestic exploration and exploitation rights 
under the geological and mining law  the concession authority enters into mining usufruct lease agreements that grant the holder the exclusive right to explore for oil and gas in a designated area or to exploit the designated oil and or gas field for a specified period under prescribed terms and conditions 
the holder of the mining usufruct covering exploration must also acquire an exploration concession by applying to the concession authority and providing the opportunity for comment by local governmental authorities 
the concession authority has granted us oil and gas exploration rights on the fences iii and wilga project areas  and has granted pogc oil and gas exploration rights on the fences i and ii project areas 
the agreements divide these areas into blocks  generally containing approximately  acres each 
concessions have been acquired for exploration in all areas that lie within existing usufructs 
the exploration period begins after the date of the last concession signed under each respective usufruct 
we believe all material concession terms have been satisfied to date 
if commercially viable oil or gas is discovered  the concession owner then applies for an exploitation concession  as provided by the usufructs  generally with a term of to years or as long as commercial production continues 
upon the grant of the exploitation concession  the concession owner may become obligated to pay a fee  to be negotiated  but expected to be less than of the market value of the estimated recoverable reserves in place 
the concession owner would also be required to pay a royalty on any production  the amount of which will be set by the council of ministers  within a range established by legislation for the mineral being extracted 
the royalty rate for high methane gas is currently less than per mcf 
this rate could be increased or decreased by the council of ministers to a rate between and per mcf the current statutory minimum and maximum royalty rates 
local governments will receive of any royalties paid on production 
the holder of the exploitation concession must also acquire rights to use the land from the surface owner and could be subject to significant delays in obtaining the consents of local authorities or satisfying other governmental requirements prior to obtaining an exploitation concession 
fences i project area the fences i project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession controlled by pogc 
three producing fields radlin  kleka and kaleje lie within the concession boundary  but are excluded from the fences i concession 
the concession is for a period of six years ending in september and carried certain work requirements during the first three years  all of which have been completed 
fences ii project area the fences ii project area consists of four oil and gas exploration concessions controlled by pogc 
the concessions have expiration dates ranging from july to august  with three year extension rights 
remaining work commitments in the aggregate include acquiring kilometers of d seismic data  kilometers of new d seismic data  reprocessing kilometers of seismic data and drilling four wells 
fences iii project area the fences iii project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession held by us 
several producing fields lie within the concession boundaries  but are excluded from the fences iii project area 
the concession is for a period of six years ending in december and carries a work requirement during the first two years  which includes the reprocessing of kilometers of existing d seismic data  acquiring kilometers of new d seismic data  and analysis and interpretation of existing well data 
beginning in the third year  there is a drilling requirement of one well 
wilga block project area the wilga project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession controlled by us 
all work commitments have been completed 
as of december   all required usufruct concession payments had been made for each of the above project areas 
production  transportation and marketing poland has a network of gas pipelines and crude oil pipelines traversing the country serving major metropolitan  commercial  industrial and gas production areas  including significant portions of our acreage 
poland has a well developed infrastructure of hard surfaced roads and railways over which we believe oil produced could be transported for sale 
there are refineries in gdansk and plock in poland and one in germany near the western polish border that we believe could process crude oil produced in poland 
should we choose to export any oil or gas we produce  we will be required to obtain prior governmental approval 
during early  we and pogc constructed a pipeline from the kleka well approximately four kilometers to pogc s radlin field gas processing facility and began selling gas produced to pogc at a price of per mmbtu under a five year contract that may be terminated by us with a day written notice 
as part of our restructured agreement with pogc  we agreed in to assign our interest in the kleka well  including amounts representing unpaid gas sales  to pogc to reduce our outstanding obligation to pogc 
accordingly  we received no net gas production from the kleka well in and see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction fences i commitment and settlement for further information concerning the kleka well

we sell oil at posted field prices to one of several purchasers in each of our production areas 
in july  we began selling the majority of our montana production  which represents over of our total oil sales  to cenex  a regional refiner and marketer 
from june through june  we sold our montana production to plains marketing canada lp for the first half of the bulk of our total oil sales were also to cenex 
posted prices are generally competitive among crude oil purchasers 
our crude oil sales contracts may be terminated by either party upon days notice 
oilfield services drilling rig and well servicing equipment in montana  we perform  through our drilling subsidiary  fx drilling company  inc  a variety of third party contract oilfield services  including drilling  workovers  location work  cementing and acidizing

proved reserves proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reserves under existing economic and operating conditions 
our proved oil and gas reserve quantities and values are based on estimates prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
operating costs  production taxes and development costs were deducted in determining the quantity and value information 
such costs were estimated based on current costs and were not adjusted to anticipate increases due to inflation or other factors 
no price escalations were assumed and no amounts were deducted for general overhead  depreciation  depletion and amortization  interest expense and income taxes 
the proved reserve quantity and value information is based on the weighted average price on december   of per bbl for oil in the united states and per bbl of oil and per mcf of gas in poland 
the determination of oil and gas reserves is based on estimates and is highly complex and interpretive  as there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves  projecting future rates of production and timing and amount of development expenditures 
the estimated present value  discounted at per annum  of the future net cash flows  or pv value  was determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosure about oil and gas activities  and sec guidelines 
our proved reserve estimates are subject to continuing revisions as additional information becomes available or assumptions change 
estimates of our proved united states oil reserves were prepared by larry krause consulting  an independent engineering firm in billings  montana 
estimates of our proved polish gas reserves were prepared by troy ikoda limited  an independent engineering firm in the united kingdom

government regulation poland our activities in poland are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties  including the adoption of new laws  regulations or administrative policies that may adversely affect us or the terms of our exploration or production rights  political instability and changes in government or public or administrative policies  export and transportation tariffs and local and national taxes  foreign exchange and currency restrictions and fluctuations  repatriation limitations  inflation  environmental regulations and other matters 
these operations in poland are subject to the geological and mining law dated as of september   and the protection and management of the environment act dated as of january   which are the current primary statutes governing environmental protection 
agreements with the government of poland respecting our areas create certain standards to be met regarding environmental protection 
participants in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities generally are required to adhere to good international petroleum industry practices  including practices relating to the protection of the environment  and prepare and submit geological work plans  with specific attention to environmental matters  to the appropriate agency of state geological administration for its approval prior to engaging in field operations such as seismic data acquisition  exploratory drilling and field wide development 
poland s regulatory framework respecting environmental protection is not as fully developed and detailed as that which exists in the united states 
we intend to conduct our operations in poland in accordance with good international petroleum industry practices and  as they develop  polish requirements 
as poland continues to progress towards its stated goal of becoming a member of the european union  it is expected to pass further legislation aimed at harmonizing polish environmental law with that of the european union 
the european union treaty of accession will require divestment by the polish government of certain portions of the oil and gas business 
changes in the industry ownership may affect the business climate where we operate 
united states state and local regulation of drilling and production our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
our oil production is affected to some degree by state regulations 
states in which we operate have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and gas  including provisions regarding deliverability 
such statutes and related regulations are generally intended to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and gas between owners of a common reservoir 
certain state regulatory authorities also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit 
environmental regulations the federal government and various state and local governments have adopted laws and regulations regarding the control of contamination of the environment 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit by operators before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
these laws and regulations may also increase the costs of drilling and operation of wells 
we may also be held liable for the costs of removal and damages arising out of a pollution incident to the extent set forth in the federal water pollution control act  as amended by the oil pollution act of  or opa in addition  we may be subject to other civil claims arising out of any such incident 
as with any owner of property  we are also subject to clean up costs and liability for hazardous materials  asbestos or any other toxic or hazardous substance that may exist on or under any of our properties 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws  rules and regulations and that continued compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
furthermore  we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than our competitors in the oil and gas industry 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances 
under cercla  such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources  and for the costs of certain health studies 
furthermore  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  and regulations promulgated thereunder govern the generation  storage  transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes 
rcra  however  excludes from the definition of hazardous wastes drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development  or production of crude oil  gas or geothermal energy 
because of this exclusion  many of our operations are exempt from rcra regulation 
nevertheless  we must comply with rcra regulations for any of our operations that do not fall within the rcra exclusion 
the opa and related regulations impose a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills 
opa establishes strict liability for owners of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the united states 
while opa liability more typically applies to facilities near substantial bodies of water  at least one district court has held that opa liability can attach if the contamination could enter waters that may flow into navigable waters 
stricter standards in environmental legislation may be imposed on the oil and gas industry in the future  such as proposals made in congress and at the state level from time to time  that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes and make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling  disposal and clean up requirements 
the impact of any such changes  however  would not likely be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated company involved in oil and gas exploration and production 
federal and indian leases a substantial part of our producing properties in montana consist of oil and gas leases issued by the bureau of land management or by the blackfeet tribe under the supervision of the bureau of indian affairs 
our activities on these properties must comply with rules and orders that regulate aspects of the oil and gas industry  including drilling and operating on leased land and the calculation and payment of royalties to the federal government or the governing indian nation 
our operations on indian lands must also comply with applicable requirements of the governing body of the tribe involved including  in some instances  the employment of tribal members 
we believe we are currently in full compliance with all material provisions of such regulations 
safety and health regulations we must also conduct our operations in accordance with various laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health 
currently  we do not foresee expending material amounts to comply with these occupational safety and health laws and regulations 
however  since such laws and regulations are frequently changed  we are unable to predict the future effect of these laws and regulations 
title to properties we rely on sovereign ownership of exploration rights and mineral interests by the polish government in connection with our activities in poland and have not conducted and do not plan to conduct any independent title examination 
we regularly consult with our polish legal counsel when doing business in poland 
nearly all of our united states working interests are held under leases from third parties 
we typically obtain a title opinion concerning such properties prior to the commencement of drilling operations 
we have obtained such title opinions or other third party review on nearly all of our producing properties  and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all such properties sufficient to meet standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry 
our united states properties are subject to typical burdens  including customary royalty interests and liens for current taxes  but we have concluded that such burdens do not materially interfere with the use of such properties 
further  we believe the economic effects of such burdens have been appropriately reflected in our acquisition cost of such properties and reserve estimates 
title investigation before the acquisition of undeveloped properties is less thorough than that conducted prior to drilling  as is standard practice in the industry 
employees and consultants as of december   we had employees  consisting of seven in salt lake city  utah  in oilmont  montana  one in greenwich  connecticut  three in houston  texas  one in the united kingdom  and one in poland 
our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory 
we also regularly engage technical consultants to provide specific geological  geophysical and other professional services 
our executive officers and other management employees regularly travel to poland to supervise activities conducted by others under contract on our behalf 
offices and facilities our corporate offices  located at highland drive  salt lake city  utah  contain approximately  square feet and are rented at  per month under a month to month agreement

introduction we made important progress on several different fronts in o our drilling program in poland is off to a successful start 
we announced early in that the zaniemysl well encountered approximately net meters feet of porous gas bearing rotliegendes sandstone 
during a drill stem test of the top meters of the structure  the well flowed at a controlled rate of approximately mmcf of gas per day 
together with our partners  pogc and calenergy gas  we have begun development work to build facilities and connect to the pipeline grid through a pipeline to be built by pogc to produce gas from the zaniemysl structure at a permitted rate of mmcf of gas per day 
gas production is scheduled to commence by the end of during the second half of we received operating committee approval to drill the first well focused on a stratigraphic trap in the rotliegendes  the rusocin well 
in january we announced that the well flowed gas in an initial test of an meter section of the rotliegendes sandstone target reservoir 
the top of the rotliegendes was encountered at approximately  meters 
results of the initial drill stem test indicate that the reservoir may extend beyond the mapped faults  suggesting a larger reservoir along the wolsztyn high 
the well found what is believed to be the lower edge of a pinch out at the top of the rotliegendes sandstone with porosity 
we are testing the rusocin well to determine whether it is commercial 
if warranted  we will propose one or more appraisal wells on the rusocin prospect 
at the same time  we are completing geological and geophysical work on the lugi prospect  another stratigraphic test  and expect this well to be the next test of the pinch out play 
during the remainder of  we plan to acquire new d seismic data on selected structural prospects as well as along the stratigraphic trap trend  we are also considering acquiring new d seismic data along the stratigraphic trap trend 
we intend to propose additional wells  both exploratory and appraisal  as our technical staff approves specific prospects 
in the second half of  we also received operating committee approval to drill the sroda prospect  a structural feature modeled on pogc s radlin field 
although slowed by mechanical problems  drilling operations should conclude in the first quarter of we have identified several other prospects near sroda and we are also working to identify prospects on block on the eastern end of fences ii 
for further discussion concerning the zaniemysl well and the fences i and ii areas  see exploration  development and production activities 
o we continued to strengthen our balance sheet  raising a total of million from the sale of common stock through a registered offering and a subsequent private placement and from the exercise of certain warrants and options 
o we satisfied our earning commitments with pogc on both our fences i and fences ii prospect areas 
this means that pogc is now obligated to pay its share of all drilling  seismic  and other qualifying costs as we move forward with our exploration program 
we are committed to pursuing an active exploration program in poland 
at the same time  we recognize that good science takes time  and that our specific goals do not necessarily coincide with those of our partners 
following is a brief discussion concerning some of the significant financial events that have occurred during the past two years 
sales of common and convertible preferred stock we completed a registered offering during april of of  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of  after offering costs of  in august of  we placed privately an additional  shares  resulting in net proceeds of  after offering costs of  in addition  warrant and option holders purchased a total of  shares of common stock during the year  providing an additional  in proceeds 
in march  we sold  shares of series convertible preferred stock in a private placement of securities  raising a total of  after offering costs of  each share of preferred stock was immediately convertible into one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at per share upon registration of the common stock 
the warrants to purchase common stock are exercisable anytime between march   and march   and entitle the holders  for a period of days following any new issuances of equity securities or securities convertible or exercisable into equity securities in other than a public offering  to preserve their approximate ownership subsequent to this offering by purchasing such new securities issued on the same terms as issued to others 
the preferred stock had a liquidation preference equal to the sales price for the shares  which was per share 
the  shares of series convertible preferred stock were converted to our common stock on a one for one basis on october   pursuant to a registration statement that became effective on that date 
between the months of july and november  we sold  units  consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at per share  raising a total of  after offering costs of  the warrants to purchase common stock expire between july   and november  in december  we placed privately  shares of common stock  raising a total of  after offering costs of  approximately million of the net proceeds came from several european investors including banks  mutual funds  life insurance companies and pension funds located in germany  austria  belgium and spain 
fences i commitment and settlement on april   we agreed to spend million of exploration costs on the fences i project area to earn a interest 
when expenditures exceeded million  pogc would be obligated to pay its share of further costs 
through the end of  we had incurred qualifying costs of million 
total qualifying costs incurred during exceeded the remaining million commitment 
these costs included million paid by us through the end of the year towards the rusocin well  million paid by calenergy gas towards the zaniemysl well  and other geological and geophysical costs incurred on the fences i project area 
we have now earned our interest  and pogc is obligated to pay its share of all qualifying project costs 
at december  we had recorded a receivable from pogc related to costs we spent in excess of our commitment requirement in the amount of  in early  we entered into a settlement agreement with pogc to address the methods by which we would satisfy our then existing unpaid liability incurred in connection with meeting our million commitment 
our total unpaid liability  including interest accrued through the end of  was approximately million as of december  as a partial settlement towards our liabilities  pogc agreed to offset approximately  owed to us for prior gas sales from the kleka well 
included in that amount was  of value added tax that will be paid by us to the polish tax authorities  and for which we established a separate liability 
in addition  we paid pogc a total of million in cash 
lastly  we agreed to assign to pogc all of our rights to the kleka well  and the liability was to be further offset by the value of the remaining gas reserves associated with the well 
as of december   our share of the kleka well had estimated proved developed producing gas reserves with an estimated net present value  discounted at  of approximately million  as determined by an independent engineer 
upon completion of the assignment of the kleka well  our previously unpaid liability was to have been settled in full 
due to the fact that we have now exceeded our million commitment  we have agreed with pogc not to assign our interest in the kleka well to it 
this agreement will be in formal documentation that we expect to conclude in the first half of  at which time we will be required to pay approximately million in cash to pogc to settle our remaining unpaid liabilities  offset by approximately  in gas production revenue from and  and any overpayment relating to the million earn in 
we would also then begin accruing our share of gas sales from the kleka well 
we will recognize a gain or loss on the settlement equal to the difference between the recorded liability and the actual cash payment 
fences ii commitment under a january agreement  we had the right to earn a interest from pogc  subject to satisfactory completion of our obligations in fences i and our expenditure of million in exploration costs 
we satisfied the expenditure requirements in early by continuing our ongoing d seismic data reprocessing  along with drilling the initial well at the sroda prospect 
we have now earned our interest  and pogc has begun paying its share of all qualifying project costs 
calenergy gas agreement in january  we signed a farmout agreement with calenergy gas holdings ltd  an affiliate of midamerican energy holdings company  for the joint exploration of our fences i project in poland 
under the terms of the agreement  calenergy gas had the right  but not the obligation  to pay of the costs to drill an initial well  and by so doing  earn a interest of our interest in that drilling prospect 
following the completion of the initial well  calenergy gas could elect to terminate the agreement or to drill a second well 
if calenergy gas elected to drill a second well  it would be obligated to pay us million prior to drilling 
calenergy gas would also have been obligated to pay of the costs of drilling a second well to earn interest in that prospect 
following the second well  calenergy gas had the option to acquire of our interest of the entire fences project area by paying to us the sum of million  less the costs of drilling the first two wells and less the cost of any additional geological and geophysical costs it incurred on the fences area 
following completion of the zaniemysl well in early  calenergy gas requested more than a six month extension in which to undertake an additional technical evaluation before committing to an additional exploration well 
we and pogc elected instead to proceed without delay to select a specific drill site in the rusocin prospect in fences i and to proceed with drilling as soon as possible 
as a result of its failure to drill a second well  calenergy gas forfeited the right to participate in other prospects in the fences i area 
in march  we signed a new agreement with calenergy gas expanding the area of the fx calenergy gas joint operations in poland 
calenergy gas had previously earned the acreage covering the zaniemysl gas field by paying the cost to drill the zaniemysl well 
the new agreement covers additional acreage surrounding the zaniemysl field referred to as the greater zaniemysl area  or gza 
the gza was established to allow the two companies to put the zaniemysl discovery into production while exploring together for other nearby natural gas opportunities that would have the potential to add economic value to the overall zaniemysl project 
the gza quantifies the acreage earned by calenergy gas at  acres  covering approximately of fences i  and will require calenergy gas to pay  of our share of geological and geophysical work on the gza project 
both companies anticipate additional seismic data acquisition and reprocessing in the expanded project 
fx energy and calenergy gas each hold a interest in the gza and pogc holds 
all of the qualifying costs related to our interest in the fences i project area that are paid for by calenergy gas were credited against our million earn in agreement with pogc 
gain contingency throughout our operating history in poland  we have been unable to obtain a refund of most of the value added taxes paid in connection with goods and services purchased input vat 
polish tax laws have restricted the refund of input vat for exploration activities to concession holders 
in our case  pogc has traditionally been the concession holder  while we are a working interest owner by virtue of our agreements with pogc 
during  poland joined the european union 
in connection with this activity  certain tax laws have changed  and we believe we may now be entitled to reclaim some or all of the input vat paid since  which totals approximately million at year end exchange rates 
we are preparing the necessary forms to file with appropriate polish tax authorities to obtain a refund of the input vat in question 
should we be successful in reclaiming our historical input vat  we would reduce capital costs for the related input vat  and record a gain for the input vat related to past geological  geophysical  and other costs 
critical accounting policies oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are considered not to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net cash flows determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
as of december   we had capitalized exploratory well costs  pending the determination of proved reserves  of approximately million associated with the rusocin well and million associated with the sroda well in poland  and approximately million associated with the east inselberg well in nevada 
oil and gas reserves engineering estimates of our oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
there are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as proved 
proved reserve estimates are updated at least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
this change is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in related depreciation rates 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense and impairment expense and in disclosing the supplemental standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas properties 
depreciation rates are determined based on estimated proved reserve quantities the denominator and capitalized costs of producing properties the numerator 
producing properties capitalized costs are amortized based on the units of oil or gas produced 
therefore  assuming all other variables are held constant  an increase in estimated proved reserves decreases our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
also  estimated reserves are often used to calculate future cash flows from our oil and gas operations  which serve as an indicator of fair value in determining whether a property is impaired or not 
the larger the estimated reserves  the less likely the property is impaired 
stock based compensation we have chosen to account for stock options granted to employees and directors under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
instead of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
during the second quarter of  two of our officers exercised options to acquire a total of approximately  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  by canceling options to purchase approximately  shares and applying the option equity to pay the exercise price on the options exercised 
the ten year options were due to expire during the second quarter 
in connection with this cashless exercise  we recorded a stock compensation charge of approximately million  which is equal to the difference between the exercise price and fair value of the options on the date of exercise  and a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital 
this noncash transaction had no impact on our working capital  cash flows or stockholders equity 
results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the oil and gas industry the exploration and production segment  or e p  and the oilfield services segment 
direct revenues and costs  including depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  general and administrative costs  or g a  and other income directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion 
dd a  g a  amortization of deferred compensation  interest income  other income  interest expense  and other costs  which are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes  are discussed in their entirety following the segment discussion 
a comparison of the results of operations by business segment and the information regarding nonsegmented items for the years ended december   and  respectively  follows 
further information concerning our business segments can be found in note  business segments  in the financial statements 
exploration and production segment a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil and gas revenues  average oil and gas prices  oil and gas production volumes  and lifting costs per barrel and mcf for the years ended december   and  is set forth in the following table for the year ended december  oil gas oil gas oil gas revenues     percent change versus prior year average price per bbl percent change versus prior year production volumes per bbl     percent change versus prior year 
lifting costs per bbl percent change versus prior year the contract price for gas during was per mmbtu  the produced gas averaged mmbtu per mcf 
lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced 
lifting costs per mcf of gas are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total mcf of gas produced 
lifting costs do not include production taxes 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all oil revenues during the three years were derived from our producing properties in the united states 
during these three years  oil revenues fluctuated primarily due to volatile oil prices and the declining production rates in attributable to the natural production declines of our producing properties 
oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices and by approximately  related to higher oil production 
oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to production declines 
gas revenues 
our gas revenues are derived solely from our polish producing operations 
gas revenues were  for the year ended december  there were no gas revenues during and as part of our fences i settlement with pogc in early  we agreed to assign our interest in the kleka well effective december  along with the related accounts receivable  to pogc in order to conserve cash while reducing the balance of our liability due to pogc 
accordingly  we recorded no gas sales in or gas volumes in reflected a full year of production from the kleka  which began producing in late february lease operating costs 
lease operating costs were million in  million in and million in operating costs in increased by approximately  due to higher value based production taxes  and  due to higher lifting costs as the company incurred costs for new environmental compliance procedures 
operating costs rose from to as higher oil lifting costs offset lower oil and gas production 
operating costs in increased approximately  due to higher lifting costs  offset by approximately  related to lower oil and gas production 
exploration costs 
our exploration efforts are focused in poland  and the expenses consist of geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  exploratory dry holes and oil and gas leasehold impairments 
exploration costs were million   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
limited available capital caused us to curtail our exploration activities in poland in g g costs were million   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during all three years  most of our g g costs were spent on reprocessing and further analyzing seismic data on the fences i and ii areas 
exploratory dry hole costs were   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as part of the abandonment of our pomeranian project area  we were required to plug and abandon the tuchola well in impairments of oil and gas properties were   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the entire impairment related to the kleka well  which was written down to its reserve value  and included both capital costs and related pipeline costs 
during  we incurred an impairment of  in costs associated with the tuchola well 
we also recognized an impairment of million associated with the kleka well  where lower production profiles caused a downward revision in estimates of recoverable future reserves 
dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to is due primarily to the net book value of domestic assets being increased as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective january  the decrease from to is due primarily to certain wells being fully depreciated in oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
activity in the contract drilling industry picked up significantly during  resulting in a increase in oilfield services revenues 
during  the industry was at a virtual standstill in the area where we operate  continuing the slowdown that began in late oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties  and other factors 
oilfield services costs 
oilfield services costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  or   and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
during and  oilfield servicing costs were a higher percentage of oilfield services revenues  as compared to  due to increased downtime and maintenance and repair costs associated with our oilfield servicing equipment 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are directly associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties  and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we spent   and  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during  and  respectively 
nonsegmented items g a costs corporate 
g a costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  in recognition of our limited resources  we aggressively pursued certain cost reduction measures to help conserve capital 
as part of those reductions  most of our employees and directors and some of our consultants reduced their salaries and fees by 
during  we reinstated those salaries and fees 
in addition  in we incurred higher accounting and legal fees as a result of an sec review of our and filings and the submission of several sec registration statements resulting from our stock sales 
in  we were also able to resume many of our activities in poland  which resulted in higher travel costs for the year 
in  g a costs increased as we incurred higher accounting and legal fees for sarbanes oxley section compliance  higher investor relations fees as we moved from the nasdaq smallcap market to the national market  higher salaries and related payroll taxes and benefits as we enlarged our technical staff  and higher consulting fees as we increased our investor relations activities 
stock compensation g a 
during the second quarter of  two of our officers exercised options to acquire a total of approximately  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  by canceling options to purchase approximately  shares and applying the option equity to pay the exercise price on the options exercised 
the ten year options were due to expire during the second quarter 
in connection with this cashless exercise  we recorded a stock compensation charge of approximately million in the second quarter  which is equal to the difference between the exercise price and fair value of the options on the date of exercise  and a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital 
this noncash transaction had no impact on our working capital  cash flows or stockholders equity 
there we no similar transactions in or interest and other income corporate 
interest and other income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to is a direct reflection of significantly higher cash balances available for investment in lower cash balances and interest rates in and reduced our interest income in both years 
during the year ended december   we recorded other income of  pertaining to the amortization of an option premium resulting from granting a third party an option to purchase gas from our properties in poland 
interest expense 
interest expense was   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in march  we began to accrue interest on a million third party obligation at an annual rate of 
from may to september  the loan interest rate increased to 
it was reduced to from october to november  at which time the lender converted its note payable and accrued interest into common stock 
we began accruing interest on our obligation to pogc during  which accounted for interest expense of  and  in and  respectively 
as part of our further restructured agreement with pogc  we stopped accruing interest on the obligation at december  during  we recorded  of imputed interest expense relating to our financing arrangement with the third party lender 
amortization of deferred compensation g a 
amortization of deferred compensation was   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
on april   we extended the term of options to purchase  shares of our common stock that were to expire during for a period of two years  with a one year vesting period in accordance with fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  we incurred noncash deferred compensation costs of  for the april  option extension which was amortized over the one year vesting period from the date of extension 
the deferred costs were all amortized as of december  income taxes 
we incurred net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  issuance of debt securities  and agreements with industry participants that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in return for an interest in our properties 
our cash resources at december   should allow us for the balance of and to carry out our planned exploration program without selling additional equity or farming out our properties 
we may seek to obtain additional funds for future development related capital investments from strategic alliances with other energy or financial participants  the sale of additional securities  project financing  sale of partial property interests  or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
working capital current assets less current liabilities 
our working capital was million as of december   an increase of million from december  the improvement is due primarily to the sale of equity securities  including the exercise of warrants and options discussed earlier 
our current liabilities include million of costs related to our fences i project in poland 
this amount is equal to the estimated value of the remaining gas reserves at the kleka at december   which we agreed to assign to pogc effective december as we have now exceeded our million commitment  we have agreed not to complete that assignment and will instead pay cash to pogc to satisfy the liability 
see fences i commitment and settlement 
operating activities 
we used net cash of million  million  and million in our operating activities during  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses  excluding noncash charges  incurred in those years 
our current liabilities at year end included approximately million in costs related to our drilling activities in poland that were paid in early we made significant progress in reducing our outstanding liabilities during investing activities 
we used net cash of million  million and  in investing activities in  and  respectively 
in we transferred million to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
we also spent million for oil and gas property additions  million of which was related to our polish drilling activities  with the remainder being spent on our domestic properties 
we also spent  upgrading our office equipment and purchasing new oilfield technical software 
during  we used  to pay liabilities associated with oil and gas property additions from prior years 
in  we deposited  with calenergy gas to cover drilling expenses for the zaniemysl well  in the event costs exceeded an agreed upon target amount 
during the second quarter of  we agreed to final drilling costs for the well in an amount that enabled calenergy gas to keep the entire deposit 
accordingly  the total deposit amount was reclassified from other assets to proved property costs 
we also spent  in related to our proved properties and oilfield equipment in the united states 
during  the majority of cash used was for improving our producing oil and gas properties and our well servicing equipment 
financing activities 
we received net cash of million million  and  from our financing activities during  and  respectively 
in we received a total of million in net proceeds from the sale of securities 
in addition  the exercise of warrants and options provided additional proceeds of million 
during  we received a total of million in net proceeds from the sale of securities 
these proceeds were offset by million paid to a third party lender  million of which was a principal payment on its note payable  and  of which was a loan extension fee paid in march we believe our current cash resources  coupled with anticipated future revenues  are sufficient to fund our exploration program through the end of contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we had no significant contractual obligations or commitments as of december  our oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry that can cause severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations  personal injury and loss of life 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our united states operations and rely on the insurance or financial capabilities of our exploration participants in poland 
these measures do not cover risks related to violations of environmental laws or all other risks involved in oil and gas exploration  drilling and production 
we would be adversely affected by a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance or by our inability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no

and clarified arb no 
this interpretation provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity and determine when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and results of operations of a variable interest entity should be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
fin no

based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s price risk realized pricing for our oil production in the united states is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price of oil  subject to gravity and other adjustments for the actual oil sold 
historically  oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility relating to our oil production in the united states is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
we currently have no gas production in poland 
previously  our gas in poland was sold to pogc based on us dollar pricing under a five year contract 
the limited volume and sources of our gas production means we cannot assure uninterruptible production or production in amounts that would be meaningful to industrial users  which may depress the price we may be able to obtain 
there is currently no competitive market for the sale of gas in poland 
accordingly  we expect that the prices we receive for the gas we produce will be lower than would be the case in a competitive setting and may be lower than prevailing western european prices  at least until a fully competitive market develops in poland 
we currently do not engage in any hedging activities or have any derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves against market risks associated with oil and gas price fluctuations  although we may elect to do so if we achieve a significant amount of production in poland 
foreign currency risk we have entered into various agreements in poland  primarily in us dollars or the us dollar equivalent of the polish zloty 
we conduct our day to day business on this basis as well 
the polish zloty is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond our control 
we do not currently engage in hedging transactions to protect ourselves against foreign currency risks  nor do we intend to do so in the immediate future
