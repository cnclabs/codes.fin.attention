item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the company operates two value rental car brands  dollar and thrifty 
the majority of its customers pick up their vehicles at airport locations 
both brands are value priced and the company seeks to be the industry s low cost provider 
leisure customers rent vehicles for longer periods than business customers  on average  providing lower transaction costs 
the company believes its vehicle utilization is consistently higher than that of its competitors 
both dollar and thrifty operate through a network of company owned stores and franchisees 
the majority of the company s revenue is generated from renting vehicles to customers through company owned stores  with lesser amounts generated by fees and leasing revenue from franchisees 
throughout  the company s revenues were positively impacted by stronger rental demand due to increased travel and to franchisee acquisitions 
year over year revenue growth  however  was somewhat tempered by a decrease in revenue per day 
during  total rental day volume increased with same store volume increasing by 
during the third quarter of  travel into florida  a key leisure destination accounting for significant revenues  was negatively impacted by four hurricanes 
airline passenger enplanements  an important driver for airport rental car demand  were up in versus during  the company achieved lower vehicle costs due to increased manufacturer purchase incentives and an improved used car market 
beginning in  the company implemented a single operating company structure organized around functions rather than organized solely around the brand 
this structure focuses on operating both the dollar and thrifty brands with a single management team  sharing systems  vehicles  back office employees and service facilities  where possible 
the company believes this is a more efficient operating model 
the company has combined its information technology systems to gain efficiencies and facilitate additional growth 
the company has made significant progress in transitioning the thrifty business model from a franchise model to a corporate operating model  similar to dollar s business model 
the company s long term strategy is to operate both brands as corporate stores in the top us airport markets  the top eight canadian airport markets and in other key leisure destinations  and to operate through franchisees in the smaller markets and in markets outside the us and canada 
during  the company acquired franchise operations in us and canadian markets and opened two us greenfield locations 
during  rental day volume increased by over in company owned stores as a result of franchisee acquisitions and the opening of greenfield locations 
the company expects to fund all remaining franchisee acquisitions with cash from operations 
the company s profitability is primarily a function of the volume and pricing of rental transactions  utilization of the vehicles and the volume and pricing of vehicles leased to franchisees 
significant changes in the purchase or disposal price of vehicles or interest rates can also have a significant effect on the company s profitability  depending on the ability of the company to adjust pricing and lease rates for these changes 
the company s business requires significant expenditures for vehicles and consequently  requires substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures 
the company expects its ongoing cash flow to exceed cash required to operate the business

vehicle leasing revenue decreased  due to a decrease in the average lease fleet totaling million and to a decrease in the average lease rate totaling million 
the decline in volume was due to fewer vehicles leased to franchisees  which is primarily attributable to the shift of several locations from franchised operations to corporate operations in line with the company s acquisition strategy

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary uses of liquidity are for the purchase of vehicles for its rental and leasing fleets  non vehicle capital expenditures  franchisee acquisitions  share repurchases and for working capital 
the company also uses letters of credit or insurance bonds to secure certain commitments related to airport concession agreements  insurance programs  and for other purposes 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  secured vehicle financing  the revolving credit facility and insurance bonds 
cash generated by operating activities of million for is primarily the result of net income  adjusted for depreciation  favorable tax programs discussed below  which provided the company deferral of tax payments on earnings to future years and the increase in the reserve for public liability and property damage due to retaining risk of loss for insurance claims 
the liquidity necessary for purchasing vehicles is primarily obtained from secured vehicle financing  most of which is asset backed notes  sales proceeds from disposal of used vehicles and cash generated by operating activities 
the asset backed notes require varying levels of credit enhancement or overcollateralization  which are provided by a combination of cash  vehicles and letters of credit 
these letters of credit are provided under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company believes that its cash generated from operations  availability under its revolving credit facility  insurance bonding programs and secured vehicle financing programs are adequate to meet its liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
a portion of the secured vehicle financing is supported by day bank facilities  which are renewable annually 
the renewals of these day bank facilities are expected to close on march  a significant portion of the secured vehicle financing consists of asset backed notes  which have varying maturities through the company generally issues additional notes each year to replace maturing notes and provide for growth in its fleet

the company has experienced some increases during the last few years in the level of credit enhancement or additional collateral required for new asset backed notes and the commercial paper program 
these increased requirements have reduced liquidity available for other corporate purposes 
the company believes it has sufficient resources to meet these requirements 
cash used in investing activities was million 
the principal use of cash in investing activities was the purchase of revenue earning vehicles  which totaled billion  which was partially offset by billion in proceeds from the sale of used revenue earning vehicles 
the company s need for cash to finance vehicles is seasonal and typically peaks in the second and third quarters of the year when fleet levels build to meet seasonal rental demand 
fleet levels are the lowest in the first and fourth quarters when rental demand is at a seasonal low

to qualify for like kind exchange program treatment  the company exchanges through a qualified intermediary vehicles being disposed of with vehicles being purchased allowing the company to carry over the tax basis of vehicles sold to replacement vehicles  with certain adjustments 
the acts have eliminated the payment of most cash income taxes and have allowed the company to carry back benefits to obtain refunds of taxes paid in prior years 
the acts improve the company s liquidity position by increasing cash and cash equivalents due to significantly reduced cash required for tax payments and from refunds of taxes paid in prior years 
the company estimates the like kind exchange program will extend the period in which it will pay reduced cash income taxes beyond  when the bonus depreciation provision included in the acts expired 
the like kind exchange program has significantly increased the amount of cash and investments restricted for the purchase of replacement vehicles  especially during seasonally reduced fleet periods 
at december   restricted cash and investments totaled million and are restricted for the acquisition of revenue earning vehicles and other specified uses as defined under the asset backed note program  the canadian fleet securitization partnership program and the like kind exchange program

revolving credit facility the company has a million senior secured  revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is used to provide working capital borrowings and letters of credit 
the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility is subject to the company s continued compliance with certain covenants  including a covenant that sets the maximum amount the company can spend annually on the acquisition of non vehicle capital assets  and certain financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a limitation on cash dividends and share repurchases 
in early  the company received bank consent which reduced restrictions relating to franchise acquisitions in the revolving credit facility

the revolving credit facility permits letter of credit usage of up to million and working capital borrowings of up to million 
at december   the company had letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility of approximately million and no working capital borrowings 
the company uses letters of credit to support insurance programs  interest rate swaps and asset backed vehicle financing programs 
as of december   the company is in compliance with all covenants 
debt servicing requirements the company will continue to have substantial debt and debt service requirements under its financing arrangements 
as of december   the company s total consolidated debt and other obligations were approximately billion  all of which was secured debt for the purchase of vehicles 
the majority of the company s vehicle debt is issued by special purpose finance entities as described herein all of which are fully consolidated into the company s financial statements 
the company has scheduled annual principal payments of approximately billion in  million in  million in and million in the company intends to use cash generated from operations and from the sale of vehicles for debt service and  subject to restrictions under its debt instruments  to make capital investments and repurchase its shares 
the company has historically repaid its debt and funded its capital investments aside from growth in its rental fleet with cash provided from operations and from the sale of vehicles 
the company has funded growth in its vehicle fleet by incurring additional secured vehicle debt and with cash generated from operations 
the company expects to incur additional debt from time to time to the extent permitted under the terms of its debt instruments 
the company has significant requirements for bonds and letters of credit to support its insurance programs and airport concession obligations 
at december   various insurance companies had issued million in bonds and various banks had issued million in letters of credit to secure these obligations 
interest rate risk the company s results of operations depend significantly on prevailing levels of interest rates because of the large amount of debt it incurs to purchase vehicles 
in addition  the company is exposed to increases in interest rates because a portion of its debt bears interest at floating rates 
the company estimates that  in  approximately of its average debt will bear interest at floating rates 
the amount of the company s financing costs affects the amount the company must charge its customers to be profitable 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation the increased acquisition cost of vehicles is the primary inflationary factor affecting the company 
many of the company s other operating expenses are also expected to increase with inflation 
management does not expect that the effect of inflation on the company s overall operating costs will be greater for the company than for its competitors 
critical accounting policies and estimates as with most companies  the company must exercise judgment in estimating certain costs included in its results of operations 
the more significant items include public liability and property damage the company does self insure or retain a portion of the exposure for losses related to public liability and property damage insurance 
the obligation for public liability and property damage represents an estimate of both reported accident claims not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported  up to the company s risk retention level 
the company records public liability and property damage expense on a monthly basis based on rental volume in relation to historical accident claim experience and trends  projections of ultimate losses  expenses  premiums and administrative costs 
management monitors the adequacy of the liability and monthly accrual rates based on the services of an independent third party actuary and internal analysis of the development of the claim reserves  the accident claim history and rental volume 
since the ultimate disposition of the claims is uncertain  the likelihood of materially different results is possible  but the potential volatility of these estimates is reduced due to the frequency of internal reviews and reviews by the third party actuary and significant historical data available for similar claims 
vehicle depreciation expense the company generally purchases to of its vehicles as program vehicles for which residual values are determined by depreciation rates that are established and guaranteed by the manufacturers 
the remaining to of the company s vehicles are purchased without the benefit of a manufacturer residual value guaranty program 
for these non program vehicles  the company must estimate what the residual values of these vehicles will be at the expected time of disposal to determine monthly depreciation rates by reviewing the projected market value for the vehicles at expected date of disposition and the overall outlook for the used car market 
the company continually evaluates estimated residual values 
differences between actual residual values and those estimated by the company result in a gain or loss on disposal and are recorded as an adjustment to depreciation expense 
the average life of the non program vehicles is seven to nine months and the company has generally experienced gains on disposal 
many factors affect the market value of used cars including increasing use of incentives and zero percent financing by automobile manufacturers for new vehicles  limited or excess supply of used vehicles and overall economic conditions 
the likelihood that the company s estimates could materially change is possible due to the volatility of the used car market 
a one percent change in the expected residual value of non program vehicles sold during would have impacted vehicle depreciation expense  net by million 
bad debt expense the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and charges bad debt expense for estimated losses resulting from the inability of franchisees to make required payments 
management reviews monthly the individual accounts of franchisees with past due balances to determine the likelihood of collectibility and the amount of bad debt expense  if any  required for a particular franchisee 
factors considered include the aging and magnitude of past due amounts  the franchisees operating and credit history  market conditions  operating plan and available collateral 
the company records a reserve for the potential amounts owed by its franchisees that will not be collected when the amount of the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
accounts are typically charged off at the point the company reaches settlement or no longer pursues collection 
the likelihood that results may materially differ from amounts estimated is possible due to circumstances outside the franchisees or the company s control with respect to economic  industry or other external conditions 
in addition  as the company continues to acquire franchisees in larger markets  the corresponding receivables and risk of collectibility from franchisees will continue to decline 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this revised statement establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services focusing primarily on accounting for transactions with employees and carrying forward prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value measurement objective in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb opinion and generally requires measuring the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such costs must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the standard also requires estimating the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
the effective date of sfas no 
r is the first reporting period beginning after june  and the company expects to adopt sfas no 
r effective july  sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
the company plans to adopt the modified prospective method under sfas no 
r as required on july  and does not anticipate the adoption to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company had previously adopted the provisions of sfas no 
beginning january  changing from the intrinsic value based method to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation  electing the prospective treatment option  which required recognition as compensation expense for all future employee awards granted  modified or settled as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
in october  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eitf 
eitf affirms that a business combination between two parties that have a preexisting relationship should be accounted for as a multiple element transaction 
this includes determining how the cost of the combination should be allocated after considering the assets and liabilities that existed between the parties prior to the combination 
eitf is effective for business combinations consummated in reporting periods beginning after october  the company adopted the provisions of eitf beginning january  adoption of eitf will impact the way in which the company accounts for certain business combination transactions through establishing identifiable intangibles  other than goodwill  for reacquired rights to trademarks through the company s acquisitions of franchisee operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended in december fin r an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin r requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities vie s to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss  if any  from the vie s activities  or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
the company believes that its involvement with thrifty national ad qualifies thrifty national ad as a vie with the company representing the primary beneficiary 
consequently  thrifty national ad has been consolidated in the company s financial statements beginning with the quarter ended march  the fair value of the net assets of thrifty national ad of approximately million at march   was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statements of income 
beginning april   the company began consolidating the operating results of thrifty national ad with its operating results 
thrifty national ad is established for the limited purpose of collecting and disbursing funds for advertising and promotion programs for the benefit of the thrifty car rental corporate and franchisee network 
thrifty national ad files its tax returns under the provisions applicable to a trust 
accordingly  there is no tax effect on the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle or on subsequent profits or losses 
the company s estimated maximum exposure to loss as a result of its continuing involvement with thrifty national ad is expected to be minimal as expenditures are managed by thrifty national ad based on receipts 
the company also evaluated its franchisee network as potential vie s subject to possible consolidation 
the company determined that its franchisees met the fin r definition of a business  however  the company did not provide more than half of each franchisee s equity or other financial support  among other qualifying conditions 
therefore  the company believes that its franchisees do not qualify as vie s under fin r and are not required to be consolidated into the company s financial statements 
in october   the company implemented the provisions of eitf no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
under eitf  effective with the amendment to the vehicle supply agreement with daimlerchrysler  the company began accounting for the promotional payments received as a reduction of the cost of the vehicles when acquired and recognized over the lives of the vehicles as a reduction of depreciation expense 
under the new method  the promotional payments are recognized over the to month period during which the related vehicles are cycled through the fleet 
previously  these payments were accrued and amortized on a straight line basis over the month vehicle model year as a reduction in direct vehicle and operating expenses 
as required under eitf  the effect of this change has been accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate 
risk factors expanding upon the factors discussed in the forward looking statements section provided at the beginning of this annual report on form k  the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
in addition  the risks and uncertainties described below are not all inclusive 
unforeseen risks could arise and issues the company now views as minor could become more significant 
if the company is unable to adequately respond to any such risks  the financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
economic conditions the company s results are affected by general economic conditions in the united states and canada 
a decline in general economic activity has historically led to a decline in both business and leisure travel and to lower demand for rental vehicles resulting in lower industry revenues 
the company maintains the flexibility to reduce its rental fleet size in the event of an unexpected reduction in rental demand  which partially offsets the related reduction in revenues 
highly competitive nature of the vehicle rental industry there is intense competition in the vehicle rental industry  particularly with respect to price and service
