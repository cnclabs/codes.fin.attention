general anthracite capital  inc the company  a maryland corporation  is a real estate finance company that invests in high yielding commercial real estate debt 
the company commenced operations on march  the company s primary focus is to invest in a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate loans and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs 
the cmbs that the company purchases are fixed income instruments similar to bonds that carry an interest coupon and stated principal 
the cash flow used to pay the interest and principal on the cmbs comes from a designated pool of first mortgage loans on commercial real estate the underlying loans 
underlying loans are usually originated by commercial banks or investment banks and are secured by a first mortgage on office buildings  retail centers  apartment buildings  hotels and other types of commercial real estate 
a typical loan pool may contain several hundred loans with principal amounts of as little as  to over  the pooling concept also permits significant geographic diversification 
converting loans into cmbs in this fashion allows investors to purchase these securities in global capital markets and to participate in the commercial real estate sector with significant diversification among property types  sizes and locations in one fixed income investment 
the type of cmbs issued from a typical loan pool is generally broken down by credit rating 
the highest rated cmbs will receive payments of principal first and is therefore least exposed to the credit performance of the underlying loan 
these securities will carry a credit rating of aaa and will be issued with a principal amount that represents some portion of the total principal amount of the underlying loan pool 
the cmbs that receive principal payments last are generally rated below investment grade bb or lower 
as the last to receive principal these cmbs are also the first to absorb any credit losses incurred in the underlying loan pool 
the principal amount of these below investment grade classes generally represents of the principal of the underlying loan pools 
the investor that owns the lowest rated  or non rated  cmbs class is designated as the controlling class representative for the underlying loan pool 
this designation allows the holder to assert a significant degree of control over any workouts or foreclosures of defaulted underlying loans 
these securities are generally issued with a high yield to compensate for the credit risk inherent in owning the cmbs class which is the first to absorb losses 
the company s high yield commercial real estate loan strategy is based on a similar concept of investing in a portion of the principal and interest of a specific loan instead of a pool of loans as in cmbs 
in this case the principal amount of a single loan is separated into a senior interest a note and a junior interest b note 
prior to a borrower default  the a note and the b note receive principal and interest pari passu  however after a borrower default  the a note would receive its principal and interest first and the b note would absorb the credit losses that occur  if any  up to the full amount of its principal 
the b note holder generally has certain rights to control workouts or foreclosures 
the company invests in b notes as they provide higher yields with a degree of control over dispositions 
the company also invests in mezzanine loans on commercial real estate 
the ownership interests in an entity that owns real estate secure mezzanine loans 
these loans are generally subordinated to a first mortgage and would absorb a credit loss prior to the senior mortgage holder

the company considers the cmbs securities where it maintains the right to control the foreclosure workout process on the underlying loans its controlling class cmbs controlling class 
the company divides its below investment grade cmbs investment activity into two portfolios controlling class cmbs and other below investment grade cmbs 
commercial mortgage loan pools and commercial real estate securities portfolio activity the company continues to increase its investments in commercial real estate securities 
commercial real estate securities include cmbs  investment grade real estate investment trusts reit debt and collateralized debt obligation cdo investments 
during the year ended december   the company increased its commercial real estate securities portfolio by from  to  this increase was primarily attributable to the purchase of subordinated cmbs and investment grade cmbs that have a market value as of december  of  and  respectively 
during the second quarter of  the company acquired subordinated cmbs in a trust establishing a controlling class interest 
as the controlling class holder  the company has the ability to control dispositions or workouts of any defaulted loans in this trust 
the company negotiated for and obtained a greater degree of discretion over the disposition of the commercial mortgage loans than is typically granted to the special servicer 
as a result of this expanded discretion  financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities revised december fin r requires the company to consolidate the net assets and results of operations of the trust 
the cmbs securities acquired by the company had a par value of  with  not rated and the balance rated bbb to b 
during the third quarter of the company sold the bbb rated security  which had the impact of increasing the borrowings for the commercial loan pool by  as of december   the cmbs securities owned by the company have a par value of the debt associated with the real estate mortgage investment conduit remic trust is non recourse to the company  and is secured only by the commercial mortgage loan pools 
as of december   the consolidation of the remic trust results in an increase in the company s total debt to capital ratio from to  but has no effect on the company s recourse debt to capital ratio 
the company received authorization from its lenders to permit debt to capital ratios in excess of existing covenants 
approximately of the par amount of the commercial mortgage loan pool is comprised of loans that are shadow rated a or better by moody s investors service  inc and aa by standard poor s rating group  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc the company has taken into account the credit quality of the underlying loans in formulating its loss assumptions 
credit losses assumed on the entire pool are of the principal balance  or of the unrated principal balance 
for income recognition purposes  the company accounts for the unrated commercial mortgage loans in the pool as a single asset based on common credit risk characteristics 
over the life of the commercial mortgage loan pools  the company reviews and updates its loss assumptions to determine the impact on expected cash flows to be collected 
a decrease in estimated cash flows will reduce the amount of interest income recognized in future periods and may result in a loan loss reserve depending upon the severity of the cash flow reductions 
an increase in estimated cash flows will first reduce the loan loss reserve and any additional cash will increase the amount of interest income recorded in future periods 
the company s cdo offerings allow the company to match fund its commercial real estate portfolio by issuing long term debt to finance long term assets 
the cdo debt is non recourse to the company  therefore  the company s losses are limited to its equity investment in the cdo 
the cdo debt is also fully hedged to protect the company from an increase in short term interest rates 
as of december   over of the market value of the company s subordinated cmbs assets are match funded in the company s cdos in this manner

the cmbs portfolio was carried at fair market value of  on the company s consolidated statement of financial condition based on price quotes received from third parties 
the transaction was accounted for as a sale under relevant accounting guidelines 
the company received cash proceeds of  as well as all of the cdo hy preferred shares that had a fair market value of  as of december  the transaction raised re investable proceeds of  the following table summarizes the impact of this transaction on fourth quarter results and per share amounts realized gain at closing of cdo hy  realized gain from subsequent sale of a tranche  increase in accumulated other comprehensive income  total book value impact  below investment grade cmbs and underlying loan performance the company divides its below investment grade cmbs investment activity into two portfolios  controlling class cmbs and other below investment grade cmbs 
the distinction between the two is in the rights the company obtains with its investment in controlling class cmbs 
controlling class rights allow the company to control the workout and or disposition of defaults that occur in the underlying loans 
these securities absorb the first losses realized in the underlying loan pools 
the company s other below investment grade cmbs have no rights associated with its ownership to control the workout and or disposition of underlying loan defaults  however  these investments are not the first to absorb losses in the underlying pools 
the coupon payment on the non rated security can also be reduced for special servicer fees charged to the trust 
the next highest rated security in the structure will then generally be downgraded to non rated and become the first to absorb losses and expenses from that point on

for all of the company s controlling class securities  the company assumes that a total of of the original loan balance will not be recoverable 
this estimate was developed based on an analysis of individual loan characteristics and prevailing market conditions at the time of origination 
this loss estimate equates to cumulative expected defaults of approximately over the life of the portfolio and an average assumed loss severity of of the defaulted loan balance 
all estimated workout expenses including special servicer fees are included in these assumptions 
actual results could differ materially from these estimated results 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of how differences between estimated and actual losses could affect company earnings 
the company monitors credit performance on a monthly basis and debt service coverage ratios on a quarterly basis 
using these and other statistics  the company maintains watch lists for loans that are delinquent thirty days or more and for loans that are not delinquent but have issues that the company s management believes require close monitoring 
during  the company completed a detailed re underwriting of its vintage controlling class cmbs 
upon completion  the company determined that the company s portfolio contained six vintage cmbs securities in four separate cmbs transactions that required impairment charges at december  following the application of eitf as a result  the company recorded a loss on impairment of assets of  in the fourth quarter of a variety of factors influence updated yields for these securities  including magnitude of credit loss  timing of credit loss  prepayments and servicer advances 
the magnitude of credit losses did not significantly change as a result of this process  as total loss expectations on the underlying loans moved from to 
changes in the timing of credit losses and prepayments caused updated yields on these securities to decline by a weighted average of basis points 
market dislocations in caused disproportionate unrealized losses in market value on these securities based on price quotes received from third parties 
the company had recorded these unrealized losses as other comprehensive loss on its consolidated statement of financial condition since that time 
based on current economic conditions and updated credit assumptions  the company believes these vintage cmbs securities will be repaid in full and that the impairment charge of  with respect to five of the six securities will be reflected in income over the remaining life of the bonds 
in addition  the company increased underlying loan loss expectations on one non rated security resulting in an impairment charge of the company considers delinquency information from the lehman brothers conduit guide to be the most relevant benchmark to measure credit performance and market conditions applicable to its controlling class cmbs holdings 
the year of issuance  or vintage year  is important  as older loan pools will tend to have more delinquencies than newly underwritten loans 
the company owns controlling class cmbs issued in      and comparable delinquency statistics referenced by vintage year as a percentage of par outstanding as of december  are shown in the table below vintage year underlying delinquencies lehman brothers collateral outstanding conduit guide total  weighted average based on current principal balance 
morgan stanley also tracks cmbs loan delinquencies for the specific cmbs transactions with more than  of collateral and that have been seasoned for at least one year 
this seasoning criteria will generally adjust for the lower delinquencies that occur in newly originated collateral 
as of december   the morgan stanley index indicated that delinquencies on securitizations were  and as of december   this same index indicated that delinquencies on securitizations were 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks for a detailed discussion of how delinquencies and loan losses affect the company 
delinquencies on the company s cmbs collateral as a percent of principal increased in line with expectations 
the company s aggregate delinquency experience is consistent with comparable data provided in the lehman brothers conduit guide 
of the delinquent loans shown on the chart in note of the consolidated financial statements  loans were real estate owned and being marketed for sale  no loans were in foreclosure  and the remaining loans were in some form of workout negotiations 
aggregate realized losses of  were realized during year ended december  this brings cumulative realized losses to  which is of total estimated losses 
these losses include special servicer and other workout expenses 
this experience to date is in line with the company s loss expectations 
realized losses and special servicer expenses are expected to increase on the underlying loans as the portfolio matures 
special servicer expenses are also expected to increase as portfolios mature 
the company manages its credit risk through disciplined underwriting  diversification  active monitoring of loan performance and exercise of its right to control the workout process for delinquent loans as early as possible 
the company maintains diversification of credit exposures through its underwriting process and can shift its focus in future investments by adjusting the mix of loans in subsequent acquisitions 
the comparative profiles of the loans underlying the company s cmbs by property type as of december  and for the two prior years are as follows exposure exposure exposure property type loan balance of of of total loan balance total loan balance total multifamily    retail    office    lodging    industrial    healthcare    other    total    as of december   the fair market value of the company s holdings of controlling class cmbs is  higher than the adjusted cost for these securities which consists of a gross unrealized gain of  and a gross unrealized loss of  the adjusted purchase price of the company s controlling class cmbs portfolio as of december  represents approximately of its par amount 
the market value of the company s controlling class cmbs portfolio as of december  represents approximately of its par amount 
as the portfolio matures  the company expects to recoup the  of unrealized loss  provided that the credit losses experienced are not greater than the credit losses assumed in the projected cash flow analysis 
as of december   the company believes there has been no material deterioration in the credit quality of its portfolio below current expectations 
as the portfolio matures and expected losses occur  subordination levels of the lower rated classes of a cmbs investment will be reduced 
this may cause the lower rated classes to be downgraded  which would negatively affect their market value and therefore the company s net asset value 
reduced market value will negatively affect the company s ability to finance any such securities that are not financed through a cdo or similar matched funding vehicle 
in some cases  securities held by the company may be upgraded to reflect seasoning of the underlying collateral and thus would increase the market value of the securities 
during the company experienced nine rating upgrades and four rating downgrades on its cmbs 
the company s income calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap for its cmbs securities is computed based upon a yield  which assumes credit losses would occur 
the yield to compute the company s taxable income does not assume there would be credit losses  as a loss can only be deducted for tax purposes when it has occurred 
as a result  for the years through december   the company s gaap income accrued on its cmbs assets was approximately  lower than the taxable income accrued on the cmbs assets 
commercial real estate loan activity the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio generally emphasizes larger transactions located in metropolitan markets  as compared to the typical loan in the cmbs portfolio 
in june  the borrower submitted payment in an attempt to fully repay the loan on a los angeles office building in connection with the borrower s sale of the property 
upon the sale of the property securing this loan  and pursuant to the loan documents  the company was entitled to a supplemental exit fee that was to be paid upon repayment of the loan 
the borrower has refused to pay the supplemental exit fee 
the company filed suit on july  against the co borrowers  mp west fifth mezzanine  llc and mp south olive mezzanine  llc  which are both affiliates of maguire properties  inc nyse mpg 
the suit also names the guarantor  robert f

the following table summarizes the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio by property type as of december    and loan outstanding weighted average december  december  december  coupon property type amount amount amount office    residential    retail   hotel   total    critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the company s accounting policies that are the most affected by management judgments  estimates and assumptions securities available for sale the company has designated certain investments in mortgage backed securities  mortgage related securities and certain other securities as available for sale 
securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
many of these investments are relatively illiquid  and management must estimate their values 
in making these estimates  management generally utilizes market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these securities  but may  under certain circumstances  adjust these valuations based on management s judgment 
changes in the valuations do not affect the company s reported net income or cash flows  but impact stockholders equity and  accordingly  book value per share 
management must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities reflect a decline in value that is other than temporary  and  accordingly  write the impaired security down to its fair value  through earnings 
significant judgment by management is required in this analysis  which includes  but is not limited to  making assumptions regarding the collectability of the principal and interest  net of related expenses  on the underlying loans 
income on these securities is recognized based upon a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
examples include  among other things  the rate and timing of principal payments including prepayments  repurchases  defaults and liquidations  the pass through or coupon rate and interest rate fluctuations 
additional factors that may affect the company s reported interest income on its mortgage securities include interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying mortgage loans  the timing and magnitude of credit losses on the mortgage loans underlying the securities that are a result of the general condition of the real estate market including competition for tenants and their related credit quality and changes in market rental rates 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter the assumptions 
the company recognizes interest income from its purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial interests beneficial interests other than beneficial interests of high credit quality  sufficiently collateralized to ensure that the possibility of credit loss is remote  or that cannot contractually be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the company would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment in accordance with eitf accordingly  on a quarterly basis  when changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  the company calculates a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of the investment including any other than temporary impairments recognized to date and the revised cash flows 
the revised yield is then applied prospectively to recognize interest income 
for other mortgage backed and related mortgage securities  the company accounts for interest income under sfas no 
 using the effective yield method which includes the amortization of discount or premium arising at the time of purchase and the stated or coupon interest payments 
as a result of the closing of cdo i at the end of the first quarter  the company reclassified all of its subordinated cmbs on its consolidated statement of financial condition from available for sale to held to maturity 
the effect of this reclassification changed the accounting basis for these securities  prospectively  from fair market value to adjusted cost 
however  in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 the interest rate swap agreements entered into by the company to hedge the variable rate exposure of the debt of cdo i are required to be presented on the balance sheet at their fair market value 
accordingly  the company determined that at december   and going forward  it would classify all of its subordinated cmbs as available for sale securities and record them at fair market value 
this is consistent with the mark to market requirement for the cdo s interest rate swap agreements 
the reclassification of these securities to available for sale from held to maturity increased the recorded value of these securities from  to  at december  with the difference being recorded in other comprehensive income 
under the various cdo indentures  the collateral administrator to the cdo has an ongoing fiduciary obligation to monitor the credit risk of the collateral securities contributed to the cdo 
the collateral administrator may sell collateral securities that have suffered a credit event such as a rating downgrade or  in the collateral administrator s reasonable business judgment  have a significant risk of declining in credit quality over time 
the company has concluded there are circumstances under the various cdo indentures that permit  and the reasonable exercise of business judgment would warrant  the sale of one or more securities outside the boundaries of paragraph a of sfas no 
the circumstance causing the company to change this classification was not considered a permitted circumstance as stated in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
 and is therefore inconsistent with the company s intent regarding its held to maturity classification 
accordingly  the company s held to maturity classification has been tainted and the company was prohibited from classifying any securities as held to maturity for a period of two years commencing december  securities held for trading the company has designated certain other securities as held for trading 
securities held for trading are also carried at estimated fair value  with changes in fair value included in income 
the valuations of these securities and the interest income recognized are subject to the same uncertainties as those discussed above 
mortgage loans the company purchases and originates commercial mortgage loans to be held as long term investments 
the company also has investments in private opportunity funds that invest in commercial mortgage loans and are managed by the manager 
management must periodically evaluate each loan for possible impairment 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
if a loan were determined to be impaired  the company would establish a reserve for probable losses and a corresponding charge to earnings 
given the nature of the company s loan portfolio and the underlying commercial real estate collateral  significant judgment of management is required in determining impairment and the resulting loan loss allowance  which includes but is not limited to making assumptions regarding the value of the real estate that secures the mortgage loan 
to date  the company has determined that no loan loss allowances have been necessary on the loans in its portfolio or held by the opportunity funds 
real estate joint ventures the company makes investments in real estate entities over which the company exercises significant influence  but not control 
the real estate held by such entities must be regularly reviewed for impairment  and would be written down to its estimated fair value  through earnings  if impairment were determined to exist 
this review involves assumptions about the future operating results of the real estate and market factors  all of which are subjective and difficult to predict 
to date  the company has determined that none of the real estate held by its joint ventures is impaired 
derivative instruments the company utilizes various hedging instruments derivatives to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures or to modify the interest rate or foreign currency characteristics of related company investments 
all derivatives are carried at fair value  generally estimated by management based on valuations provided by the counterparty to the derivative contract 
for accounting purposes  the company s management must decide whether to designate these derivatives as either a hedge of an asset or liability  securities available for sale  securities held for trading  or foreign currency exposure 
this designation decision affects the manner in which the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported 
impairment securities in accordance with sfas no 
 when the estimated fair value of the security classified as available for sale has been below amortized cost for a significant period of time and the company concludes that it no longer has the ability or intent to hold the security for the period of time over which the company expects the values to recover to amortized cost  the investment is written down to its fair value 
the resulting charge is included in income  and a new cost basis is established 
additionally  under eitf  when changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  and the present value of the revised cash flows using the current expected yield is less than the present value of the previously estimated remaining cash flows adjusted for cash receipts during the intervening period  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
accordingly  the security is written down to fair value with the resulting change being included in income  and a new cost basis established 
in both instances  the original discount or premium is written off when the new cost basis is established 
after taking into account the effect of an impairment charge  income is recognized under eitf or sfas no 
 as applicable  using the market yield for the security used in establishing the write down

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service  the requisite service period usually the vesting period  in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  in accordance with the standard  the company will adopt sfas no

fin r addresses the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to variable interest entities vie and generally would require that the assets  liabilities and results of operations of a vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in it 
the interpretation provides a framework for determining whether an entity should be evaluated for consolidation based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to the entity variable interests 
an entity is classified as a vie if total equity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights  absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur or receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
once an entity is determined to be a vie  its assets  liabilities and results of operations should be consolidated with those of its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the entity that either will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or has the right to receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns 
the expected losses and residual returns of a vie include expected variability in its net income or loss  fees to decision makers and fees to guarantors of substantially all vie assets or liabilities and are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting concept no

net interest margin and net interest spread from the portfolio the company considers its portfolio to consist of its securities available for sale  securities held for trading  commercial mortgage loans  and cash and cash equivalents because these assets relate to its core strategy of acquiring and originating high yield loans and securities backed by commercial real estate  while at the same time maintaining a portfolio of investment grade securities to enhance the company s liquidity 
net interest margin from the portfolio is annualized net interest income divided by the average market value of interest earning assets 
net interest income is total interest income less interest expense relating to collateralized borrowings 
net interest spread equals the yield on average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period 
the yield on average assets is interest income divided by average amortized cost of interest earning assets 
the average cost of funds is interest expense from the portfolio divided by average outstanding collateralized borrowings 
the following chart describes the interest income  interest expense  net interest margin and net interest spread for the company s portfolio

hedging instruments from time to time  the company may modify its exposure to market interest rates by entering into various financial instruments that adjust portfolio duration and short term rate exposure 
these financial instruments are intended to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates on the value of the company s assets and the cost of borrowing

capital resources and liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the company s ability to meet cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  loan acquisition and lending activities  and for other general business purposes 
the primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of collateralized borrowings  principal and interest payments on and maturities of securities available for sale  securities held for trading  commercial mortgage loans  and proceeds from the maturity or sales thereof 
the company finances itself with its common equity  follow on common equity offerings  preferred stock offerings  secured term debt  committed financing facilities  and reverse repurchase agreements 
an important part of the company s risk analysis includes a thorough assessment of the financing alternatives in the context of the assets being financed 
reverse repurchase agreements are secured loans generally with a term of days 
the interest rate is based on day libor plus a spread that is determined based on the asset pledged as security 
the terms include a daily mark to market provision that requires the posting of additional collateral if the value of the pledged asset declines 
after the day period expires  there is no obligation for the lender to extend credit for an additional period 
this type of financing is generally available only for more liquid securities 
the interest rate charged on reverse repurchase agreements is usually the lowest relative to the alternatives due to the lower risk inherent in these transactions 
committed financing facilities represent multi year agreements to provide secured financing for a specific asset class 
these facilities include a daily mark to market provision requiring posting of additional collateral if the value of the pledged asset declines in excess of a threshold amount 
a significant difference between committed financing facilities and reverse repurchase agreements is the term of the financing 
a committed facility provider is generally required to provide financing for the full term of the agreement  usually two to three years  rather than thirty days as generally used in the reserve repurchase market 
this longer term makes the financing of less liquid assets viable 
issuance of secured term debt is generally done through a cdo offering 
this entails creating a special purpose entity that holds assets used to secure the payments required of the debt issued 
with the exception of cdo hy  these transactions are considered financings and the special purpose entities spe are fully consolidated on the company s consolidated financial statements 
asset cash flows are generally matched with the debt service requirements over their respective lives and an interest rate swap is used to match the fixed or floating rate nature of the coupon payments where necessary 
this type of transaction is usually referred to as match funding or term financing the assets 
there is no mark to market requirement in this structure and the debt cannot be called or terminated by the bondholders 
furthermore  the debt issued is non recourse to the issuer therefore permanent reductions in value do not affect the liquidity of the company 
however  since the company expects to earn a positive spread between the income generated by the assets and the expense of the debt issued  a permanent impairment of any of the assets would negatively affect the spread over time 
the company may issue preferred stock from time to time as a source of long term or permanent capital 
preferred stock generally has a fixed coupon and may have a fixed term in the form of a maturity date or other redemption or conversion feature 
the preferred stockholder typically has the right to a preferential distribution for dividends and any liquidity proceeds 
another source of permanent capital is the issuance of common stock through a follow on offering 
this allows investors to purchase a large block of common stock in one transaction 
a common stock issuance can be accretive to the company s book value per share if the issue price per share exceeds the company s book value per share 
it can also be accretive to earnings per share if the company deploys the new capital into assets that generate a risk adjusted return that exceeds the return of the company s existing assets 
furthermore  earnings accretion can also be achieved at reinvestment rates that are lower than the return on existing assets if common stock is issued at a premium to book value 
the company continuously evaluates the market for follow on common stock offerings as well as the available opportunities to deploy new capital on an accretive basis 
in  the company issued  shares of common stock in a follow on offering at per share 
during  the company did not issue any common stock in follow on equity offerings 
additionally  for the years ended december  and  respectively  the company issued  and  shares of common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan 
net proceeds to the company were approximately  and  respectively

in addition  at the end of the first quarter of  the board of directors approved the company s decision to redeem its series b preferred stock  par value per share series b preferred stock for  the series b preferred stock was redeemed on may  contingent liability during  the company completed the acquisition of core cap  inc the merger was a stock for stock acquisition where the company issued  shares of its common stock and  shares of its series b preferred stock 
at the time of the core cap acquisition  blackrock financial management  inc the manager agreed to pay gmac core cap  inc s external advisor  over a ten year period installment payment to purchase the right to manage the assets under the existing management contract gmac contract 
the gmac contract had to be terminated in order to allow for the company to complete the merger  as the company s management agreement with the manager did not provide for multiple managers 
as a result the manager offered to buy out the gmac contract as the manager estimated it would receive incremental fees above and beyond the installment payment  and thus was willing to pay for  and separately negotiate  the termination of the gmac contract 
accordingly  the value of the installment payment was not considered in the company s allocation of its purchase price to the net assets acquired in the acquisition of core cap  inc the company agreed that should the management agreement with the manager be terminated  not renewed or not extended for any reason other than for cause  the company would pay to the manager an amount equal to the installment payment less the sum of all payments made by the manager to gmac 
as of december   the installment payment would be  payable over six years 
the company does not accrue for this contingent liability 
transactions with affiliates the company has a management agreement with the manager  a majority owned indirect subsidiary of the pnc financial services group  inc pnc bank and the employer of certain directors and officers of the company  under which the manager manages the company s day to day operations  subject to the direction and oversight of the company s board of directors 
on march   the management agreement was extended for one year through march   with the approval of the unaffiliated directors  on terms similar to the prior agreement with the following changes i the incentive fee calculation would be based on gaap earnings instead of funds from operations  ii the removal of the four year period to value the management agreement in the event of termination and iii subsequent renewal periods of the management agreement would be for one year instead of two years 
houlihan lokey howard zukin financial advisors  inc  a national investment banking and financial advisory firm  advised the board in the renewal process 
on march   the unaffiliated directors approved an extension of the management agreement from its expiration of march  for one year through march  the terms of the renewed agreement were similar to the prior agreement except for the incentive fee calculation that would provide for a rolling four quarter high watermark rather than a quarterly calculation 
in determining the rolling four quarter high watermark  the company would calculate the incentive fee based upon the current and prior three quarters net income 
the manager would be paid an incentive fee in the current quarter if the yearly incentive fee  as defined  were greater than what was paid to the manager in the prior three quarters cumulatively 
the company phased in the rolling four quarter high watermark commencing with the second quarter of calculation of the incentive fee was based on gaap earnings and adjusted to exclude special one time events pursuant to changes in gaap accounting pronouncements after discussion between the manager and the unaffiliated directors 
the incentive fee threshold did not change 
the high watermark provided for the manager to be paid of the amount of earnings calculated in accordance with gaap per share that exceeds the product of the adjusted issue price of the company s common stock per share and the greater of or basis points over the ten year treasury note 
the management agreement was further extended for one year from march  through march  the base management fee was revised to equal of the quarterly average total stockholders equity for the applicable quarter 
the incentive fee was revised to be of the amount of earnings calculated in accordance with gaap per share that exceeds the product of the adjusted issue price of the company s common stock per share as of december  and the greater of or basis points over the ten year treasury note 
on march   the members of the company s board of directors who are not affiliated with the manager approved an extension of the company s management agreement with the manager for one additional year through march  the terms of the extended agreement did not change

the company s unaffiliated directors approved this transaction in september reit status the company has elected to be taxed as a reit and therefore must comply with the provisions of the code with respect thereto 
accordingly  the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to stockholders and as long as certain asset  income  and stock ownership tests are met 
the company may  however  be subject to tax at corporate rates or at excise tax rates on net income or capital gains not distributed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk includes the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk and credit curve risk 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
credit curve risk is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the markets for commercial mortgage securities and other loans and securities held by the company 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
changes in the general level of the us treasury yield curve can have significant effects on the market value of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets are fixed rate securities valued based on a market credit spread to us treasuries 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is increased  the market value of the company s portfolio may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is decreased  the market value of the company s portfolio may increase 
changes in the market value of the company s portfolio may affect the company s net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading or indirectly through their impact on the company s ability to borrow 
changes in the level of the us treasury yield curve can also affect  among other things  the prepayment assumptions used to value certain of the company s securities and the company s ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in addition  changes in the general level of the libor money market rates can affect the company s net interest income 
as of december   all of the company s liabilities outside of the cdos are floating rate based on a market spread to libor 
as the level of libor increases or decreases  the company s interest expense will move in the same direction 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses or increased costs 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  the company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which the company trades may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render the company unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if the company anticipates that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income purposes  the company may conduct part or all of its hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the company monitors and manages interest rate risk based on a method that takes into consideration the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities  including its preferred stock 
the company s objective is to acquire assets and match fund the purchase so that interest rate risk associated with financing these assets is reduced or eliminated 
the primary risks associated with acquiring and financing these assets are mark to market risk and short term rate risk 
examples of these financing types include day repurchase agreements and committed borrowing facilities 
certain secured financing arrangements provide for an advance rate based upon a percentage of the market value of the asset being financed 
market movements that cause asset values to decline would require a margin call or a cash payment to maintain the relationship between asset value and amount borrowed 
a cash flow based cdo is an example of a secured financing vehicle that does not require a mark to market to establish or maintain a level of financing 
when financed assets are subject to a mark to market margin call  the company carefully monitors the interest rate sensitivity of those assets 
the duration of the assets financed which are subject to a mark to market margin call was years based on reported gaap book value as of december  the company s reported book value incorporates the market value of the company s interest bearing assets but it does not incorporate the market value of the company s interest bearing liabilities 
the fixed rate interest bearing liabilities and preferred stock will generally reduce the actual interest rate risk of the company from a pure economic perspective even though changes in the value of these liabilities are not reflected in the company s book value 
the fixed rate liabilities issued in cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii reduce the company s economic duration by approximately years 
the series c preferred stock reduces the company s economic duration by approximately year 
the company s reported book value is not reduced by these liabilities and therefore is approximately years longer than the economic duration 
the company s duration management strategy focuses on the economic risk and maintains economic duration within a band of to years 
at december   economic duration was years 
earnings per share is analyzed using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the libor curve  increase or decrease and that the yield curves of the libor rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
market value in this scenario is calculated using the assumption that the us treasury yield curve remains constant even though changes in both long and short term interest rates can occur simultaneously 
regarding the table below  all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the respective values calculated in the scenario labeled as base case 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in earnings per share given libor movements change in libor  projected change in basis points earnings per share base case credit risk the company s portfolios of commercial real estate assets are subject to a high degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults 
default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the us economy  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
before acquiring a controlling class security  the company will perform an analysis of the quality of all of the loans proposed 
as a result of this analysis  loans with unacceptable risk profiles are either removed from the proposed pool or the company receives a price adjustment 
the company underwrites its controlling class cmbs investments assuming the underlying loans will suffer a certain dollar amount of defaults and these defaults will lead to some level of realized losses 
loss adjusted yields are computed based on these assumptions and applied to each class of security supported by the cash flow on the underlying loans 
the most significant variables affecting loss adjusted yields include  but are not limited to  the number of defaults  the severity of loss that occurs subsequent to a default and the timing of the actual loss 
the different rating levels of cmbs will react differently to changes in these assumptions 
the lowest rated securities b or lower are generally more sensitive to changes in timing of actual losses 
the higher rated securities b or higher are more sensitive to the severity of losses and timing of cashflows 
the company generally assumes that all of the principal of a non rated security and a significant portion  if not all  of ccc and a portion of b rated securities will not be recoverable over time 
the loss adjusted yields of these classes reflect that assumption  therefore  the timing of when the total loss of principal occurs is the most important assumption in determining value 
the interest coupon generated by a security will cease when there is a total loss of its principal regardless of whether that principal is paid 
therefore  timing is of paramount importance because the longer the principal balance remains outstanding  the more interest coupon the holder receives  which results in a larger economic return 
alternatively  if principal is lost faster than originally assumed  there is less opportunity to receive interest coupon  which results in a lower or possibly negative return 
additional losses  which occur due to greater severity  will not have a significant effect as all principal is already assumed to be non recoverable 
if actual principal losses on the underlying loans exceed assumptions  the higher rated securities will be affected more significantly as a loss of principal may not have been assumed 
the company generally assumes that all principal will be recovered by classes rated b or higher 
the company manages credit risk through the underwriting process  establishing loss assumptions and careful monitoring of loan performance 
after the securities have been acquired  the company monitors the performance of the loans  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
factors that indicate a higher loss severity or acceleration of the timing of an expected loss will cause a reduction in the expected yield and therefore reduce the earnings of the company 
furthermore  the company may be required to write down a portion of the adjusted purchase price of the affected assets through its consolidated statements of financial condition 
for purposes of illustration  a doubling of the losses in the company s controlling class cmbs  without a significant acceleration of those losses  would reduce gaap income going forward by approximately per share of common stock per year and cause a significant write down at the time the loss assumption is changed 
the amount of the write down depends on several factors  including which securities are most affected at the time of the write down  but is estimated to be in the range of to per share based on a doubling of expected losses 
a significant acceleration of the timing of these losses would cause the company s net income to decrease 
the company s exposure to a write down is mitigated by the fact that most of these assets are financed on a non recourse basis in the company s cdos  where a significant portion of the risk of loss is transferred to the cdo bondholders 
as of december   securities with a total market value of  are collateralizing the cdo borrowings of  therefore  the company s preferred equity interest in the three cdos is  per share 
the cdo borrowings are not marked to market in accordance with gaap even though their economic value will change in response to changes in interest rates and or credit spreads 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the re pricing and or maturing of assets and liabilities 
it is the company s objective to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match the term of the company s liabilities as closely as possible with the expected holding period of the company s assets 
this is less important for those assets in the company s portfolio considered liquid  as there is a very stable market for the financing of these securities 
other methods for evaluating interest rate risk  such as interest rate sensitivity gap defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within a given time period  are used but are considered of lesser significance in the daily management of the company s portfolio 
management considers this relationship when reviewing the company s hedging strategies 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect the company s net interest income positively or negatively even if the company were to be perfectly matched in each maturity category
