item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview asv designs  manufactures and sells rubber tracked  all purpose crawlers and related accessories and attachments 
asv also manufactures rubber tracked undercarriages  which are a primary component on caterpillar s mtls 
asv s products are able to traverse nearly any terrain with minimal damage to the ground  making them effective in industries such as construction  landscaping and agriculture 
asv distributes its products through an independent dealer network in the united states  canada  australia  new zealand and portugal 
the undercarriages sold to caterpillar are incorporated by caterpillar in its mtl products and sold exclusively through the caterpillar dealer network  primarily in north america 
on october   asv closed on its acquisition of loegering mfg 
inc of casselton  north dakota in a merger transaction 
loegering is a manufacturer of over the tire steel tracks for wheeled skid steers and also provides attachments for the skid steer market 
following completion of the transaction  loegering became a wholly owned subsidiary of asv 
asv experienced a significant increase in sales in due to several reasons as explained below the company believes there is a greater acceptance of rubber track machines in the marketplace as users experience the benefits that a rubber track machine can provide over a standard wheeled machine 
the number of companies entering into the rubber track machine market has increased in the last few years  thereby contributing to the increased awareness and market acceptance of the products 
asv has increased its number of product offerings over the past few years such that it has become easier to attract prospective dealers to carry the r series posi track product line 
caterpillar has increased the number of mtl models it offers to its dealers  from two models in to five in in addition  the number of caterpillar dealers that are able to carry the mtl product line has increased from pilot dealers in to all north american dealers approximately in the current low interest rate environment has provided for easier financing by end users 
recent tax legislation has provided increased depreciation allowances for equipment purchased by the end user prior to january   allowing end users to depreciate a greater portion of machine purchases in the first year of ownership  thereby potentially reducing the cost of machine ownership in the first year of operation 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories and warranty obligations 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and other outside sources and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company has determined that the time of shipment is the most appropriate point to recognize revenue as the risk of loss passes to the customer when placed with a carrier for delivery ie  upon shipment 
any post sale obligations on the part of asv  consisting primarily of warranty obligations  are estimated and accrued for at the time of shipment 
the company generally obtains oral or written purchase authorizations from customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and considers delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
asv maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of asv s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
adjustments to slow moving and obsolete inventories to the lower of cost or market are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
the company does not believe its inventories are subject to rapid obsolescence 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the inventories carrying value quarterly 
warranties 
the company provides limited warranties to purchasers of its products which vary by product 
the warranties generally cover defects in materials and workmanship for one year from the delivery date to the first end user 
the rubber tracks used on the company s products carry a pro rated warranty up to  hours of usage 
while asv engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  asv s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from asv s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
income taxes 
the company records income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for employee stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as opposed to the fair value method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pursuant to the provisions of apb  the company generally does not record an expense for the value of stock based awards granted to employees 
on december   the fasb issued an amendment to sfas no 
 share based payment  sfas no 
r  which will be effective for public companies in periods beginning after june  we are required to implement the proposed standard no later than the quarter that begins july  sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
companies are required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we currently anticipate the effect of adopting sfas no 
r will reduce our diluted earnings per share figure by approximately 
for the six months ended december  for those share based payment transactions in existence as of december  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of earnings data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales gross profit selling  general administrative expense research development operating income net earnings net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  compared with million for this increase was primarily the result of four factors 
first  sales of the company s r series products increased in  due to the addition of two new models in january  a greater number of r series dealers in and a full year of sales of the rc in  which was introduced in the first quarter of second  sales of mtl undercarriages increased in  due to three models of undercarriages being sold for the first nine months of and increased market demand 
in  one undercarriage model was added during the first quarter and  as such  had sales for only a portion of third  sales of service parts more than doubled in due to a greater number of machines and undercarriages in service 
finally  net sales included million of sales from loegering  which was acquired in october the company anticipates its net sales for will be in the range of million based on its current and projected level of orders for its r series posi track products and mtl undercarriages  projected future service parts demand and a full year of sales from loegering 
for the year ended december   net sales totaled million  a increase over net sales for the year ended december  due to several factors 
first  the company had increased shipments of undercarriages to caterpillar for use on caterpillar s mtl product line 
shipments increased as caterpillar had more models available to sell during five compared with two 
in addition  during  caterpillar was unable to sell two models of its mtls due to production issues unrelated to asv s undercarriages 
these production issues were resolved in and these two models were placed back into production  which resulted in increased sales of these models by caterpillar in second  asv introduced a new model to its r series product line  the rc  in the first quarter of this model replaced the model posi track  and the rc experienced three times the unit volume in that the had in also  the company believes the addition of the rc posi track has aided the sales of the company s other models  the rc and rc  as the increased number of product offerings has attracted an increased number of dealers that wish to carry the company s products 
also contributing to the increased sales in was the increase in the sale of service parts as the number of machines and mtl undercarriages continues to increase 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit increased to million  compared with million for  and the gross profit percentage increased from in to in the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increased sales experienced during as discussed above 
the increase in gross profit percentage was due primarily to a shift in the mix of products sold in as the company had increased sales of r series posi track products in over r series products generally carry a higher gross profit percentage than mtl undercarriages 
the company also believes its raw material unit cost reduction project initiated in the first quarter of as well as operational efficiencies obtained from higher production volumes helped increase the gross profit percentage in offsetting these increases were steel surcharges of approximately million in the company experienced no steel surcharges in the company anticipates its gross profit percentage for will be in the range of based on the anticipated sales mix for gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales for the increase in gross profit was due to a combination of increased sales in as discussed above and an increase in the gross profit percentage 
the increase in gross profit percentage was due to two primary factors 
first  the increased sales of asv branded machines  which generally carry a higher gross profit percentage than mtl undercarriages  helped increase the gross profit percentage in second  the company s mix of mtl undercarriages sold in contained a greater number of higher margin undercarriages than was sold in in  the company primarily sold one model of mtl undercarriage to caterpillar  which had the lowest gross profit percentage of the mtl undercarriages selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses was due primarily to increased advertising and promotion to promote the technology benefits of the company s products  increased sales commissions from increased sales of the company s r series products  costs related to the acquisition of loegering mfg 
inc  initial compliance costs related to sarbanes oxley implementation and the overall increase in the volume of the company s business 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to several factors 
first  commissions to asv s sales force increased in due to the increased sales 
second  in the second quarter of  selling  general and administrative expenses were lower than historical levels due primarily to the reversal of a portion of a remarketing reserve during the second quarter of the company had previously established a remarketing reserve of  for any expected costs associated with remarketing existing machines at one customer s locations  some of which were ultimately returned to company 
asv had originally anticipated these machines would be remarketed to other dealers but instead chose to have certain of these machines returned to asv for use in its new rental program which began in the second quarter of as these machines were returned to asv and reflected as sales returns with a corresponding decrease in gross profit of approximately  a portion of the remarketing reserve was no longer needed 
the company reversed the portion of the remarketing reserve that related to the returned machines  which decreased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately  third  payroll taxes increased in due to the exercise of non qualified stock options by employees  which required the payment of the employer portion of payroll taxes by the company 
in  there were no non qualified stock options exercised due to the lower price of the company s common stock 
research and development 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased to million  compared with  for the increase was due primarily to the on going development of new products  including the company s newest r series product  the rcv  which was introduced in january the company anticipates its future spending on research and development activities will focus on additional product offerings and additional applications of its track technology 
research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the completion of the development  testing and integration of the fifth undercarriage used in caterpillar s mtl product line in in  asv incurred research and development expenses of million related to the undercarriages used in caterpillar s mtl product line 
other income expense 
for the year ended december   other income was  compared with  for this increase was due primarily to increased interest income from greater funds available for investment in funds increased in due to proceeds received from the sale of common stock to caterpillar in january  proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options and net earnings generated in and other income for the year ended december  was  compared with  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower interest income from lower interest rates available for the company s cash equivalents and a reduction in royalty revenues received from one of the company s vendors as the royalty agreement expired in net earnings 
for the year ended december   net earnings were million  compared with million for the increase was primarily a result of increased sales with an increased gross profit percentage  offset in part by increased operating expenses 
the company also realized a slightly lower effective income tax rate in due to increased international sales and increased tax credits from increased research and development expenditures in the company anticipates its diluted earnings per share for will be in the range of based on its anticipated sales  gross profit and expense levels for net earnings increased for the year ended december  to million  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase was due to the more than doubling of net sales in  combined with an increased gross profit percentage  offset in part by slightly higher operating expenses  lower non operating income and a higher effective income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   the company s cash and cash equivalents were approximately the same as they were at december  the company generated approximately million of cash from operations 
included in this figure was the significant increase in net earnings the company experienced in due to a increase in sales 
the company also recorded a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of approximately million in  due to an increase in the exercise of employee stock options  a result of the increase in the price of the company s common stock in the company also generated approximately million in cash through increases in current liabilities from increased volume 
partially offsetting the increases in cash were increases in accounts receivable due to a temporary change in payment terms by caterpillar and an increase in inventory levels due to increased production levels 
the company used cash of approximately million in investing activities  primarily due to the purchase of million of long term investments  a net increase in short term investments of million  million of property and equipment and million of cash paid in the loegering acquisition 
the company generated cash of approximately million from financing activities  due primarily to the capital stock transactions with caterpillar in january and the exercise of employee stock options throughout the year 
table of contractual commitments the following table represents the company s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations  operating leases purchase obligations   financing guarantee total    purchase obligations represent the total value of all open purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and components used in the manufacture of the company s products as of december  the company s financing guarantee is described in note j to the financial statements filed in connection with this annual report on form k 
acquisition of loegering mfg 
inc 
on october   asv closed on its acquisition of loegering mfg 
inc of casselton  north dakota in a merger transaction 
loegering is a manufacturer of over the tire steel tracks for wheeled skid steers and also provides attachments for the skid steer market 
asv acquired all the outstanding common stock of loegering for million through the issuance of approximately  shares of asv common stock valued at million and cash of million 
of the asv shares issued in the transaction   shares have been registered for resale on a form s registration statement which was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on march  following completion of the transaction  loegering became a wholly owned subsidiary of asv 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase 
in a related transaction  asv acquired real property representing loegering s manufacturing facility from loegering affiliates for million 
caterpillar revenue recognition gross profit the company recognizes as sales its cost for the mtl undercarriages  as defined in the commercial alliance agreement between the company and caterpillar  plus a portion of the anticipated gross profit that caterpillar expects to recognize upon sale of the mtls to caterpillar dealers  when the company ships undercarriages to caterpillar 
the gross profit percentage that we receive for two of the three undercarriages we currently sell to caterpillar was reduced by on january   with the overall gross profit percentage on the sale of all three undercarriages expected to exceed for the gross profit percentage that we expect to receive for the third undercarriage sold to caterpillar will also be reduced by effective january  both of these reductions would reduce the amount of gross profit we will recognize on the sale of these undercarriages to caterpillar if the level of net sales in and were to be the same as in customer note receivable included in accounts receivable at december  is a note receivable for approximately  from a customer 
the note bears interest at and is due in monthly installments beginning february as of february   the customer is current on all amounts owed the company under this note 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has guaranteed the repayment of a note made by a customer to a non affiliated finance company in payment of amounts owed to the company by this customer 
to determine the value of the financing guarantee  the lending institution provided us with the cost of the financing both with and without the guarantee 
this differential was used to determine the amount of the financing guarantee of  this amount was recorded as a reduction of net sales for the year ended december   when the note and guarantee were entered into 
a similar amount has been included in other accrued liabilities at december  and the balance of this note at february  was  as of february   the customer is current on all amounts owed the finance company under this note 
relationship with finance companies the company has affiliated itself with several finance companies that finance the sale of the company s products 
by using these finance companies  the company receives payment for its products shortly after their shipment 
the company pays a portion of the interest cost associated with financing these shipments that would normally be paid by the customer  over a period generally ranging from three to twelve months  depending on the amount of down payment made by the customer 
the company is also providing twelve month terms for one machine to be used for demonstration purposes for each qualifying dealer 
in addition  the company does  from time to time  offer extended term financing on the sale of certain products to its dealers for periods ranging from days to two years stock repurchase program in october  the company announced a stock buy back program whereby asv could repurchase up to million of its common stock in the open market 
this stock repurchase program expired in october and was not renewed 
under this program  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
under previous programs  the most recent of which expired in september  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
caterpillar equity transactions in january  the company sold  shares of its common stock to caterpillar at per share 
these shares were subject to an acceleration notice issued to caterpillar by the company in october in connection with the warrant held by caterpillar 
also in january  the company repurchased the remaining warrant held by caterpillar for a cash payment of million and the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock 
as of february   caterpillar owned of the company s outstanding common stock and no longer has any options  warrants or contractual rights pursuant to which they may acquire additional shares of the company s common stock 
new accounting pronouncements sfas revised share based payment 
this revision to statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires the fair value from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas revised establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees  except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
this statement is effective for the company beginning july  the company anticipates the effect of adopting this statement will reduce its diluted earnings per share figure by approximately 
for the six months ended december  for those share based payment transactions in existence as of december  sfas inventory costs 
this statement requires the accounting for idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material be recognized as current period charges 
this statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for the company beginning january  management does not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on the company 
cash requirements the company believes cash expected to be generated from operations and its existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will satisfy the company s projected working capital needs and other cash requirements for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
forward looking statements the statements set forth above under liquidity and capital resources and elsewhere in this form k regarding asv s future sales levels  product mix  profitability  expense levels and liquidity are forward looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions  and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
certain factors may affect whether these anticipated events occur including asv s ability to successfully manufacture the machines  unanticipated delays  costs or other difficulties in the development and manufacture of the machines  market acceptance of the machines  general market conditions  corporate developments at asv or caterpillar and asv s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its alliances with caterpillar 
any forward looking statements provided from time to time by the company represent only management s then best current estimate of future results or trends 
risk factors our revenue and business would be harmed if caterpillar ceased manufacturing and marketing products under our loader alliance agreement 
under the terms of the alliance agreement we entered into with caterpillar inc in october  we agreed with caterpillar to jointly develop and manufacture a five model line of caterpillar branded rubber tracked skid steer loaders called multi terrain loaders the alliance machines 
the term of the alliance agreement expires october  these new loaders utilize caterpillar s skid steer technology and our rubber track undercarriage technology 
all five models have been developed and are available to all caterpillar dealers 
the alliance machines are assembled in sanford  north carolina  at caterpillar s skid steer loader facility 
the undercarriages are manufactured at our facility in cohasset  minnesota 
the successful manufacturing and marketing of the alliance machines entail significant risks as described below the development and introduction of the alliance machines were scheduled on an aggressive time table and there exists the possibility this time table may not have detected all potential issues regarding the production or function of the machines 
for example  in  caterpillar experienced production issues which caused them to stop production of the alliance machines 
as a result  we did not ship undercarriages to caterpillar while the production issues were resolved  resulting in decreased revenue to us 
additional production or other issues may be experienced by caterpillar or us in the future  which could cause our sales of undercarriages to caterpillar to decrease or terminate while the issues are resolved 
the overall market for rubber track machines is relatively new and the benefits of rubber track machines are not currently widely known 
we and caterpillar believe the market potential for rubber track machines justifies the necessary investment in the alliance machines 
however  there is no assurance the alliance machines will attract sufficient demand to warrant their continued production and produce the returns anticipated by us and caterpillar 
we will be relying significantly on caterpillar for their continued interest in manufacturing and marketing the alliance machines 
in  total sales to caterpillar accounted for of our net sales 
if caterpillar stopped manufacturing the alliance machines  or stopped marketing the alliance machines to its dealers or caterpillar dealers did not adequately promote the sale of the alliance machines  our revenue would be decreased and our business would be harmed 
as part of the alliance agreement  we agreed not to manufacture machines that are similar to and would compete with the alliance machines 
also  we may not knowingly sell our undercarriages to any party who shall manufacture  or resell an undercarriage to a party who shall manufacture  a machine that substantially competes with the alliance machines 
we may  however  continue to manufacture our own models that do not substantially compete with the alliance machines 
the alliance agreement calls for us to receive a portion of the gross profit on the sale of the alliance machines to caterpillar dealers 
therefore  a portion of our future revenue will be dependent on the success of caterpillar in selling the alliance machines to caterpillar dealers 
in addition  the gross profit percentage that we receive for two of the three undercarriages we currently sell to caterpillar was reduced by on january   with the overall gross profit percentage on the sale of all three undercarriages expected to exceed for the gross profit percentage that we expect to receive for the third undercarriage sold to caterpillar will also be reduced by effective january  both of these reductions would reduce the amount of gross profit we will recognize on the sale of these undercarriages to caterpillar if the level of net sales in and were to be the same as in our business could be materially harmed if caterpillar did not actively support and cooperate with us to provide us with various commercial services 
as a result of our transactions with caterpillar  we may rely on commercial services provided by or through caterpillar for the operation of our business  including marketing  development  warranty and parts services 
as a result  to the extent we avail ourselves of these services  we may become dependent upon the cooperation of caterpillar for the operation of our business 
in connection with caterpillar s purchase of shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock in january  we entered into several agreements with caterpillar  including a commercial alliance agreement  a marketing agreement and a management services agreement 
these agreements contemplate that we would also enter into several additional agreements with caterpillar  including a trademark and trade dress license agreement  supply agreements  a services agreement  a technology license agreement and a joint venture agreement which agreements  together with the commercial alliance agreement  the marketing agreement and the management services agreement  we collectively refer to as the commercial agreements 
although caterpillar is obligated under the terms of the commercial agreements to provide various services to us  including marketing  development  warranty and parts services  the specific obligations of caterpillar under those agreements are not explicitly defined 
therefore  if caterpillar chose not to cooperate with us in providing these services  it may be impractical for us to require caterpillar to provide any such services to the extent necessary to be beneficial to us 
if caterpillar were to decide not to actively support and cooperate with us to provide us with these services  our business could be materially harmed 
caterpillar has the ability to influence or control us  which could negatively affect other shareholders and could discourage offers by third parties to acquire us 
caterpillar owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
accordingly  caterpillar has the ability to influence our business and operations to a certain extent 
in addition to its rights as a shareholder to influence us  caterpillar has the right to designate directors for election to the board of directors under the securities purchase agreement between us and caterpillar dated october   proportionate to its stock ownership interest  which increases caterpillar s ability to influence us 
currently  one of our nine directors has been designated by caterpillar  despite the fact that caterpillar would be entitled to designate two directors  assuming a board comprised of nine directors 
if caterpillar were to exercise its right to designate an additional director  based on its current stock ownership interest  we anticipate that  assuming there were no vacancies on our board  we would expand the size of our board and elect an additional director designated by caterpillar 
given the significant percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock owned by caterpillar  third parties also may be discouraged from making an offer to acquire control or ownership of us 
if caterpillar begins selling  or is perceived to be selling  its shares of our common stock  the market price of our common stock may fall 
caterpillar owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
under our agreements with caterpillar  caterpillar has agreed not to sell any shares of our common stock for so long as the alliance agreement  as it may be amended  modified or supplemented from time to time  remains in effect 
however  sales by caterpillar of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could take place  could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
if this happens  then stockholders may face difficulty in selling their shares and the price at which they sell their shares may be reduced 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
our management has had limited experience in managing companies experiencing growth like ours 
further growth and expansion of our business will place additional demands upon our current management and other resources 
we believes that future growth and success depends to a significant extent on our ability to be able to effectively manage our growth in several areas  including  but not limited to i production facility expansion construction  ii entrance to new geographic and use markets  iii international sales  service and production  and iv employee and management development 
no assurance can be given that our business will grow in the future and that we will be able to effectively manage such growth 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
a disruption or termination of our relationships with certain suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
certain of the components included in our products are obtained from a limited number of suppliers  including the rubber track component used on our products 
disruption or termination of supplier relationships could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained  if necessary  but the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of the components or the need to develop alternative sources  if and as required in the future  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which in turn may have an adverse effect on our operating results and customer relationships 
a number of our competitors have more resources and more established reputations than us 
if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
companies whose products compete in the same markets as the posi track have substantially more financial  production and other resources than us  as well as established reputations within the industry and more extensive dealer networks 
for  sales of posi track products accounted for approximately of our net sales 
also  the growth potential of the markets being pursued by us could attract more competitors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in the marketplace or that we will be able to establish a significantly dominant position in the marketplace before our potential competitors are able to develop similar products 
if our rubber track vehicles do not continue to receive market acceptance  our operating results will be harmed 
our success is dependent upon increasing market acceptance of rubber track vehicles in the markets in which our products compete 
most small to medium sized tractor type vehicles in competition with the posi track are wheeled vehicles and most track driven vehicles are designed for specific limited tasks 
the market for rubber track vehicles is relatively new and there can be no assurance that our products will gain sufficient market acceptance to enable us to sustain profitable operations 
if we are not able to manage and integrate the operations of loegering mfg 
inc  our operating results will be harmed 
in october  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of loegering mfg 
inc loegering of casselton  north dakota for a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
we have not previously been involved in an acquisition of this nature  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage and integrate the operations of loegering 
the process of integrating loegering may be a difficult and time consuming process 
in particular  the process of combining sales and marketing forces  consolidating administrative functions  and coordinating product offerings can take longer  cost more  and provide fewer benefits than initially anticipated 
management may face difficulties  delays and costs as it works to retain customers  to minimize the risk of loss or reduction of customer orders due to the potential for market confusion  hesitation and delay  to coordinate infrastructure operations in an effective and efficient manner and to combine certain operations and functions using common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resource practices 
to the extent any of these events occurs  the benefits of the transaction may be reduced  at least for a period of time 
our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully develop new products or if new products developed are unable to gain market acceptance 
we intend to increase our market penetration by developing and marketing new rubber tracked vehicles and other new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop the new products  or that any new products developed by us will gain market acceptance 
one of the expected benefits of the loegering acquisition is future sales of its proprietary versatile track system r vts  which we expect to account for a majority of net sales of loegering products in if we are unable to achieve our anticipated timing of introduction and sales of the vts product  or if adequate quantities of raw materials to meet the expected demand for this product in are not available  the benefits of the transaction may be reduced or delayed for a period of time 
our business may also be adversely affected if the vts product does not gain market acceptance as quickly as we anticipate or at all 
a cyclical  economic downturn in the construction and farm equipment industries could materially harm our business 
the construction and farm equipment industries  in which the posi track competes  have historically been cyclical 
sales of construction and agricultural equipment are generally affected by the level of activity in the construction and agricultural industries  including farm production and demand  weather conditions  interest rates and construction levels especially housing starts 
in addition  the demand for our products may be affected by the seasonal nature of the activities in which they are used and by overall economic conditions in general 
therefore  an economic downturn in the construction and farm equipment industries  which could result in part based upon seasonal factors  could materially harm our business 
the loss of the services of any key member of our management could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our objectives 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of certain key personnel  including our ceo  gary lemke 
we have key person life insurance on the life of mr 
lemke  but we do not have an employment agreement with mr 
lemke 
the loss of the services of any key member of our management could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our objectives 
we may face product liability claims  which could result in losses in excess of our insurance coverage or in our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future 
like most manufacturing companies  we may be subject to significant claims for product liability and may have difficulty in obtaining product liability insurance or be forced to pay high premiums 
we currently have product liability insurance and have not been subject to material claims for product liability 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance in the future or that our present or future insurance would prove adequate to cover potential product claims 
our business would be adversely affected if we are not able to protect our intellectual property rights or if we get involved in litigation relating to our intellectual property rights 
we currently hold four patents on certain aspects of the suspension and drive mechanisms used in certain of our products 
we have also filed additional patent applications
