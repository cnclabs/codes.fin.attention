our company our business is organized into two segments energy products and industrial products 
these segments are designed to improve the alignment of strategies and objectives among sales  marketing and production  provide for more timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses and focus long term planning efforts on key objectives and initiatives 
we conduct our business primarily through the following five operating units maverick tube  lp  our primary lp producer of energy and industrial products other than steel electrical conduit  prudential steel ltd  our canadian producer of energy and industrial products  acquired in  precision tube technology lp and seacat lp  our coiled tubing producers  acquired in and  respectively  texas arai  a division of maverick tube  lp  and our producer of api and premium couplings  acquired in  and republic conduit  a division of maverick c p  inc  our primary producer of steel electrical conduit  acquired in the following table sets forth information about the segments  products and facilities of each of our operating units location segment and products product sizes acreage building square footage maverick tube  lp hickman  ar energy octg and line pipe industrial hss  standard pipe and piling products conroe  tx energy octg and line pipe counce  tn energy octg and line pipe industrial rigid conduit and standard pipe prudential steel ltd

our energy products business the energy products industry manufacturers in the energy industry produce a wide variety of products used in the exploration  production and transmission of oil and natural gas 
we produce four principal classes of energy products octg  line pipe  coiled tubing  and couplings 
octg consists of drill pipe  production casing  surface casing and production tubing 
drill pipe is used and may be reused to drill wells 
production casing forms the structural liner in oil and natural gas wells to provide support and prevent collapse during drilling operations and is not removed after it has been installed in a well 
surface casing is used to protect water bearing formations during the drilling of a well 
production tubing is placed within the casing and is used to convey oil and natural gas to the surface and may be replaced many times during the life of a producing well 
manufacturers produce octg in numerous sizes  weights  grades and end finishes 
we believe most octg is produced to api and canadian standard association specifications 
the grade of pipe used in a particular application depends on technical requirements for strength  corrosion resistance and other performance qualities 
octg is generally classified into groupings of carbon and alloy grades 
carbon grades of octg have yield strength levels of  pounds per square inch or less and are generally used in oil and natural gas wells drilled to depths less than  feet 
alloy grades of octg have yield strength levels of  pounds per square inch or more and are generally used in oil and natural gas wells drilled to depths in excess of  feet or for high temperature wells  highly corrosive wells or other more critical applications 
manufacturers employ either an electric resistance welded or seamless process to produce octg 
electric resistance welded pipe  sometimes referred to as welded pipe  is produced by processing flat rolled steel into strips that are then cold formed into a cylindrical form and welded  heat treated or seam annealed 
seamless products are produced by individually heating and piercing solid steel billets into pipe 
both types of pipe are end finished with threads and couplings 
based on published industry statistics  electric resistance welded products account for approximately half of the tonnage of north american octg consumed annually 
we believe electric resistance welded products have captured a significant majority of the carbon grade octg market  while seamless products retain a majority of the alloy grade octg market 
we also believe further significant market penetration of welded products will depend upon increased market acceptance of welded products  particularly outside of north america 
line pipe products are used for surface production flow lines  gathering systems  pipeline transportation and distribution systems for oil  natural gas  and other fluids 
although line pipe is produced in both welded and seamless forms  welded product represents approximately of the north american line pipe consumed annually 
the abundance of natural gas drilling in and the federally mandated inspection of the  mile national pipeline network should cause demand to be strong in and beyond 
coiled pipe products consist of down hole tubing  line pipe  and umbilicals 
coiled down hole tubing is used as production tubing  particularly in shallow gas wells in canada and to service existing oil and natural gas wells by reestablishing well production and extending well life 
coiled line pipe is a relatively new technology used in subsea applications where continuous lengths of premium coated steel pipe are used as flow lines 
coiled line pipe is a low cost alternative in offshore applications as it allows for much more rapid installation 
coiled umbilicals form the piping system to actuate subsea wellheads and provide monitoring and other controls of these wellheads 
coiled tubing is manufactured in the same manner as octg with the exception of the end finishing process 
coiled tubing does not require the same end finishing as traditional octg products due to its continuous length 
the coiled tubing is then loaded onto reels and shipped to our customers 
couplings are made from seamless pipe and used to connect joints of octg products in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas 
our energy products we manufacture octg used for production tubing  production casing  and surface casing 
we do not manufacture drill pipe 
we also manufacture line pipe and coiled pipe 
in  we expanded our energy products line to include api and premium couplings by acquiring texas arai 
all of our products are produced using the electric resistance welded process  with the exception of a portion of the coiled tubing produced by seacat and our couplings produced by texas arai 
our energy products are designed to meet or exceed the applicable standards required by api and canadian standards association 
in addition  similar to other producers  we manufacture our octg products in custom or proprietary grades 
we design and engineer our custom and proprietary grades for similar applications as products meeting or exceeding api and canadian standards association standards and to provide performance features comparable to products meeting those standards 
we warrant our api and canadian standards association casing and tubing to be materially free of defects in material or workmanship in accordance with the applicable specifications 
in addition  we warrant our proprietary grade products to be materially free of defects in accordance with our published standards 
we have not incurred significant costs in connection with these warranties 
we manufacture finished goods in both carbon and alloy steel grades 
virtually all of our products are end finished at our facilities 
in contrast  some of our competitors outsource the end finishing of their products  thus adding to their freight and handling costs  or do not end finish their products at all 
the end finish process includes  as appropriate  upsetting  beveling  threading  pressure testing and the application of couplings 
our end finished octg products are ready to be installed in oil or natural gas wells 
by end finishing our products  we are better able to control quality  cost and service to our customers 
three of our us energy facilities provide heat treatment capabilities necessary for the production of alloy grade pipe 
our alloy grade tubing and casing products accounted for approximately  and of the tons of octg products we sold in  and  respectively 
carbon grade tubing and casing accounted for the balance of these tons 
marketing we sell octg and line pipe throughout north america using multiple sales channels including distributors and directly to endusers 
distributors resell our product to endusers who are major and independent oil and natural gas production  gathering and pipeline companies 
we sell coiled pipe typically to oilfield service companies throughout the world and sell premium couplings directly to north american manufacturers  processors  and distributors of octg products 
our marketing philosophy emphasizes delivering competitively priced  quality products while providing a high level of service to our customers 
we market ourselves as a broad line supplier of octg  line pipe  coiled pipe and premium coupling products 
we maintain finished goods inventories at our production facilities and at outside yard locations near prime drilling areas 
this allows for prompt delivery of our products 
manufacturing in order to control our manufacturing costs  we attempt to maximize production yields from purchased steel and reduce unit labor costs 
during  and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on new capital equipment for our existing energy facilities 
in  we used million for an upgrade of an existing mill at prudential steel and million on various smaller projects throughout our energy facilities 
in  we used million for the installation of a new slitter in arkansas 
in  we used million for the installation of equipment relocated from our longview  washington  facility to our large diameter pipe and tubing facility in hickman  arkansas  and million for the installation of the longview slitter in our calgary  alberta facility 
our capital budget for our energy facilities for is million 
we expect these capital expenditures to result in manufacturing cost savings  quality improvements  expansion and maintenance of our production capabilities and product lines 
included in the capital budget for our energy facilities is a million expansion of our precision coiled tubing facility 
we control labor costs by automating certain activities and by seeking to optimize product throughput and scheduling 
generally  we maintain an innovative compensation plan  whereby the employees of our facilities who achieve certain performance based criteria receive gain sharing quarterly bonuses 
in addition  some employees are eligible to receive annual profitability bonuses 
the annual capacity at our energy facilities is approximately million tons 
we operated our energy facilities at a capacity utilization of approximately and during and  respectively 
seasonality seasonal fluctuations impact our customers and the demand for our products to some extent 
for instance  weather conditions during the first half of the year make drilling more difficult in the us  while the second and third quarters are more difficult in western canada 
consequently  drilling activity and the corresponding demand for our products are lower at these times in these respective regions 
competition the suppliers of octg and line pipe products face a highly competitive market 
we understand the principal competitive factors affecting our business to be price  quality  delivery  availability and service 
we believe we enjoy an excellent reputation for quality products  availability and outstanding customer service 
we compete with several north american and numerous foreign producers of octg  some of which have greater financial resources than we do 
in the north american octg market during  our more significant competitors were lone star steel  a subsidiary of lone star technologies  inc  newport steel company  a subsidiary of ns group and ipsco inc  each of which primarily produce electric resistance welded pipe  and us steel corporation  and v m star  a subsidiary of vallourec mannesmann tubes  each of which primarily produce seamless pipe 
we also compete in the line pipe market with these same companies and with foreign producers of line pipe  most of which are affiliates of large foreign steel producers 
our most significant coiled tubing competitors during were quality tubing  inc  a subsidiary of varco international  inc 
and gibson tube 
in the coupling market during  our more significant competitors were wheeling machine products  a subsidiary of lone star technologies  inc  lincoln manufacturing  inc 
and amtex machine products  inc 
during  and  we estimate us octg tons consumed by imports was  and  respectively 
during  and  we estimate canadian octg tons consumed by imports was  and  respectively 
our share of these canadian imports was  and  respectively 
our industrial products business the industrial products industry industrial products encompass a wide variety of tubing and pipe products used for a number of applications 
we manufacture steel electrical conduit  hollow structural sections  or hss  standard pipe  pipe piling and mechanical tubing products 
steel electrical conduit is primarily used as sheathing for electrical and communications wiring in industrial  commercial  and institutional construction referred to as nonresidential construction 
our hss products are primarily used for construction  transportation  agricultural  material handling and recreational applications 
standard pipe products are used in industrial applications such as steam  water  air  plumbing and heating 
pipe piling products are used in construction to stabilize groundwork and foundations 
mechanical tubing products are used for a variety of original equipment manufacturing needs such as axles  furniture  scaffolding and sports equipment 
like octg  steel electrical conduit  hss  standard pipe  pipe piling  and mechanical tubing products are produced by processing flat rolled steel into strips  which are cold formed and then welded 
the machinery and equipment used to manufacture our industrial products are similar to that used to manufacture our energy products 
our industrial products are not  however  subject to the same degree of testing and inspection as our energy products  therefore  these products cost less to manufacture 
in addition  these products do not require end finishing  further reducing the production costs of our industrial products as compared to our energy products 
our industrial products we produce steel electrical conduit  hss  standard pipe  pipe piling  and mechanical tubing at our facilities in sizes ranging from to square  rectangular and round tubing 
our products range from to inch in thickness 
marketing hss  standard pipe  pipe piling  and mechanical tubing markets are typically regional  primarily because order sizes are smaller and lead time requirements are shorter than for octg 
we sell to distributors  contractors and  to a lesser extent  endusers primarily through both company sales personnel and experienced manufacturing representatives 
our marketing strategy emphasizes delivering competitively priced  quality products while providing a high level of service to our customers 
the annual capacity at our steel electrical conduit  hss  standard pipe  pipe piling and mechanical tubing products facilities is approximately million tons 
during and  our industrial product group operated at a combined capacity of and  respectively 
seasonality seasonal fluctuations also impact the demand for our industrial products to some extent 
as demand is driven by nonresidential construction  the fourth quarter is typically a quarter of weaker demand 
manufacturing during  and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on additional equipment at our industrial facilities  excluding million in for deposits relating to the new conduit facility 
our capital budget for our industrial facilities is million 
we have also committed million on the construction of the new conduit facility 
by consolidating our steel electrical conduit business into one location  we expect to eliminate our current outsourcing needs  which should decrease our manufacturing costs and improve our efficiency 
in addition  we have chosen a location that is close to steel sources and on the inland waterway  which should result in lower inbound freight costs  centrally located  which should reduce outbound freight costs  and in an area of the country with cost effective labor 
competition we believe the principal competitive factors affecting our steel electrical conduit  hss  standard pipe  pipe piling and mechanical tube businesses are price  product availability  delivery and service 
during  our primary steel electrical conduit competitors were allied tube conduit  a division of tyco international  wheatland tube company  a john maneely company  and western tube conduit corporation 
the broad distribution network and service component of this business creates a significant barrier for entrance into this market 
our products also compete with pvc conduit  cable tray  and flexible metallic conduit which we do not manufacture 
these products can be substituted for the types of products we manufacture in certain situations  thereby impacting our market share 
the hss competitive market varies from that of steel electrical conduit 
we compete primarily against several north american and numerous producers of structural tubing from the rest of the world 
foreign competitors  primarily from canada  represented  and of total us sales of structural tubing in  and  respectively 
during  our more significant north american structural tube competitors were bull moose tube company  a subsidiary of the caparo group  hanna steel corporation  atlas tube inc  independence tube corporation  leavitt tube company  llc  ipsco inc  southland tube  inc 
and copperweld corporation 
a significant market for standard pipe exists  however  we have chosen to reduce our sales in this market to focus on more profitable product lines 
we compete with competitors from around the world 
foreign competition represented approximately  and of total domestic sales of standard pipe in  and  respectively 
during  our more significant domestic standard pipe competitors were wheatland tube company  united states steel corporation and ipsco inc raw materials given steel comprises sixty percent of our production costs  in order to gain economies of scale with respect to pricing  quality  availability and delivery  we maintain  negotiate and execute our steel purchase agreements at the corporate level 
during  we consumed approximately of all hot rolled steel produced in north america and as such  we believe we were the largest purchaser of hot rolled steel in this region 
during  of our steel for our operations was purchased from nucor corporation and international steel group 
we have aimed to strategically locate our facilities near steel sources to reduce transportation costs and working capital requirements 
for example  our hickman  arkansas facility is located adjacent to a nucor facility  which allows us to transport via rail at reduced expense 
further  its location near the river provides another transportation option in sourcing raw materials 
to date  we have not experienced any significant disruption in our supply of raw materials 
employees at december   we employed  people 
the majority of our employees are not represented by a union 
however  five locations operate under collective bargaining agreements with  or have employees who are members of  the united steelworkers of america 
prudential steel ltd  located in calgary  alberta  operates under a collective bargaining agreement that covers approximately of its employees 
the agreement is due to expire on december  the elyria and ferndale facilities of republic conduit also operate under collective bargaining agreements that in the aggregate cover of the employees of maverick c p  inc the agreements are due to expire on november  in addition  our counce  tennessee facility of maverick tube  lp  operates under a collective bargaining agreement that covers approximately of the employees at that location 
the agreement is also due to expire on november  furthermore  approximately of the employees of texas arai  a division of maverick tube  lp  are union members  however  the union at texas arai was decertified on january  in total  considering both counce and texas arai locations  as of december   approximately of the employees of maverick tube  lp are affiliated with a union 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k when evaluating our business and financial condition 
additional risks not presently known to us and risks that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
a material decline in oil and natural gas prices should reduce demand for our energy products  which would cause our sales to decrease 
our principal products consist of octg  line pipe  coiled tubing and couplings 
sales of these products to the energy industry constitute our most significant revenue source 
demand for these products depends primarily on the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled  completed and worked over in north america and the depth and drilling conditions of these wells 
the level of these activities is primarily dependent on current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices 
many factors  such as the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  general economic conditions  global weather patterns  and global conflicts  affect these prices 
as a result  future levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices are uncertain 
in periods where the demand level for our energy products is reduced  we would expect our sales of these products to decrease 
the level of imports of octg into north america  which has varied significantly over time  affects the north american octg market 
we believe import levels of octg are affected by north american and overall world demand for octg and the relative value of the us and canadian dollars 
the likely result of significant increases in imports would be decreased sales of our energy products and our overall profitability 
increases in steel prices  which would increase the costs of manufacturing our products  could likely decrease our operating profits 
steel represents approximately sixty percent of our cost of goods sold 
as a result  the steel industry affects our business both positively and negatively 
numerous factors  most of which are beyond our control  drive the cycles of the steel industry and influence steel prices 
some of these factors are general economic conditions  industry capacity utilization  import duties  and other trade restrictions and currency exchange rates 
if steel prices increase and we are unable to increase our selling prices by a similar amount  our operating profit would decrease 
we depend on a few suppliers for a significant portion of our steel  and the loss of one or more significant suppliers could adversely affect our ability to obtain our most important raw material 
historically  we have purchased a significant portion of our steel from a small number of suppliers 
the loss of any of these suppliers or interruption of production at one or more of the suppliers could adversely affect our ability to obtain our most important raw material 
in such a case  our cost of purchasing steel from alternate sources could be higher and could temporarily affect our ability to produce sufficient quantities of our products necessary to sustain our market share  thus impacting our results of operations 
reductions in base industry inventory levels could reduce our sales and profit 
industry inventory levels of our products  particularly octg  can change significantly from period to period 
these changes can have a direct adverse effect on the demand for new production of energy and industrial products when customers draw from inventory rather than purchase new products 
reduced demand  in turn  would likely result in reduced sales volume and overall profitability 
our plans to consolidate our conduit operations into one facility may not be successful 
we are in the process of consolidating our conduit operations into a state of the art facility to be located in louisville  kentucky 
in connection with the consolidation  we expect to spend approximately million  which will include the purchase of land  building  new equipment and upgrades to existing equipment to improve the efficiency and productivity of our conduit manufacturing operations 
the consolidation of our conduit operations may expose us to certain risks such as severance and plant abandonment costs  potential unforeseen or higher than expected costs  and risk associated with operating difficulties 
any of these risks could adversely affect or prevent the success of our efforts to consolidate our conduit operations 
if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner  our growth strategy could be adversely impacted 
an important element of our growth strategy has been and continues to be the acquisitions of other businesses that either expand or complement our existing product lines 
integrating businesses  however  involves a number of special risks  including the possibility management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations  unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems  problems relating to assimilating and retaining the employees of the acquired business  accounting issues that arise in connection with the acquisition  challenges in retaining customers  and potential adverse short term effects on operating results 
in addition  we may incur debt to finance future acquisitions and issue securities in connection with future acquisitions that may dilute the holdings of our current or future stockholders 
if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner  our growth strategy could be adversely impacted 
the operations of the endusers of our products expose us to potential product liability claims 
drilling for and the transmission of oil and natural gas involve a variety of risks  including risks relating to failures  leaks and fires 
actual or claimed defects in our products could give rise to claims  liabilities  costs and expenses  including but not limited to loss of life  personal injury  property damage  damage to equipment and facilities  pollution  and loss of production or suspension of operations 
product liability claims occur infrequently in our business  but when they happen  they can be material 
we maintain insurance coverage against potential product liability claims  other than pollution  with a deductible of million per occurrence and a total claim limit of million per year 
however  in the future we may incur product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are subject to substantial deductibles or results in uninsured product liability costs 
these liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  result of operations and financial condition 
moreover  any claims made under our policies will likely cause our premiums to increase  and we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage levels in the future 
our level of indebtedness could make us vulnerable to down turns in the energy market 
because our energy business is highly cyclical  our historical financial results have been  and our future financial results are expected to be  subject to fluctuations 
while management believes our current level of indebtedness is reasonable relative to our current capitalization and working capital positions  our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to cyclical declines in the energy markets 
more specifically  our level of indebtedness could affect our operations and expose us to greater risks during a cyclical decline in several ways  including  but not limited to a greater percentage of our cash flow would be required to be used to service our indebtedness  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to meet our debt service and other fixed charge requirements  we may not be able to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate and other purposes  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our businesses and the industries in which we compete may be limited  and we may be put at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to our competitors that have relatively less indebtedness 
covenant restrictions in our senior revolving credit facility could limit our ability to operate our business 
our senior revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that prohibit or impose limitations subject to certain exceptions on us  with respect to  among other things the creation or incurrence of additional indebtedness  the creation or incurrence of liens  investments  mergers  acquisitions or changes of existence  ownership or business operations  the sale or other disposition of assets other than inventory in the ordinary course of business  the declaration or payment of dividends or the purchase  redemption  retirement or other acquisition of capital stock  transactions with affiliates  capital expenditures in excess of million in any calendar year  and granting of any negative pledge in any agreement  contract or understanding with a third party 
any one of these covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
moreover  our failure to comply with the financial and other covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  would prevent us from borrowing under our senior revolving credit facility and could require us to repay our borrowings before their due date 
if we were unable to make this repayment or otherwise refinance these borrowings  our lenders could foreclose on our assets 
because of the amount of business we conduct in canada  decreases in the value of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar reduce the profitability of our canadian operations 
although our financial results are reported in us dollars  a portion of our sales and operating costs is denominated in canadian dollars 
consequently  in consolidating the financial results of our canadian operations for reporting purposes  we are exposed to cash flow and earnings volatility as a result of fluctuations in relative currency values 
a significant decrease in the relevant value of the canadian dollar would reduce the profitability of our canadian operations  which would adversely affect the results of our consolidated operations 
our industry is characterized by intense competition 
we compete against a number of companies in each of our principal business lines 
some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and marketing resources and business diversification 
these companies may be better able than us to successfully endure down turns in either the energy or industrial products sector 
the structural  steel electrical conduit and portions of our energy products markets are largely commodity based in nature  and as a result  price competition is of particular importance 
in periods of reduced demand for our products  we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing our selling prices to meet competition or maintain selling prices which likely would sacrifice market share 
sales and overall profitability would be reduced under either scenario 
compliance with and changes in environmental  health and safety laws regulating the operation of our business could increase the costs of producing our product and expose us to environmental claims 
our businesses are subject to numerous us and canadian local  state  provincial and federal laws and regulations concerning environmental  health and safety matters  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharges and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes 
violations of such laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and penalties 
also  there are costs associated with compliance with these laws and regulations and risks of additional costs and liabilities relating to the investigation and remediation of past or present contamination  at current as well as former properties utilized by us and at third party disposal sites  regardless of fault or the legality of the original activities that led to such contamination 
moreover  future developments  such as changes in laws and regulations  more stringent enforcement or interpretation thereof and claims for property damage or personal injury could cause us to incur substantial losses or expenditures 
although we believe we are materially compliant with all applicable current laws and regulations  any new or modified laws or regulations could increase the cost of producing our products  thereby reducing our profits 
certain of our operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements that could subject us to additional labor costs 
three of our subsidiaries operate under collective bargaining agreements with the united steelworkers of america 
the agreements cover approximately of our total workforce 
three of these agreements expire in and one expires in our failure to renew or negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with substantially similar terms could result in labor disruptions and increased labor costs  thereby increasing the costs of producing our products 
we have defined benefit pensions plans  which could result in charges against our earnings 
our subsidiary  prudential steel ltd  sponsors two pension plans and a postretirement benefit plan for substantially all of its canadian employees and a supplemental executive retirement plan for certain former key prudential executives 
at december   certain of these plans were underfunded in the aggregate by approximately million 
in addition  if these plans fail to achieve an investment return equal to the estimated rate for a particular fiscal year  such deficiency could result in a charge against earnings for that and subsequent years 
effective internal controls over financial reporting provide only a reasonable assurance as to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to prevent fraud 
however  because of the inherent limitations with any system of controls  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls  or fraud  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
therefore  even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
moreover  projections of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in condition or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our controls  fail to implement new or improved controls  or if we experience difficulties in implementing these controls  our business and operating results could be affected  we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price 
item properties operating properties we own and operate manufacturing facilities located in the us and canada and lease one building at our hickman  arkansas  facility

critical accounting estimates a description of accounting estimates that require critical judgments and estimates 
our business we believe there are certain key drivers and industry factors that are critical to understanding our business 
for instance  the general driver of demand for our energy products is the level of enduser exploration  drilling  development and production of oil and natural gas 
the general driver of demand for our industrial products is the general level of economic activity in north america 
for both our energy and industrial products  the cost of steel is one of the primary factors that can affect our profitability in any given year 
in order to gain a deeper understanding of our business  however  we are providing an analysis of drivers and factors that are directly linked to the primary products we produce 
demand related drivers and factors octg we manufacture production casing  surface casing  and production tubing 
these octg products are used in new oil and natural gas wells 
accordingly  the primary driver for our octg business is the level of oil and natural gas drilling activity in north america 
the indicator we use to measure drilling activity is the number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs that are active  commonly known as rig count  prepared by baker hughes incorporated 
we believe the baker hughes rig count is widely accepted within the energy industry as a reliable indicator of drilling activity levels 
the level of drilling activity is largely a function of current prices for oil and natural gas and the industry s future price expectations 
changes in prices drive the amount of resources our endusers commit to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas 
accordingly  increases and decreases in prices have a direct effect on the demand for our octg products 
the amount of imports from foreign competitors also significantly affects the north american octg market 
high levels of imports reduce the volume sold by north american producers and tend to suppress selling prices 
we believe import levels of octg are affected by north american and overall world demand for octg and the relative value of the us and canadian dollars 
another item which reflects demand for our energy products in the us is inventory levels maintained by manufacturers  distributors and endusers and whether these inventory levels are being increased  reduced  or maintained 
inventory levels in canada are less meaningful because canadian endusers and distributors do not generally hold significant amounts of inventory 
the following table illustrates these demand related drivers and factors for the last three years year ended december  us market activity average rig count average us energy prices oil per barrel west texas intermediate natural gas per mcf us octg consumption in thousands of tons us producer shipments imports inventory increase decrease used pipe total us consumption canadian market activity average rig count average canadian energy prices natural gas per us per mcf canadian octg consumption in thousands of tons canadian producer shipments imports inventory increase decrease total canadian consumption the us rig count in the table is based on weekly rig count reporting from baker hughes  incorporated 
energy prices in the table are monthly average period prices as reported by spears and associates for west texas intermediate grade crude oil and the average us monthly natural gas cash price as reported by natural gas week 
imports are as reported by duane murphy and associates in the octg situation report 
inventory increase decrease is our estimate based upon independent research by duane murphy and associates 
used pipe quantities are calculated by multiplying recoverable tubing and casing tons by the number of abandoned oil and natural gas wells 
us consumption of octg is our estimate based on estimated per rig consumption of octg multiplied by the baker hughes rig count 
us producer shipments are our estimates calculated based on the components listed above 
the canadian rig count in the table is based on weekly rig count reporting from baker hughes  incorporated 
energy prices in the table are the average alberta natural gas spot price as reported by nickles energy group 
imports are as reported by statistics canada 
inventory increase decrease is our estimate based upon data reported by statistics canada 
canadian producer shipments are reported by statistics canada steel pipe and tube report 
oil and natural gas prices were higher on average throughout compared to and as higher energy demand  relatively low supply  and geopolitical instability maintained upward pressure on pricing 
these factors prompted an increase in north american drilling during compared to and as a result  we experienced additional demand for our products in compared to and we expect demand for our energy products to continue to remain strong throughout as both oil and natural gas prices are expected to sustain the number of active drilling rigs 
line pipe line pipe is used to transport the oil and natural gas from the wellsite to the refining or storage facilities 
accordingly  as with octg  drilling activity is a key driver of our line pipe business 
however  because line pipe is used later in the energy cycle  the impact to our line pipe business lags to months behind drilling activity changes 
similar to octg  we analyze the demand for our line pipe products by focusing on the baker hughes rig count  the impact of changes in the price of oil and natural gas  the effect of imports  and industry inventory levels 
in addition to the octg drivers and factors  our line pipe sales are also influenced by the level of pipe line construction activity  line pipe replacement requirements  new residential construction and utility purchasing programs 
as we mention in our octg discussion  the north american rig count increased as prices for oil and natural gas increased from to as a result  in analyzing the baker hughes rig count  it appears that us and canadian demand for line pipe under increased during by an estimated and  respectively  from for us sales  domestic shipments increased by in even though market share of domestic sales decreased by to due to aggressive import activity 
for canadian sales  domestic shipments decreased by in primarily because of a large seamless line pipe project that used product from argentina and mexico  which resulted in a decrease of in market share of domestic sales to 
coiled tubing and coiled line pipe coiled tubing is used down hole as production tubing and to workover wells  which means to service existing oil and natural gas wells by reestablishing well production and extending well life 
accordingly  the primary driver for our coiled tubing business is the number of wells being worked over 
we believe the baker hughes workover rig count is a reliable indicator for this type of activity 
the factors that impact the baker hughes workover rig count are similar to those that affect the rig count that drives octg 
north american workover rigs averaged  in  a increase compared to coiled line pipe is used in subsea flow line applications where the use of continuous reels of our premium coated steel line pipe reduces both mobilization and installation costs 
demand for this product has been further enhanced by the role liquefied natural gas is expected to play in natural gas supply in the future 
umbilical tubing is used in subsea control systems that connect the wellhead on the sea floor with surface production installations 
the primary driver of coiled line pipe demand and umbilical tubing demand is offshore spending  both in the gulf of mexico and international offshore drilling 
in  us offshore drilling spending decreased to billion from  while international spending was up to billion 
according to spears and associates  global offshore spending for is forecast to reach billion  an increase of over couplings we manufacture couplings in both carbon and alloy steel grades and we have the capabilities to provide a full range of api couplings from to in nominal sizes 
our api couplings are manufactured  inspected and tested to ensure that they meet or exceed api specifications 
we also manufacture a full range of premium couplings through various licensing agreements 
premium couplings are made to customer specification and offer superior performance for a wide range of complex applications 
industrial products our industrial products are used in numerous applications 
consequently  the sources of demand for these products are diverse 
however  we believe the primary demand driver for our industrial products is the general level of economic activity in the construction  transportation  agricultural  material handling and recreational market segments 
our significant industrial product types are steel electrical conduit  hollow structural sections  or hss  standard pipe  pipe piling and mechanical tubing 
steel electrical conduit the primary application for steel electrical conduit is sheathing for electrical and communications wiring in industrial  commercial and institutional construction  which is classified in general as nonresidential construction 
as such  steel electrical conduit demand is primarily influenced by changes in spending on nonresidential construction 
estimated domestic consumption of steel electrical conduit during  and was million  million and million tons  respectively 
we estimate that us demand for steel electrical conduit of the types we produce decreased seasonally by approximately during the fourth quarter of as compared to the prior year period as previously built inventory levels declined 
published forecasts for us nonresidential construction activity in predict a increase in construction starts  compared to a modest increase of experienced in we are one of four producers that account for most of the steel electrical conduit consumed in the us we estimate our domestic market share increased from to  due to our ability to produce product in a tight steel market during the second quarter of hss we estimate domestic consumption of hss during  and was million  million and million tons  respectively 
in addition  we estimate the us demand for hss of the type we produce increased by in as compared to  and total us producer shipments increased by  although imports captured more market share  bringing the import market share to 
we estimate our domestic market share decreased from to 
we believe this is due to our focus on increasing our selling prices throughout the year 
in  the canadian international trade tribunal ruled that imports from the republic of south korea  the republic of turkey  and the republic of south africa were dumped in canada at significant margins 
as a result  imports from these countries are subject to an administrative process of determining normal values or import prices are advanced by a duty 
these administrative procedures will apply to all imports of hss from these countries through august standard pipe standard pipe is primarily used in construction applications for transporting gases and fluids 
the most significant drivers of demand for standard pipe are general economic activity and nonresidential construction expenditures 
we estimate domestic consumption of standard pipe during  and was million  million and million tons  respectively 
according to published reports and management estimates  preliminary numbers indicate us standard pipe demand for increased over by 
while domestic shipments increased  the import market share increased to in from in selling prices of our products our average annual selling price for octg  line pipe  steel electrical conduit  hss and standard pipe in increased by    and over the average selling price in  respectively 
similarly  our average selling price for our canadian energy products and industrial products from to increased by and  respectively 
our canadian pricing in was further impacted by a increase in the exchange rate 
these selling price increases were driven by additional demand for our products and steel price increases 
steel costs of our products the steel component of our costs of goods sold represents approximately sixty percent of our total costs of good sold 
accordingly  we believe another key driver of our profitability is the cost of steel and our ability to pass that cost onto our customers 
the following table illustrates the price of steel over the last six years 
mavktable 
jpg 
the significant increase in our cost of steel experienced in resulted primarily from steel suppliers imposing unprecedented scrap surcharges upon us based upon the american metal market s consumer buying price for no 
busheling 
the amount of the surcharge fluctuated monthly throughout and reached an all time high in september at per ton 
because we value our inventory using an average cost methodology  our steel component of our cost of goods sold lags steel price changes by approximately to months 
therefore  our average steel component of cost of goods sold reached per ton for which represents an increase of over the average cost of steel per ton in our replacement cost of steel peaked in november at higher than the average cost of goods sold for these higher replacement costs will flow into cost of goods sold during the first and second quarters of we believe the cost of steel is trending downward  and as such  we expect our first quarter replacement cost of steel to be equal to our fourth quarter cost of goods sold which was approximately higher than the average cost of steel per ton in as a result of these steel cost changes and our ability to raise our selling prices throughout  we experienced high profit margins during the first three quarters of by fourth quarter  our profit margins were reduced as the higher cost of steel flowed into cost of goods sold and partially offset the selling price changes described above 
our business strategy we have developed a business strategy that is focused on the following strategic initiatives generate profitable organic and strategic growth we are committed to being a growth company 
since  our net sales and earnings per share have grown at a compound annual growth rates of and  respectively 
our growth has positioned us  we believe  as the north american market share leader in oilfield tubing and casing  coiled tubing  line pipe  coiled line pipe  couplings  and other custom engineered pipe products used in oil and natural gas exploration  production  and transmission 
in  we completed the acquisition of texas arai  the north american market share leader in api and premium couplings 
our million investment to consolidate our republic conduit facilities in louisville  kentucky to be completed in early represents our commitment to organic growth in in addition  we are investing approximately million to increase the manufacturing capacity of precision tube  our coiled tubing business  by 
this facility is operating near capacity and  based on anticipated demand  this expansion will allow us to continue to grow net sales and increase market share 
expand geographic reach and portfolio of value added oil service products with our strong financial position  broadening our geographic reach and adding complementary products to our portfolio is a major focus 
we continually seek opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions as we did with the expansion into coiled tubing and subsea umbilicals in and  respectively 
while the nature and timing of such activities cannot be predicted  we are confident in our ability to continue to identify  acquire and assimilate attractive investment opportunities that satisfy our return on investment criteria 
achieve the best safety record in the oil service industry the company has made solid strides in our safety performance 
by implementing training programs  engineering safer work stations and rewarding safe practices  we have reduced our safety index by in and another in effects by all employees  at all levels  have been critical to produce these spectacular improvements 
generate superior returns on capital employed in all business units the ultimate measure of our success is  of course  the creation of shareholder value 
we remain committed to generating superior returns on capital employed in each of our business units 
in early  we restructured the company along business unit lines to provide a management structure conducive to future growth  as well as allowing us to better focus our attention and energies on our increasingly diverse products and constituencies 
further  it provides the mechanism to monitor return on net assets to ascertain which business units continue to provide shareholder value 
results of operations we experienced strong market conditions in that drove our overall operations 
we also aggressively priced most of our products based upon market demand and to absorb the unusually high steel costs we incurred throughout because a significant portion of the products we sold at the higher prices were made using lower cost steel  we achieved record levels of gross profit and net income in the following table illustrates the operating results and tons shipped for the periods presented in millions  except per share data and tons shipped vs

we increased our prices based upon additional product demand and to offset increases in the cost of steel implemented by our major steel suppliers 
because of our aggressive price increases  we experienced a decrease in total product shipments  from  tons for to  tons for cost of goods sold of  million increased million  or  compared to overall average unit cost per ton of products sold increased in over the prior year  from an average of per ton to per ton

we earned gross profit of million during  compared to million in gross profit per ton for was per ton as compared to per ton for gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for  as compared to for gross profit per ton increased primarily due to strengthening market conditions in both our energy and industrial products lines and the sale of generally lower cost inventory at higher selling prices during the first three quarters of we began to experience the impact of the higher cost of steel during the fourth quarter of  and we expect these higher costs to be expensed during the first and second quarters of as a result  we expect our gross profit margins to decrease in from the historic highs experienced in selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during from million during the increase resulted primarily from additional commission expense on our industrial product line  additional reserves in our allowance for doubtful accounts  incentive compensation  write downs on our joint venture and variable interest entity investments and charges related to business development activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in were compared to for the prior year 
the decrease resulted primarily from the increase in net sales 
the company recognized million in income during as recoupment of lost profits related to trade cases outstanding with the department of commerce 
payments went to various companies  including ours  under the continued dumping subsidy offset act of  commonly referred to as cdsoa  and were made to cover certain expenses including investment in manufacturing facilities and acquisition of technology incurred after the imposition of antidumping and anti subsidy measures 
we cannot predict the amounts or the certainty of any future recoveries associated with this act 
because these expenses were included in operating income in previous years  we recorded the recovery as a separate line item included in operating income to consistently reflect the effect of this payment on operations 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million for this increase was due to higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates during as compared to the prior year 
the provision for income taxes on continuing operations was million for  compared to the prior year provision of million

liquidity and capital resources general we operate in a capital intensive business and access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength 
in the past  we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive 
we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future  because we exhibit certain characteristics we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives 
these characteristics include the essential nature of the services we provide  our large and diverse customer base  our liquidity profile  our asset base  and our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation 
we continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows  our liquidity  and our capital resources  enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities 
in addition to our working capital needs  we have committed cash requirements for the construction and expansion of our operating facilities 
consistent with our business strategy  we currently intend to retain earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the near future 
any payment of cash dividends in the future will depend upon our financial condition  capital requirements  and earnings as well as other factors we may deem relevant 
in addition  our long term revolving credit facility with commercial lenders restricts the amount of dividends we can pay to our stockholders 
debt we have a senior credit facility providing for up to million of revolving credit 
the amount we can borrow is based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and property  plant and equipment reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had an outstanding balance of million and outstanding letters of credit under this agreement of million 
interest is payable monthly at the libor rate adjusted by an interest margin  depending upon certain financial measurements 
the additional available borrowing under the senior credit facility was approximately million as of december  the senior credit facility includes a financial covenant relating to maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio if availability falls below million 
also  the senior credit facility is structured to give our senior lenders dominion over our cash if availability falls below million 
if this occurs  the full amount outstanding would be classified as a current liability 
the senior credit facility also limits capital expenditures to million per year excluding the new republic conduit facility in louisville  kentucky and limits our ability to pay dividends  create liens  sell assets or enter into transactions with affiliates without the consent of the lenders 
we have million outstanding of convertible notes due june  the company pays interest semiannually on the convertible notes at the rate of per annum 
beginning with the six month interest period commencing on june   the company will pay contingent interest during a six month interest period if the average trading price of the convertible notes equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the convertible notes during a specified period prior to such six month interest period 
the convertible notes are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated to our senior indebtedness referred to above 
our net debt to capitalization ratio the sum of our current and long term debt  net of cash and cash equivalents compared to the sum of our stockholders equity and our current and long term debt  net of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased from at december   to at december  this ratio is a measure of our long term liquidity and is an indicator of financial flexibility 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that fixes the libor based variable rate in our senior credit facility at before the applicable margin 
the swap is being accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
accordingly  the difference between the interest received and interest paid is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense 
at december   the swap agreement is reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in other long term assets at its fair value of  the unrealized gain on the fair value of the swap agreement is reflected  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
the swap agreement terminates on march   and will not be renewed due to the minimal amount of debt we expect to have outstanding 
we have entered into a foreign currency hedge agreement with a notional amount of million that fixed the purchase of us dollars on january   at an exchange rate of 
prudential steel currently borrows funds denominated in us dollars 
this hedge agreement is designed to protect the variability of foreign currency risk when the debt matures 
the settlement date for the hedge agreement was january  the hedge agreement was accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
accordingly  the difference between the spot rate at the inception of the contract and the forward rate was reflected as an adjustment to interest expense during the duration of the contract 
at december   the hedge agreement was reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in other accrued liabilities at its fair value of million 
the unrealized loss on the fair value of the hedge agreement is reflected  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
summary of cash flow activity the following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended december for each respective period in thousands net cash provided by continuing operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by continuing operating activities during  cash generated from operations was negatively impacted primarily by a million increase in inventories 
as tons of inventory increased by only  the remaining increase is directly attributable to the increase in steel prices we experienced in compared to during  cash generated from operations was negatively impacted by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million decrease in accrued expenses and liabilities 
during  cash generated from continuing operations was positively impacted by an increase in accounts payable in the amount of million  offset by a decrease in inventories in the amount of million and a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the amount of million 
net cash used by investing activities the primary purpose for the net cash used by investing activities during was the net purchase of million in short term investments  cash used in the acquisition of texas arai in the amount of million and capital expenditures in the amount of million 
the primary purpose for the net cash used by investing activities during was the cash used in the acquisition of seacat in the amount of million and capital expenditures in the amount of million 
the primary purpose for the net cash used by investing activities during was the cash used in the acquisitions of precision and republic conduit in the amount of million and capital expenditures in the amount of million 
net cash provided by financing activities the primary source for the net cash provided by financing activities during was the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the primary source for the net cash provided by financing activities during was the million convertible notes issued in june  partially offset by an million decrease in our long term revolving credit facility  a million increase in deferred debt costs and million of regularly scheduled long term debt payments 
the primary source for the net cash provided by financing activities during was the million increase in our long term revolving credit facility  million from the issuance of million shares of common stock and the sale of million shares of treasury stock in the amount of million 
the principal use of the cash flows was the acquisitions of republic conduit and precision 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of december  in thousands 
some of the figures we include in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their durations  anticipated actions by third parties and other factors 
the enforceable and legally binding obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years total debt estimated interest payments operating leases purchase obligations other liabilities total contractual cash obligations amounts represent the expected cash payment for our total debt and do not include deferred issuance costs and the fair market valuation of our current interest rate swap agreement 
amounts represent the expected cash payment for interest on our fixed rate long term debt 
we entered into operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease 
our future operating lease payments would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transactions 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty 
amounts represent other liabilities  where both the timing and amount of payments streams are known 
amounts do not include payments for pension payments for various postretirement benefit plans and payments for deferred taxes and other tax liabilities  as such amounts have not been determined beyond but include expected employer contributions for the year ended december  pension assumptions are as follows discount  expected return on plan assets  and a rate of compensation increase 
our capital expenditure budget for is approximately million 
our capital expenditure budget will be primarily used to construct the new state of the art republic conduit facility for million  expand our existing facility at precision for million and acquire new equipment for our other existing manufacturing facilities 
in addition  our capital expenditure for enhancing our information technology systems and to complete integration efforts with recent acquisitions is approximately million for we expect to meet ongoing working capital and the capital expenditure requirements from a combination of cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
however  this budget could be reduced to help manage liquidity needs 
as of december   we have made several deposits totaling million for equipment to be used in the manufacturing process at our new state of the art republic conduit facility 
critical accounting estimates certain accounting issues require management estimates and judgments for the preparation of financial statements 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements 
therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to these estimates in the md a 
our most significant estimates and judgments are listed below 
goodwill and other intangible assets our acquisitions of precision  republic conduit and seacat have resulted in goodwill of million and other acquired intangibles  net of accumulated amortization  of million 
we conducted the required impairment test of our goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of and determined that no impairment had occurred 
we are required to conduct an impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
management analyzed the valuation of our recent acquisitions by utilizing a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method 
both of these techniques required us to estimate future sales prices and volumes 
we used our internal budgets  which are based on recent sales data and market information as well as current cost of production  to estimate future cash flows 
based on these estimates  we believe the enterprise value of our acquisition continues to be greater than our investment 
while the annual impairment tests did not indicate goodwill impairment  we would be subject to future impairment if the operating results and cash flows of our recent acquisitions would not support the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill 
accounts receivable collectibility we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable for each of our segments based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filing or substantial downgrading of credit  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against the amounts due reducing the net recognized receivable to the amount we estimate will be collected 
for all other customers  we estimate reserves for bad debts based on the length of time receivables have been past due and our experience with receivable collection 
if circumstances change  such as further deterioration in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimate of the recovery could be reduced by a material amount 
our bad debt expense on accounts receivables was million for and million for notes receivable collectibility we evaluate the collectibility of our notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a note holder s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filing  substantial downgrading of credit  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against the amounts due reducing the net recognized receivable to the amount we estimate will be collected 
if circumstances change  such as further deterioration in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimate of the recovery could be reduced by a material amount 
income tax matters the liability method is used for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and regulations 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the tax rate based on the provisions of enacted tax law 
we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous tax authorities 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are generally taxed on income before taxes adjusted for various differences between tax law and gaap accounting 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes 
resolutions of these situations inevitably include some degree of uncertainty 
the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which are difficult to estimate 
these include  but are not limited to  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by tax authorities  the willingness of tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid in canada that either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in the us our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  experience is only a guide  and the potential exists  however limited  that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
we have provided for taxes and interest that we believe may ultimately be payable 
all alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards were used in net operating loss carryforwards with a tax value of million were available at december  management believes that the character and nature of estimated future taxable income will allow for full realization of the associated tax benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire between and  excepting  for which a valuation allowance has been established 
foreign earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the us as a result  no income tax provision has been recorded for us taxes on the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings 
at december   million of foreign tax credit carryforwards were available 
a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the foreign tax credit carryforwards 
pension plans prudential sponsors two pension plans  the hourly plan and the salary plan  and a supplemental executive retirement plan  or serp 
the most significant estimates related to these plans involve the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate 
at december   we have estimated the expected long term rate of return to be and the discount rate  which reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled  to be 
in determining the expected long term and discount rate  we analyze rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments whose portfolio is balanced between equity and fixed income investments 
we monitor the performance of these funds semiannually against asset return benchmarks mandated by prudential s board 
based upon these benchmarks  we believe our pension assumptions are appropriate 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our revolving credit facility which has variable interest rates 
however  we utilize an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our exposure 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings and taking into account the swap agreement in place  it is estimated our interest expense for the year ended december   would not have changed by a material amount 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  we would likely take actions  in addition to the swap agreement currently in place that would mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk  however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  no such actions have been considered 
further  no consideration has been given to the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
steel commodity risk we are also subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of steel 
steel represents approximately sixty percent of our cost of goods sold 
as a result  the steel industry  which is highly volatile and cyclical in nature  significantly affects our business 
we expect our current replacement cost of steel to flow through our cost of goods sold over the next two quarters 
in addition  we depend on a few suppliers for a significant portion of our steel 
the loss of one of our significant steel suppliers or the inability to obtain the necessary amount of steel could have a temporary adverse effect on our ability to produce the quantity of products necessary to sustain our market share  thus impacting our results of operations 
foreign currency risk the company s reported cash flows related to its canadian operations are based on cash flows measured in canadian dollars translated to the us dollar equivalent based on published exchange rates for the period reported 
the company believes its current risk exposure to the exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial
