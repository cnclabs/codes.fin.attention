item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis overview kerr mcgee corporation is one of the largest us based independent oil and gas exploration and production companies and the world s third largest producer and marketer of titanium dioxide pigment in terms of volumes produced 
kerr mcgee has three reportable business segments  oil and gas exploration and production  production and marketing of titanium dioxide pigment chemical pigment  and production and marketing of other chemical products chemical other 
discussion of business developments and results of operations for each of our reportable segments is provided below 
the company announced on march   that its board of directors authorized management to proceed with its proposal to pursue alternatives for the separation of the chemical business  including a spinoff or sale 
in  we merged with westport resources corporation westport  an independent exploration and production company with operations onshore in the united states and in the gulf of mexico 
the merger  which was completed on june   increased our year end proved oil and gas reserves by approximately on a pro forma basis  with year end reserves reaching billion barrels of oil equivalent 
in exchange for westport s common stock and options  kerr mcgee issued stock valued at billion  options valued at million and assumed debt of billion  for a total of billion net of million of cash acquired 
the fair value assigned to assets acquired and goodwill totaled billion 
the westport merger added properties to our oil and gas business that are complementary to existing operations 
we believe this merger improves the risk profile of our assets by adding low risk exploitation opportunities and increasing the weight of us onshore natural gas reserves in our portfolio 
us onshore reserves increased from of total proved reserves at the beginning of the year to at year end  largely as a result of our merger with westport 
additionally  the merger contributed to an increase in proved developed reserves from of total proved reserves at december   to by the end of because the percentage of our reserves located onshore in the us increased  we expect that this area will represent a higher proportion of our worldwide production volumes and a larger share of our total capital spending in the future 
based on our current budget  we expect that us onshore production will represent approximately of our total production in on a barrel of oil equivalent basis  an increase from during  and our capital expenditures in this region are anticipated to increase from of total capital expenditures in to in strategically  kerr mcgee focuses on growing its exploration and production operations and improving profitability of its titanium dioxide pigment business through technological advancements and optimization of assets 
additionally  we continue to concentrate on reducing the company s total debt burden to remain competitive and to increase financial flexibility 
as a result of certain investing and financing activities  including the westport merger  the ratio of total debt to total capitalization improved from at year end to by the end of capitalization is determined as total debt plus stockholders equity 
in february  the company called for redemption all of the million aggregate principal amount of its convertible subordinated debentures due at a price of 
prior to march   the redemption date  all of the debentures were converted by the holders into approximately million shares of common stock 
pro forma for the conversion  the company s year end total debt to total capitalization ratio would have been 
on march   the board of directors authorized the company to proceed with a share repurchase program initially set at billion 
expanded discussion of the company s cash flows  liquidity and capital resources is included in the financial condition section below 
we continue to manage risks associated with our environmental remediation responsibilities 
because of the nature of kerr mcgee s current and historical operations  the company has significant environmental remediation responsibilities and provides reserves for these remediation projects 
during  the company provided million net of reimbursements for environmental remediation and restoration costs  of which million related to discontinued operations  and funded million of expenditures associated with its environmental projects  net of million in reimbursements received from other parties 
a discussion of the status and circumstances surrounding these projects is included in the environmental matters section below

a detailed discussion of each segment s business and properties is included in items and of this annual report on form k 
exploration and production the company s oil and gas business is principally focused on exploration  development and production of crude oil and natural gas 
our core areas of operation are in the gulf of mexico  onshore in the united states  the united kingdom sector of the north sea and china 
in addition  we are actively engaged in exploration efforts within the core areas listed above  as well as in alaska  brazil  morocco  bahamas  benin and other areas 
our exploration and production business is focused on creating shareholder value and profitable growth through exploration  core area exploitation and tactical acquisitions 
the first component of our strategy is deepwater focused exploration in both the gulf of mexico and key international basins  complemented by lower risk exploration activities onshore in the us  gulf of mexico shelf  the north sea and china 
over the past year  kerr mcgee has refined its international new ventures exploration strategy to focus primarily on opportunities in areas with proven world class hydrocarbon basins such as brazil and alaska 
we believe this refined strategy will yield more predictable results from exploration and better year over year growth performance from the drill bit 
cost efficient core area exploitation is a second key component of the company s strategy 
exploitation and development opportunities within our core areas of operation provide the base cash generation capability of our business and ultimately fund exploration growth opportunities 
the company supplements its exploration and exploitation programs with tactical acquisitions in its core producing areas 
we only pursue acquisition opportunities where we can add incremental value through unique geological knowledge  utilization of existing infrastructure in the areas acquired or our ability to lower costs 
commodity prices were relatively high throughout this price strength  coupled with a increase in average daily production volume  enabled us to fund a billion capital expenditure program and still generate significant excess free cash flow 
significant financial and operating milestones achieved by the exploration and production business in included successful completion of the westport merger 
operating profit increased over  reaching a record billion 
average daily production volumes were  barrels of oil equivalent in  an increase of over  largely due to the westport merger 
we anticipate that average daily production will range between  and  barrels of oil equivalent 
replaced of production largely as a result of the westport merger 
achieved first production from the red hawk development in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
the project was completed on time and within budget 
achieved first production from the cfd and cfd development in bohai bay  china 
first production was achieved nearly five months ahead of schedule and within budget 
although the company achieved a number of significant exploration successes in  most were not well enough defined to recognize proved reserves  but may offer potential for future proved reserves additions 
discoveries included ticonderoga working interest in the deepwater gulf of mexico  which will be developed as a subsea tieback to our constitution development 
nikaitchuq in alaska where we drilled two successful wells in an appraisal and testing program designed to delineate the discovery is currently under way 
bmc in the campos basin of brazil 
appraisal of this discovery is ongoing 
cfd in the block in bohai bay  china 
appraisal planning for this discovery is under way  and we expect to spud the first appraisal well in the first quarter of despite these successes and other successful exploratory wells onshore in the us and in the gulf of mexico  the exploration program was unable to deliver an acceptable level of proved reserve additions in  with an exploration based production replacement of only 
to improve the consistency of its exploration performance  the company has refocused its core exploration program in areas with proven world class hydrocarbon basins 
concentrating our exploration in areas where working hydrocarbon systems are known to exist reduces the geologic risk profile for the company  increasing our chances of discovering economically recoverable accumulations of oil and gas 
we believe this shift in focus moves us to a more appropriate overall risk profile 
the merger with westport also is anticipated to provide an important source of future low risk proved reserve additions 
the company believes its refined exploration strategy  supplemented by low to moderate risk offshore satellite opportunities and an active us onshore program focused on contributing to our proved reserves  will improve the consistency of results from exploration and deliver better year over year performance 
the merger with westport added substantial depth  breadth and balance to the company s oil and gas operations 
specifically  the merger expanded the company s base of low risk exploitation projects in the rocky mountains  us gulf coast and the mid continent permian basin areas 
in addition  the merger changed the composition of the company s reserve base  increasing us reserves from at year end to at year end a significant portion of the acquired us reserves are long lived natural gas reservoirs 
the westport merger accelerated the company s growth profile  contributing to a increase in production over since the completion of the merger  we have moved rapidly to capitalize on new exploitation opportunities  with much of our effort focused in two key fields  the greater natural buttes in utah and moxa arch in wyoming 
this exploitation focus is already generating strong results  with production from westport s rocky mountain properties up by over since the merger 
our refined exploration strategy has been designed to put the company on track to deliver improved exploration performance in and beyond 
the company has a large portfolio of low risk exploitation projects  and we intend to capitalize on those opportunities in for  we have planned the largest exploration and development program in the company s history  including some exploration and development wells  billion in capital expenditures and million in exploration costs 
we are committing the resources necessary to effectively execute this program with a goal of delivering growth in both reserves and production 
chemical our chemical business has focused its strategy on its titanium dioxide pigment operations 
as part of this strategic decision  we continue to investigate divestiture options for the electrolytic business and finalized our exit of the forest products business in early results of operations for the forest products business are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in income loss from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
titanium dioxide pigment is produced using one of two different technologies  the chloride process and the sulfate process 
the chloride process produces a pigment with superior brightness and durability preferred by many manufactures of paint  coatings and plastics 
in early  chloride process capacity accounted for of our gross pigment production capacity 
the remaining capacity is sulfate process production  which produces pigment used in paper and specialty products 
in the global titanium dioxide pigment industry  kerr mcgee is the third largest producer and marketer and one of five companies that own chloride technology 
the profitability and cash flows of the company s pigment operations is directly tied to the global demand  consumption and pricing of titanium dioxide pigment  which tends to follow global economic trends discussed in the operating environment and outlook section below 
while the general business environment and pigment pricing play a major role in profitability  execution of asset optimization plans  operations excellence  supply chain management principles  technological innovation and market segmentation further affect performance 
to optimize our assets and improve profitability  the company shut down its savannah  georgia  titanium dioxide pigment sulfate facility in this facility contributed approximately of our total worldwide pigment production in the first half of demand and prices for sulfate anatase pigments  particularly in the paper market  had consistently declined in north america during the past several years 
the decreasing volumes  along with unanticipated environmental and infrastructure issues discovered after kerr mcgee acquired the facility in  created unacceptable financial returns for the facility and contributed to the decision 
in conjunction with this decision  the company also ended production at its savannah gypsum plant that used by product from the sulfate process to manufacture gypsum 
in connection with the shutdown  the company recognized a pretax charge of million during as part of the company s efforts in the area of technological innovation  low cost capacity expansions were added to take advantage of future market growth 
as a result of these efforts  production began through a new high productivity oxidation line at the savannah  georgia  chloride process pigment plant in early this new technology is expected to result in low cost  incremental capacity increases through modification of existing chloride oxidation lines and should allow for improved operating efficiencies through simplification of hardware configurations and reduced maintenance requirements 
the company continues to evaluate the performance of this new oxidation line and expects to have a better understanding of how the savannah site might be reconfigured to exploit its capabilities in the possible reconfiguration of the savannah site  if any  could include redeployment of certain assets  idling of certain assets and reduction of the future useful life of certain assets  resulting in the acceleration of depreciation expense and the recognition of other charges 
the avestor joint venture was created by kerr mcgee and hydro quebec  one of north america s largest utilities  to commercialize and produce a lithium metal polymer battery 
commercial battery production and sales commenced in late to the north american telecommunications industry 
production and sales rates increased during and are expected to continue increasing during avestor s unique technical and product offering capability is expected to create additional high market value opportunities in the electric utility and industrial battery back up energy markets 
with market demand growing  avestor expects to achieve a breakeven operating cash position in and anticipates sales matching plant capacity in operating environment and outlook oil and gas exploration and production commodity markets the oil and gas industry enjoyed strong commodity prices throughout supply and geopolitical uncertainties  combined with strong demand  resulted in historically high prices for the industry 
prices for west texas intermediate wti crude oil averaged per barrel for the year  with a low price of about per barrel occurring in the first quarter and a high price point in excess of per barrel in late october 
crude oil prices were driven largely by geopolitical instabilities in various producing regions  including the middle east  nigeria and venezuela  as well as concerns that world oil production may be challenged to meet overall market demand 
these concerns  coupled with rapidly growing demand  particularly in asian markets  contributed to strong pricing and market volatility 
the year ended with wti crude oil prices at about per barrel 
us natural gas pricing was also strong throughout the year  with new york mercantile exchange nymex futures prices never falling below per million british thermal units mmbtu 
the gas market continues to be driven by fundamental uncertainties regarding the industry s ability to maintain supply in line with increasing demand 
in spite of high gas storage inventories  pricing peaked during the fourth quarter of at around per mmbtu 
late in the fourth quarter  prices moderated in response to continued high inventory levels and mild winter conditions for much of the country 
for the year  nymex natural gas prices averaged about per mmbtu and ended the year at about per mmbtu 
the outlook for the commodity markets in calls for continued volatility 
most experts see prices for both oil and gas moderating  but remaining above historical levels 
to mitigate uncertainties related to oil and gas price fluctuations  the company enters into derivatives to hedge prices expected to be realized upon the sale of future oil and gas production 
details of the company s commodity derivatives are provided in the market risks section below 
industry environment competition in the oil and gas industry for attractive exploration  exploitation and development opportunities is intense 
to meet this competition  kerr mcgee employs a balanced portfolio of attractive exploration opportunities  supplemented by lower risk satellite and onshore exploration prospects and a strong exploitation project inventory 
in addition  the company pursues tactical acquisitions  property exchanges and other business development activity to augment its exploration  exploitation and development programs 
the company s exploration portfolio is anchored by a large acreage and prospect inventory 
the company makes extensive use of technology and highly trained geoscientists to effectively evaluate prospects  reducing pre drill risk to an acceptable level 
the company maintains a dedicated exploration technology group which focuses on d visualization technology  seismic data processing and interpretation  and application of new and emerging technologies to more effectively evaluate exploration prospects 
over the past year  our exploration efforts have been refocused on proven world class hydrocarbon basins to lower the overall risk profile 
the company maintains a core group of highly experienced development personnel to quickly and efficiently exploit attractive new offshore oil and gas discoveries using new technologies 
we currently operate five facilities in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
this infrastructure provides kerr mcgee with a competitive advantage  enabling the company to efficiently employ a hub and spoke concept of satellite exploration and exploitation of nearby opportunities 
one of the company s key strengths is its ability to profitably develop smaller offshore oil and gas discoveries that previously might have been considered uneconomical 
the company s acquisition of hs resources in and westport in mid greatly enhanced its inventory of low risk natural gas exploitation opportunities in the rocky mountain region 
these gas resources are long life reservoirs  which work to stabilize the company s production base 
the relatively low risk nature of these opportunities provides balance to the company s exploration program 
in the uk the company also employs a hub and spoke development philosophy utilizing kerr mcgee s operated infrastructure as a base for satellite exploration and exploitation of nearby opportunities 
the company utilizes regional business development teams to evaluate tactical acquisition and trade opportunities to supplement its exploration and exploitation efforts 
a good example is the recently announced trade of our us onshore arkoma basin properties for british petroleum s interest in the blind faith discovery in the gulf of mexico 
the transaction provided the company with a interest in a new offshore discovery which kerr mcgee plans to quickly develop into new proved reserves and production 
in  with higher commodity prices  the company expects competition for high quality exploration and exploitation opportunities to remain strong 
the company will continue to refine the exploration  exploitation and business development approach described above to gain competitive advantage among its peers 
chemical titanium dioxide is a quality of life product  and its consumption follows general economic trends 
coming off a challenging year in  business conditions for the company s chemical operations improved in due to general strengthening of the global economy 
these economic forces created increases in demand  pushing capacity utilization higher and reduced overall inventory levels  thereby creating an environment favorable for product price gains 
partially offsetting the general economic robustness  were the impacts of higher energy prices on our operations and the weakening of the us dollar  which weakened local pricing dynamics in various global markets 
while overall global economic growth was strong throughout  the last quarter of did begin to show signs of a leveling off in the leading us economic indicators and euro zone gross domestic product 
moving into  general economic conditions are expected to resemble more normal growth patterns  particularly in north america and europe  while asian markets are expected to lead the way  as they did in the strategy for kerr mcgee s chemical unit focuses on continued improvement in asset productivity  process and product capability  cost reductions and providing superior products for market segment growth 
multiple initiatives are being pursued to capture new market growth through segmentation strategies that align products with customer needs  low cost plant modifications to increase production capacity  continuous improvement programs to increase efficiency and lower operating costs  and technology based programs to improve product quality and lower costs 
results of operations consolidated the following discussion presents results of consolidated operations  with additional analysis of segment operations included in results of operations by segment 
revenues the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher average realized sales prices and higher sales volumes for crude oil  natural gas and titanium dioxide pigment 
approximately of the growth in consolidated revenues was generated by our oil and gas exploration and production segment 
oil and gas sales volumes on a barrel of oil equivalent basis increased over volumes as a result of the westport merger completed in june oil and gas sales volumes declined in compared to primarily due to property divestitures 
average prices realized from sales of oil and gas  including the effect of realized losses on our hedging contracts  increased by in and in as a result of stronger commodity prices 
gas marketing sales revenues increased by million in and million in largely as a result of higher natural gas marketing volumes and prices 
these increases were offset by higher gas purchase costs 
improvement in the general economic conditions favorably affected pigment sales volumes in and  contributing to growth in our consolidated revenues 
a summary of components of changes in consolidated revenues over the three year period ended december   is presented below 
additional analysis of factors contributing to these changes is included in results of operations by segment 
millions of dollars vs

the increase in lease operating expenses is primarily attributable to the westport merger 
cost of natural gas marketed and associated transportation expenses increased by million  more than offsetting the increase in gas marketing sales revenues discussed above 
additionally  higher pigment sales volume and average cost contributed to the increase 
costs and operating expenses for increased million over  primarily due to higher gas marketing costs of million which offset higher gas marketing sales revenues  higher pigment production costs of million and plant shutdown provisions associated with the closure of the synthetic rutile facility in mobile  alabama 
these increases were partially offset by lower lease operating expense of million  mainly due to oil and gas property divestitures 
millions of dollars vs

costs and operating expenses increase decrease in lease operating expense gas purchase costs costs associated with plant shutdowns pigment production costs other costs and operating expenses total change in costs and operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease of million from to was mainly due to certain expenses that did not reoccur  partially offset by higher compensation costs 
in  we initiated a work force reduction program and recorded a total charge of million  of which million was included as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses and million was included in other categories of operating expenses 
an additional million of costs associated with the work force reduction program was incurred in recurring employee related costs  primarily incentive compensation  increased by million in during  selling  general and administrative expenses increased over  primarily due to provisions associated with the work force reduction program and additional compensation expense resulting from loan prepayments required to release shares from the company s employee stock ownership plan 
additionally  higher expense associated with incentive compensation awards and pension and postretirement benefits contributed to the increase 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in litigation provisions 
in  we recognized a charge of million mainly related to certain forest products litigation in mississippi  louisiana and pennsylvania 
this litigation is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
millions of dollars vs

depreciation and depletion increase decrease in oil and gas depletion due to change in depletion rates oil and gas depletion due to change in sales volumes chemical segment accelerated depreciation other depreciation total change in depreciation and depletion exploration expense total exploration expense of million in remained substantially unchanged from exploration expense in was higher than in by million 
components of exploration expense are further analyzed in results of operations by segment exploration and production 
interest and debt expense interest and debt expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million was due to an increase in capitalized interest and higher realized gains on interest rate swaps designated to hedge the fair value of our debt 
for additional information regarding these instruments  refer to the market risks section below 
the decrease from to was attributable to lower average borrowings under revolving credit facilities and commercial paper of approximately million and slightly lower average interest rates on the company s long term debt 
shipping and handling expenses shipping and handling expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
an analysis of transportation and shipping and handling expenses is provided in results of operations by segment below 
accretion expense accretion expense for and was million and million  respectively 
the increase during resulted primarily from an increase in our asset retirement obligations associated with westport properties 
asset impairments asset impairment charges totaled million in  million in and million in our chemical pigment segment incurred an asset impairment of million in related to the shutdown of the sulfate process titanium dioxide pigment production at the savannah  georgia  plant 
the remaining asset impairment charges were related to our exploration and production segment and are discussed in more detail in results of operations by segment exploration and production 
gains losses associated with assets held for sale net gains losses associated with assets held for sale in  and were million  million and million  respectively  all of which related to our oil and gas exploration and production segment 
additional discussion of these gains and losses is provided in results of operations by segment exploration and production 
taxes  other than income taxes taxes  other than income taxes totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and includes million  million and million  respectively  of oil and gas production and ad valorem taxes 
because oil and gas production taxes are generally determined as a percentage of oil and gas sales revenues  they fluctuate with changes in oil and gas sales volumes and realized prices 
oil and gas production and ad valorem taxes increased million in compared to due to higher sales volumes primarily as a result of the westport merger and higher realized prices 
the decrease from to was caused by elimination of royalty payments in the uk north sea and lower sales volumes due to property divestitures 
taxes  other than income taxes also includes payroll and ad valorem taxes  which did not change significantly over the three year period ended december  provision for environmental remediation and restoration provision for environmental remediation and restoration  net of reimbursements  totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our environmental obligations are discussed in detail under environmental matters below 
other income expense other income expense totaled million  million and million  which included million  million and million in  and  respectively  of net foreign currency losses 
the majority of the foreign currency losses resulted from the company s uk operations due to unfavorable changes in the uk dollar british pound sterling exchange rates 
additionally  equity in net losses of equity method investees  net of gains  totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and were primarily the result of the investment in the avestor joint venture formed in to develop lithium metal polymer batteries 
these losses were partially offset in and by gains on sales of devon common stock 
in december  we sold a portion of our investment in devon shares classified as available for sale  resulting in a pretax gain of million 
the remaining shares classified as available for sale were sold in january for a pretax gain of million 
through august   we also held million shares of devon common stock classified as trading 
on august   these shares were distributed to the holders of our debt exchangeable for common stock to repay the debt at maturity 
during  and through august   other income expense included net gains of million  million and million representing changes in the fair value of devon common stock classified as trading and changes in the estimated fair value of options embedded in the debt exchangeable for common stock 
provision benefit for income taxes the effective tax rate for was  compared with in and in the effective tax rate declined in because of decreased proportion of income from continuing operations attributable to foreign operations 
the tax benefit was reduced from the us statutory rate due to deferred tax expense of million associated with a increase in the uk corporate tax rate for oil and gas companies  together with the impact of taxation on foreign operations 
income loss from discontinued operations the company recognized a loss from discontinued operations as a result of its decision to dispose of the forest products business of million  million and million  net of tax benefit  for the years  and  respectively 
prior to its disposition  the forest product business reqresented a componet of our chemical other segment 
the income from discontinued operations also includes income of million including tax benefit of million resulting from the company s decision in early to dispose of its exploration and production interests in indonesia and kazakhstan and its interest in the bayu undan project in the east timor sea offshore australia 
the million income included a net pretax gain on sale of million associated with the divestitures 
these divestiture decisions were made as part of the company s strategic plan to rationalize noncore chemical and oil and gas assets 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we recognized a loss of million net of income tax benefit of million in upon adoption  as of january   of financial accounting standards board statement no 
fas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
adoption of this standard also resulted in an increase in net property of million  an increase in abandonment liabilities of million and a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities of million

oil production of thousand barrels per day mbbls d in represented an increase of almost over levels  primarily due to the contribution of westport assets acquired in late june mbbls d 
in addition  china s cfd fields started producing in july and the gulf of mexico s gunnison field  which began production in the fourth quarter of  contributed to the increase 
production volume increases in the us and china were partially offset by a decline in north sea production 
the north sea production decrease was primarily due to declines at tullich  harding and leadon  partially offset by strong development drilling results at the gryphon field 
average oil prices  including the effect of hedging activity  increased per barrel in  resulting in a million increase in sales revenues 
oil production in was mbbls d  down compared to  primarily due to the sale of various noncore properties during and the company began a divestiture program in mid to improve the overall quality of its asset portfolio  targeting high operating cost  noncore assets 
the program was completed in property sales were concentrated in the us onshore area  gulf of mexico shelf and the north sea  as well as ecuador and the south china sea 
after adjusting for divestitures  oil production was approximately the same as oil sales revenues decreased million in compared with  primarily as a result of lower production due to the property divestitures in and the effect of the mbbl d decrease in oil production on sales revenues was partially offset by the effect of higher realized prices 
the average realized price  including the effect of hedging activity increased per barrel  adding million to oil sales revenues  while lower oil production reduced revenues by million 
natural gas sales revenues and production natural gas sales revenues increased million in compared to as a result of a increase in gas production  combined with a 
per mcf increase in the average realized price 
gas production in was mmcf per day  mmcf per day above annual production  contributing an additional million in gas sales revenues 
gas production increased as a result of additional production from westport assets  which contributed approximately mmcf per day in in addition  new production from deepwater gulf of mexico fields  primarily red hawk and gunnison  offset declines that occurred in the us onshore area  as well as the north sea tullich field 
the red hawk field began production in july higher realized gas prices provided an additional million in gas sales revenues  averaging per mcf  including the impact of hedging activity 
natural gas sales revenues in were million higher than in  primarily as a result of a per mcf increase in the average realized price for natural gas  partially offset by a decline in production 
higher realized prices in increased revenue by million  while lower gas production reduced revenues by million 
production declines resulted primarily from property divestitures concentrated in the us onshore and gulf of mexico shelf areas 
after adjusting for divestitures  gas production volumes declined by compared with other revenues other revenues include gas processing plant and gathering system revenues in the us onshore area  along with oil tariffs and non equity oil and gas sales in the uk gas marketing activities in the rocky mountain area are discussed below 
other revenues totaled million in  an increase of million over the increase is primarily the result of higher us commodity prices impacting sales generated from the company s ownership interest in gas plants and gathering systems located in louisiana and colorado million 
in addition  the north sea generated higher revenues from resale of nonequity gas  an increase of million in compared with other revenues increased by million in from million reported in the increase is primarily due to higher us natural gas prices favorably impacting gas processing plant and gas gathering revenues in the us onshore area 
nonhedge derivative losses nonhedge derivative losses represent net realized and unrealized gains and losses related to crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments that have not been designated as hedges or that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
in the second quarter of  we entered into financial derivative instruments in the form of fixed price swaps and costless collars relating to specified quantities of projected production that was not already hedged  including unhedged production from the westport properties 
certain crude oil and natural gas swaps covering the period from august to december were characterized initially as nonhedge derivatives since either our us production excluding westport volumes was already hedged or  in the case of rocky mountain production  we did not have sufficient basis swaps in place to ensure that the hedges would be highly effective 
consequently  we recognized mark to market losses of million in earnings during the second quarter associated with these derivatives 
after the westport merger closed and with sufficient oil and gas production available  these swaps were designated as hedges and  as such  realized gains and losses thereafter were recognized in earnings when the hedged production was sold 
in connection with the westport merger  we recognized a million net liability associated with westport s existing commodity derivatives at the merger date june  
some of these derivative instruments were designated as hedges in july in connection with the redesignation of acquisition related derivatives described above  while others do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
in the second quarter of  we recognized a mark to market gain of million in earnings since the value of the net derivative liability had decreased to million by june  westport s derivatives in place at the merger date consisted of fixed price oil and gas swaps  natural gas basis swaps  and costless and three way collars 
the swaps qualify for hedge accounting and were designated as hedges after the merger date 
accordingly  future realized gains and losses on those derivative instruments are reflected in earnings when the hedged production is sold 
however  the costless and three way collars each of which was in a liability position do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under existing accounting standards because they represent net written options at the merger date 
as a result  even though these collars effectively reduce commodity price risk  we will continue to recognize mark to market gains and losses in earnings until the collars mature  rather than defer such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in the second half of  we recognized losses of million associated with westport s collars 
the net derivative liability associated with these derivatives at year end was million

lease operating expense during  lease operating expense increased or million compared with on a per unit basis  lease operating expense increased 
per barrel of oil equivalent boe to per boe compared to per boe for the increase was primarily due to additional operating expenses associated with westport assets million  start up production costs at china s cfd fields  and higher expense in the gulf of mexico deepwater related to an operating lease for platform infrastructure at the gunnison field 
also contributing to the increase were higher pension and contract labor costs for nonoperated properties in the north sea 
a charge of million in  or 
per boe  for a property insurance premium adjustment primarily associated with higher industry losses due to hurricane ivan  also contributed to the year over year increase 
lease operating expense in was million lower than  a decrease of 
on a per unit basis  lease operating expense decreased by about to per boe in from per boe in lower operating expenses were primarily related to the divestment of noncore  high operating cost properties in and early production and ad valorem taxes production and ad valorem taxes are comprised primarily of severance taxes associated with properties located onshore and in state waters in the us these taxes  which usually are based on a percentage of oil and gas sales revenues  increased million in as a result of higher commodity prices and higher sales volumes 
the addition of westport s properties resulted in higher production taxes as a percentage of sales revenues by increasing the proportion of us onshore properties subject to production taxes in our portfolio 
production taxes of million in were million lower than primarily due to the elimination of royalty payments in the uk north sea and lower production volumes 
these factors were partially offset by the impact of higher commodity prices on production taxes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a dd a expense of million for increased million over the prior year  primarily caused by additional dd a expense for the recently acquired westport properties million 
on a per unit basis  dd a increased from per boe in to per boe in  reflecting the impact of the westport merger which had a higher acquisition cost per boe than our historical asset base 
in addition  dd a unit costs increased in the north sea area due to a reduction in the expected life and field facility salvage values on certain fields  combined with the impact of changes in reserve estimates 
we expect per unit dd a costs to average between per boe and per boe 
dd a expense in was million  representing a decline compared with the decrease was primarily the result of reduced production due to the divestiture program that began in mid and asset impairments that were recorded in primarily the leadon field 
on a per unit basis  dd a expense increased to per boe in from per boe in although total dd a expense was lower  per unit costs increased  reflecting the company s divestiture activity and a change in the overall mix of producing properties between and in accordance with accounting standards  depletion expense was not recorded for various assets that were designated as held for sale in  although production quantities for these properties continued to be included in the calculation of overall per unit dd a 
accretion expense accretion expense increased by million in compared to  reflecting an increase in our asset retirement obligations associated with the westport properties 
accretion expense of million in resulted from the initial implementation of fas no

asset impairments and gain loss associated with assets held for sale kerr mcgee records impairment losses when performance analysis and other factors indicate that future net cash flows from production will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of the related assets 
in general  such write downs often occur on mature properties that are nearing the end of their productive lives or cease production sooner than anticipated 
asset impairment losses recorded in and totaled million and million  respectively 
asset impairment losses in related in large part million to two us gulf of mexico fields that experienced premature water breakthrough and ceased production sooner than expected 
in addition  an million impairment loss was recognized for a north sea field that is no longer certain to be developed and a million impairment loss was recognized for other minor us onshore properties 
the impairments of million related to mature oil and gas producing assets in the us onshore and gulf of mexico shelf areas 
the impairment charges of million in included million for the leadon field in the uk north sea  million for certain nonoperated north sea fields and million for several older gulf of mexico shelf properties 
negative reserve revisions stemming from additional performance analysis of these properties during resulted in revised estimates of future cash flows from the properties that were less than the carrying values of the related assets 
for additional information regarding the leadon field  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the company recognized a net loss on sale of assets of million in the loss was associated primarily with the conveyance of the company s interest in a nonproducing gulf of mexico field to another participating partner million  as well as losses of million and gains of million on sales of noncore properties in the gulf of mexico shelf and us onshore areas 
at december   the company had oil and gas properties with a carrying amount of million classified as held for sale and  from time to time  may identify other oil and gas properties to be disposed of that are considered noncore or nearing the end of their productive lives 
in connection with the company s divestiture program initiated in  certain oil and gas properties were identified for disposal and classified as held for sale properties 
upon classification as held for sale  the carrying value of the related properties is analyzed in relation to the estimated fair value less costs to sell  and losses are recognized if necessary 
upon ultimate disposal of the properties  any gain or additional loss on sale is recognized 
losses of million and gains of million were recognized in upon conclusion of the divestiture program in the us and north sea  and for the sale of the company s interests in the south china sea liuhua field and other noncore us properties onshore and gulf of mexico shelf areas 
the company recognized losses of million in associated with oil and gas properties held for sale in the us onshore and gulf of mexico shelf areas  the uk north sea and ecuador 
proceeds realized from these disposals totaled million in and million in the proceeds from the sale of these properties were used to reduce long term debt 
transportation expense transportation expense  representing the costs paid to third party providers to transport oil and gas production  increased by million during  to million 
the increase was due to additional transportation costs associated with the westport assets million and the new deepwater gulf of mexico red hawk and gunnison fields 
the increase was partially offset by lower costs in the north sea due to lower sales volumes in on a per unit basis  transportation expense was 
per boe compared to 
per boe in transportation costs in of million were million  or  higher than as a result of higher costs associated with new deepwater gulf of mexico producing fields  partially offset by lower expense in the north sea area 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was per boe for  a decrease of 
per boe compared to total general and administrative expense of million was million higher than contributing to the increase was higher incentive compensation and pension costs  as well as additional administrative and personnel costs associated with the westport merger million 
the increase in was offset partially by lower costs as compared to associated with the workforce reduction program and the employee stock ownership plan 
general and administrative expense in was million higher than in of this increase  million was due to employee severance and related costs attributed to the company s workforce reduction program and additional compensation expense associated with the employee stock purchase plan 
additionally  the company incurred higher costs in associated with pension and other employee benefits 
these cost increases were offset partially by lower costs for direct labor and contract services exploration expense millions of dollars exploration costs geological and geophysical costs dry hole expense amortization of undeveloped leases sales of unproved properties total exploration expense exploration costs include delay rentals  cost of retaining and carrying unproved properties and exploration department overhead 
in  total exploration expense was million  an increase of million 
exploration activity associated with westport assets contributed million to exploration expense in additionally  geological and geophysical data acquisition and processing costs increased in due to activity in the company s international areas  such as brazil  morocco and the bahamas  as well as other new venture areas 
partially offsetting these increases were lower dry hole costs  lower amortization of undeveloped leases and a gain on sale of unproved properties 
the gain on sale of unproved properties related primarily to reimbursement of past exploration costs by new partners purchasing an interest in our morocco activities 
exploration expense in was million higher than in primarily as a result of higher dry hole costs from increased exploration activity during the year 
in addition  staffing levels were increased during to support the company s worldwide exploration efforts and continued development of the company s high potential prospect inventory 
capitalized costs in our consolidated balance sheet associated with exploratory wells may be charged to earnings in a future period if management determines that commercial quantities of hydrocarbons have not been discovered 
at december   the company had capitalized costs of approximately million associated with such ongoing exploration activities  primarily in the deepwater gulf of mexico  brazil  alaska and china

the company continues to evaluate the performance of this new oxidation line and expects to have a better understanding of how the savannah site might be reconfigured to exploit its capabilities in the possible reconfiguration of the savannah site  if any  could include redeployment of certain assets  idling of certain assets and reduction of the future useful life of certain assets  resulting in the acceleration of depreciation expense and the recognition of other charges 
chemical other operating loss for was million on revenues of million  compared with operating loss of million on revenues of million in the increase in revenues of million was primarily due to an increase in electrolytic sales due primarily to the full year of operations at the company s electrolytic manganese dioxide emd manufacturing operation in henderson  nevada see further discussion below

in response to the pricing activities of importing companies  kerr mcgee chemical llc filed a petition for the imposition of anti dumping duties with the us department of commerce international trade administration and the us international trade commission on july  in its petition  the company alleged that manufacturers in certain countries export emd to the united states in violation of the us anti dumping laws and requested that the us department of commerce apply anti dumping duties to the emd imported from such countries 
the department of commerce found probable cause to believe that manufacturers in the specified countries engaged in dumping and initiated an anti dumping investigation with respect to such manufacturers 
partly as a result of the anti dumping petition  demand for us emd product increased  and the plant resumed operations in december the company withdrew its anti dumping petition in february but continues to monitor market conditions 
financial condition the following table provides certain information useful in analysis of the company s financial condition at december   and millions of dollars current ratio to to to total debt total debt less decs stockholders equity debt to total capitalization total debt less decs to total capitalization floating rate debt to total debt fixed rate debt with interest rate swaps to variable rate is treated as floating rate debt represents a ratio of current assets to current liabilities 
under the terms of the company s debt exchangeable for stock decs which matured on august   we had an option to redeem our debt obligation by distributing shares of devon energy corporation devon common stock to the debt holders 
the decs were redeemed at maturity through the distribution of devon stock 
certain ratios and measures are provided excluding the effect of decs balances at december  and to demonstrate the effect on our financial condition of debt obligations that require the use of cash 
additional information regarding the decs and their redemption is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
capitalization is determined as total debt or total debt less decs  as applicable  plus total stockholders equity

during  we reduced the percentage of total debt to total capitalization from to  despite the assumption of approximately billion of debt in the westport merger 
activities contributing to this change in the leverage ratio are outlined below 
westport debt assumed in the merger was repaid shortly after completing the merger with net proceeds from the issuance of million principal amount of notes due and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in connection with the merger  we issued million shares of common stock to former westport shareholders  increasing stockholders equity by billion 
net income exceeded dividends declared  increasing equity by million 
in addition to repaying westport debt  we reduced total debt by million  including the redemption of million principal amount of decs through distribution of devon shares 
kerr mcgee operates with the philosophy that over a five year plan period the company s capital expenditures and dividends should be funded by cash generated from operations 
on a cumulative basis  the cash generated from operations for the past five years has exceeded the company s capital expenditures excluding cash spent for acquisitions and dividend payments 
debt and equity transactions are utilized for acquisition opportunities and short term needs due to timing of cash flow 
the company s future debt level depends on our future results of operations  our capital expenditure program  and requirements for and sources of cash associated with asset acquisitions and dispositions 
discussion on the company s borrowing capacity available to meet unanticipated cash requirements is included in the liquidity section below 
in february  we called for redemption all of the million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated debentures due at a price of 
prior to march   the redemption date  all of the debentures were converted by the holders into approximately million shares of common stock 
as a result of this conversion  the number of total common shares outstanding increased to approximately million 
pro forma for the conversion  our year end total debt to total capitalization ratio would have been 
on march   the company s board of directors the board authorized the company to proceed with a share repurchase program initially set at billion 
the board expects to expand the share repurchase program as the chemical business separation proceeds 
the initial billion share repurchase program primarily will be financed through the use of free cash flow generated from operations after planned capital expenditures  which is projected to be approximately million in the company also expects to utilize a portion of its existing bank credit facility and may issue new securities  which may be in the form of debt or perpetual preferred stock  to fund the remaining repurchase program 
the company still intends to retire million of debt maturities due in in addition to the conversion of subordinated debentures discussed above 
the board and management reiterated their commitment to maintain an investment grade credit rating 
the timing and final number of shares to be repurchased under an expanded repurchase program will depend on the outcome of the chemical business separation  as well as business and market conditions  applicable securities law limitations and other factors 
shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices  and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
cash flows we rely on cash flows from operating activities as a primary source of liquidity 
as necessary  this source has been supplemented by accessing credit lines and commercial paper markets and issuing equity and debt securities 

cashflow 
jpg 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased by million  from billion in to billion in our merger with westport in june contributed to an increase in oil and gas production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis of over average prices realized upon the sale of oil and gas  including hedging activities  increased by 
the combined effect of these factors contributed significantly to the increase in cash flows from operating activities 
additionally  in  our environmental cash expenditures  net of reimbursements received  were lower compared to the prior year 
these positive effects on cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by higher contributions made to postretirement and pension plans and higher expenditures for operating costs primarily due to the westport merger 
cash used in investing activities including dry hole costs  we invested billion  billion and billion in our capital program in  and  respectively 
the million increase in capital expenditures and dry hole costs in was primarily related to higher spending onshore in the us  where our drilling program was expanded following the westport merger 
the capital program for was million lower than in the prior year  resulting primarily from lower capital expenditures in the north sea and us onshore regions  partially offset by higher capital expenditures in the gulf of mexico and china and higher dry hole costs 
our merger with westport was financed by issuing common stock and assuming westport s debt obligations and  therefore  did not affect investing cash flows  except for westport cash balances of million acquired in the merger 
during  we invested million in selected oil and gas property acquisitions for an additional interest in the uk gryphon and south gryphon fields and an onshore property acquisition in south texas 
additionally  in  we completed the divestiture of several oil and gas properties and other assets  generating proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used primarily to pay down debt 
cash outlays for investing activities during  and include investment by the chemical unit in avestor  its lithium metal polymer battery joint venture in canada  of million  million and million  respectively 
other investing cash inflows included million in and million in in proceeds related to the sale of devon stock 
by the end of  all of the shares of devon common stock were disposed of either through sale or in settlement of our decs obligation discussed in the financial condition section above 
cash used in financing activities in  we repaid billion of debt  including debt assumed in the westport merger 
the million balance outstanding under the westport revolving credit facility at the date of the merger was repaid upon completion of the merger and the facility was terminated on july  we also redeemed the westport notes assumed in the merger for million including a make whole premium of million and repaid million in for scheduled repayments and maturities of our debt 
on july   we issued notes due for net proceeds of million 
proceeds from the notes issuance were used to redeem the westport notes discussed above 
in  we also paid million to settle derivative liabilities assumed from westport 
dividends paid in were million  an increase of million compared to this increase primarily resulted from the issuance of million shares of our common stock in the westport merger 
we received proceeds from employee stock option exercises of million in with more stock option exercises compared to prior years as a result of the westport merger and the increasing price of our common stock 
liquidity the company believes that it has the ability to provide for its operational needs and its long and short term capital programs through its cash flows from operating activities  borrowing capacity and ability to raise capital 
the company s primary source of funds has been from operating cash flows  which could be adversely affected by declines in oil  natural gas and pigment prices  all of which can be volatile  as discussed under operating environment and outlook 
our hedging program is intended to partially mitigate variability in operating cash flows caused by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
at december   commodity derivatives covered approximately of our projected oil and gas production 
the portion of our projected production subject to commodity derivative instruments is determined by management and may change in future periods in response to market conditions and our operational needs 
if operating cash flows decline  the company may reduce its capital expenditures program  borrow under its commercial paper program  draw upon its revolving credit facility and or consider selective long term borrowings or equity issuances 
our commercial paper programs are backed by the revolving credit facility currently in place 
in november  the company entered into a billion unsecured revolving credit agreement with a term of five years 
concurrent with this transaction  we terminated two revolving credit facilities with an aggregate maximum availability of billion 
a portion of the billion revolving credit facility can be used to support commercial paper borrowings in the us and europe by certain wholly owned subsidiaries and are guaranteed by the parent company 
borrowings under the credit agreement can be made in us dollars  british pound sterling and euros 
interest on borrowings under the new revolving credit facility may be based  at the company s option  on libor  euribor or on the jpmorgan prime rate 
the interest rate margin varies based on facility utilization and the company s debt rating  utilizing the two highest of the company s senior unsecured debt ratings by moody s  standard and poors s p  and fitch in determining the spread above the applicable interest rate index 
at year end  the company had a maximum available capacity under the revolving credit facility and bank lines of credit of billion and million outstanding in commercial paper borrowings 
at december   the company classified its million of short term commercial paper borrowings as long term debt based on its ability and intent  as evidenced by committed credit agreements  to refinance this debt on a long term basis 
the company s practice has been to continually refinance its commercial paper or draw on its backup facilities  while maintaining borrowing levels believed to be appropriate 
additional information on the company s debt is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the company has available  to issue and sell  a total of billion of debt securities  common or preferred stock  or warrants under its shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission  which was last updated in february additionally  the company maintains an accounts receivable monetization program  which provides an additional source of liquidity up to a maximum of million 
this program is discussed in detail in the off balance sheet arrangements section that follows 
the company had negative working capital at the end of  however  that is not indicative of a lack of liquidity as the company maintains sufficient current assets to settle current liabilities when due 
cash balances are minimized as one way to finance capital expenditures and lower borrowing costs 
additionally  our working capital position is affected by current assets and liabilities associated with our financial derivatives 
at december   the company had recorded approximately million of net current derivative liabilities for contracts that will effectively adjust the cash flows to be realized upon the sale of our future oil and gas production and chemical products 
because those sales have not yet occurred  the associated accounts receivable are not yet reflected in our consolidated balance sheet  while derivative assets and liabilities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
because of the high degree of volatility in oil and natural gas commodity markets  our working capital position will be continually affected by changes in the fair value of derivative instruments 
certain of our derivative financial instruments require margin deposits if unrealized losses exceed limits established with individual counterparty institutions 
from time to time  we may be required to advance cash to our counterparties to satisfy margin deposit requirements 
no margin deposits were outstanding at december  our long term debt agreements do not contain subjective acceleration clauses commonly referred to as material adverse change clauses  however  certain of our long term debt agreements contain restrictive covenants  including a maximum total debt to total capitalization ratio  as defined in the agreements  of 
at december   the company had a total debt to capitalization ratio of and was in compliance with its other debt covenants 
as discussed under financial condition above  million of our convertible subordinated debentures were converted to common stock in march pro forma for the conversion  our year end total debt to total capitalization ratio would have been 
as of december   the company s senior unsecured debt was rated bbb by s p and fitch and baa by moody s 
in march  moody s  s p and fitch each issued a press release indicating the company was under review for a possible downgrade 
the rating agency announcements were primarily in response to a recent shareholder proposal to execute a large share repurchase program using proceeds from a volumetric production payment vpp 
the board rejected the vpp proposal as irresponsible and not in the best interests of stockholders  creditors and the company 
the board of directors did  however  approve a billion share repurchase program on march   as discussed in financial condition above 
following the company s announcement of the share repurchase program  s p lowered the company s credit rating from bbb to bbb 
the downgrade by s p will result in a basis point increase in borrowing costs under our revolving credit facility 
in rating the company s debt  the agencies consider our financial and operating risk profile by analyzing our debt levels  growth profile  cost structure  oil and gas reserve replacement ratios  capital expenditure requirements  contingencies  dividend policy and any other factors they deem relevant that could potentially impact our ability to service our debt 
should the company s commercial paper or debt ratings be further downgraded  borrowing costs will increase  and the company may experience a loss of investor interest in its debt instruments as evidenced by a reduction in the number of investors and or amounts they are willing to invest 
if two of the three rating agencies lowered the company s debt rating to bb or ba  the company s borrowing costs would increase basis points from year end levels 
as discussed in the off balance sheet arrangements section that follows  ratings downgrade below specified levels would result in modifications to or termination of our accounts receivable monetization program 
in connection with the march  share repurchase program announcement  the company s board and management reiterated their commitment to maintain an investment grade credit rating 
off balance sheet arrangements during and  the company identified certain financing needs that it determined would be best handled by off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
three leasing arrangements were entered into for financing the company s working interest obligations for production platforms and related equipment at three company operated fields in the gulf of mexico 
also  the company entered into an accounts receivable monetization program to sell its receivables from certain pigment customers 
each of these transactions has provided specific financing for the company s business needs and or projects and does not expose the company to significant additional risks or commitments 
the leases have provided a tax efficient method of financing a portion of these major development projects  and the sale of the pigment receivables offers an attractive low cost source of liquidity 
spar platform leases during  the company entered into a leasing arrangement for its interest in the production platform and related equipment for the gunnison field in the garden banks area of the gulf of mexico 
this leasing arrangement is similar to two arrangements entered into in for the nansen and boomvang fields in the east breaks area of the gulf of mexico 
in each of these three arrangements  the company entered into lease commitments with separate business trusts that were created to construct independent spar production platforms for each field development 
under the terms of the agreements  the company s share of construction costs for the platforms was initially financed by synthetic lease credit facilities between the trust and groups of financial institutions for million  million and million for gunnison  nansen and boomvang  respectively  with the company making lease payments sufficient to pay interest at varying rates on the financings 
upon completion of the construction phase  separate business trusts with third party equity participants acquired the assets and became the lessor owner of the platforms and related equipment 
the company and these trusts have entered into operating leases for the use of the spar platforms and related equipment 
during  the nansen and boomvang synthetic leases were converted to operating lease arrangements upon completion of construction of the respective production platforms 
completion of the gunnison platform occurred in december  at which time a portion of the gunnison synthetic lease was converted to an operating lease 
the remaining portion of the gunnison synthetic lease was converted to an operating lease on january  under this type of financing structure  the company leases the platforms under operating lease agreements  and neither the platform assets nor the related debt is recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
however  since only a portion of the gunnison synthetic lease had been converted to an operating lease structure as of december   the remaining assets and liabilities of the synthetic lessor trust were included in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  since the remaining portion of the gunnison synthetic lease was converted to an operating lease structure in january  the platform assets and related debt are not included in our consolidated balance sheet at december  for additional information regarding gunnison trust consolidation see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
in conjunction with the operating lease agreements  the company has guaranteed that the residual values of the nansen  boomvang and gunnison platforms at the end of the operating leases shall be equal to at least of their fair market value at the inception of the lease 
for nansen and boomvang  the guaranteed values are million and million  respectively  in  and for gunnison the guaranteed value is million in estimated future minimum annual rentals under these leases and the residual value guarantees are shown in the table of contractual obligations below 
accounts receivable monetization program in december  the company began an accounts receivable monetization program for its pigment business through the sale of selected accounts receivable with a three year  credit insurance backed asset securitization program 
on july   the company restructured the existing accounts receivable monetization program to include the sale of receivables originated by the company s european chemical operations 
during the third quarter of  the company completed its renewal of the program  extending the term through july  the maximum availability under the program is million 
under the terms of the program  selected qualifying customer accounts receivable are sold monthly to a special purpose entity spe  which in turn sells an undivided ownership interest in the receivables to a third party multi seller commercial paper conduit sponsored by an independent financial institution 
the company sells  and retains an interest in  excess receivables to the spe as over collateralization for the program 
the company s retained interest in the spe s receivables is classified in trade accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the retained interest is subordinate to  and provides credit enhancement for  the conduit s ownership interest in the spe s receivables  and is available to the conduit to pay certain fees or expenses due to the conduit  and to absorb credit losses incurred on any of the spe s receivables in the event of termination 
however  the company believes that the risk of credit loss is very low since its bad debt experience has historically been insignificant 
the company retains servicing responsibilities and receives a servicing fee of of the receivables sold for the period of time outstanding  generally to days 
no recourse obligations were recorded since the company has no obligations for any recourse actions on the sold receivables 
the company also holds preference stock in the spe  which essentially represents a retained deposit to provide further credit enhancements  if needed  but otherwise is recoverable by the company at the end of the program 
the carrying value of our investment in the preference stock was million at december  and the program includes a ratings downgrade trigger in the event kerr mcgee s corporate senior unsecured debt rating falls below bbb by s p or baa by moody s  or in the event such rating has been suspended or withdrawn by s p or moody s 
the result of the downgrade trigger is an increase in the cost of the program  along with other program modifications 
in addition  the program includes a ratings downgrade termination event  upon which the program effectively liquidates over time and the third party multi seller commercial paper conduit is repaid by the collections on accounts receivable sold by the spe 
the ratings downgrade termination event is triggered if kerr mcgee s corporate senior unsecured debt i is rated less than bbb by s p and baa by moody s  ii is rated less than bb by s p or ba by moody s or iii is withdrawn or suspended by s p or moody s 
at year end and  the outstanding balance on receivables sold under the program totaled million 
sale leaseback transactions during and  the company entered into sale leaseback arrangements with general electric capital corporation gecc covering assets associated with a gas gathering system in the wattenberg field 
the lease agreements were entered into for the purpose of monetizing certain of the gathering system assets 
the sales price for the equipment was million 
the sales price for the equipment was million  however  an million settlement obligation existed for equipment previously covered by the lease agreement  resulting in net cash proceeds of million in the operating lease agreements have an initial term of five years  with two month renewal options  and the company may elect to purchase the equipment at specified amounts after the end of the fourth year 
the operating lease agreement has an initial term of four years  with two month renewal options 
in the event the company does not purchase the equipment and it is returned to gecc  the company guarantees a residual value ranging from million at the end of the initial terms to million at the end of the last renewal option 
the company recorded no gain or loss associated with the gecc sale leaseback agreements 
estimated future minimum annual rentals under this agreement and the residual value guarantee are shown in the table of contractual obligations below 
other arrangements in conjunction with the company s sale of its ecuadorean assets  which included the company s nonoperating interest in the oleoducto de crudos pesados ltd 
ocp pipeline  the company entered into a performance guarantee agreement with the buyer for the benefit of ocp 
execution of the guarantee by kerr mcgee was required to obtain the necessary cooperation and consents from ocp to close the company s sale of its ecuadorean assets 
under the terms of the agreement  the company guarantees payment of any claims from ocp against the buyer upon default by the buyer and its parent company 
claims would generally be for the buyer s proportionate share of construction costs of ocp  however  other claims may arise in the normal operations of the pipeline 
accordingly  the amount of any such future claims cannot be reasonably estimated 
in connection with this guarantee  the buyer s parent company has issued a letter of credit in favor of the company up to a maximum of million  upon which the company can draw in the event it is required to perform under the guarantee agreement 
the company will be released from this guarantee when the buyer obtains a specified credit rating as stipulated under the guarantee agreement 
in addition  the company has entered into certain indemnification agreements related to title claims  environmental matters  litigation and other claims 
the company has recorded no material obligations in connection with its indemnification agreements 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of approximately million 
most of these letters of credit have been granted by financial institutions to support our international drilling commitments 
obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into purchase obligations  contracts  leases and borrowing arrangements 
the company has no debt guarantees for third parties 
as part of the company s project oriented exploration and production business  we routinely enter into contracts for certain aspects of a project  such as engineering  drilling  subsea work  etc 
these contracts are generally not unconditional obligations  thus  the company accrues for the value of work done at any point in time  a portion of which is billed to partners 
kerr mcgee s commitments and obligations as of december   are summarized in the following table millions of dollars payments due by period after type of obligation total long term debt  including current portion operating leases for nansen  boomvang and gunnison all other operating leases drilling rig commitments purchase obligations ore contracts gas purchase and transportation contracts other purchase obligations leased equipment residual value guarantees total principal amounts represent future payments and exclude the unamortized discount on issuance of million and the net fair value hedge adjustments of million 
capital spending capital expenditures are summarized as follows millions of dollars est 
exploration and production  including dry hole costs chemical other  including discontinued operations total capital spending  excluding acquisitions  totaled billion in the three year period ended december   and dividends paid totaled million in the same three year period  which compares with billion of net cash provided by operating activities during the same period 
kerr mcgee has budgeted approximately billion for its capital program in management anticipates that the capital program  dividends and debt reduction can be provided for through internally generated funds 
available borrowing capacity may be used for selective acquisitions that support the company s growth strategy or to support the company s capital expenditure program should internally generated cash flow fall short in any particular year 
exploration and production our merger with westport during provided a substantial inventory of low risk onshore exploitation opportunities  particularly in the rocky mountain area 
the company plans to capitalize on these opportunities in with a million development drilling program in the rocky mountain area  focusing primarily on the greater natural buttes and wattenberg fields 
in the southern area of the us onshore region  the westport merger also resulted in a significant increase in the company s inventory of attractive investment opportunities 
as a result  we plan to invest about million in the southern area primarily for development drilling in south texas  the mid continent permian basin and gulf coast regions 
capital expenditures onshore in the us will total about million in in the gulf of mexico  the company plans to invest million in about one third of our planned gulf of mexico capital expenditures will be investment at the constitution ticonderoga development on green canyon where first production is expected in mid other gulf of mexico investments will focus on subsea development of our atwater valley discoveries at merganser  vortex and san jacinto  as well as other satellite exploitation  infill drilling and recompletion investments around existing infrastructure 
in the north sea region  we plan capital expenditures of about million for the program for the north sea will focus primarily on infill drilling at the company operated gryphon and janice fields  as well as other non operated fields 
in the international and new ventures areas  we plan to invest about million in this investment will be focused primarily on the completion of the initial development drilling program at the cfd fields in bohai bay  china  as well as expected development costs at the cfd  cfd and cfd s fields 
including about million for investment in information systems technology  the company s capital budget for its exploration and production business totals about billion 
in addition  the company has budgeted expenditures of approximately million excluding noncash amortization of nonproducing leasehold costs for exploration expense in  including million for dry hole costs 
the company s exploration program is expected to fund approximately exploratory and appraisal wells  with emphasis on balancing risks and potential rewards in both shallow and deep waters and onshore in the us chemical capital expenditures for chemical operations are budgeted at million for process and technology improvements that increase productivity and enhance product quality will account for approximately of the capital budget 
this includes changes to the front end process at the uergingen  germany pigment facility to convert waste to a saleable product and reduce raw material costs and upgrading the oxidation line at the botlek  netherlands  pigment facility to improve throughput 
chemical has also budgeted million of additional investment in avestor for market risks the company is exposed to a variety of market risks  including credit risk  changes in oil and gas commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we address these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of insurance and derivative financial instruments 
in addition to information included in this section  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for discussions of the company s derivatives and hedging activities 
commodity price risk our oil and natural gas production is generally sold at prevailing market prices  thus exposing us to the risk of variability of our revenues and operating cash flows 
to reduce the impact of these risks on earnings and to increase the predictability of its cash flows  the company enters into certain derivative instruments that generally fix the commodity prices to be received for a portion of its future oil and gas production 
the company utilizes derivative instruments as a means of balancing cash flow requirements for debt repayment and its capital programs 
at december   commodity derivatives covered approximately of our projected oil and gas production  a decline from approximately for a lower hedge ratio allows us to benefit from increases in market prices for oil and natural gas  if they occur  but also exposes us to a greater possibility of lower realized prices  should commodity prices decline 
a risk management committee consisting of senior executives  including the ceo  develops the company s hedging strategy 
in setting hedge targets  the committee evaluates various factors  including debt management targets  liquidity  exploration and development opportunities  cash flow modeling under various price scenarios and the overall growth strategy for the company 
these and other factors are used to formulate specific hedge targets on an ongoing basis 
at december   outstanding commodity related derivatives had a net liability fair value of million 
the fair value of these derivative instruments was determined based on prices actively quoted  generally nymex and dated brent prices 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings when the associated hedged production is sold  except for gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness  which are recognized as incurred 
realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from derivative instruments not designated as hedges or that do not qualify for hedge accounting nonhedge derivatives are recognized in earnings currently 
at december   the company had after tax deferred losses of million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss associated with oil and gas cash flow hedges 
we expect to reclassify million of these losses into earnings during the next months  assuming no further changes in fair value of the contracts 
net realized oil and gas hedging losses totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the losses offset the higher oil and natural gas prices realized on the physical sale of crude oil and natural gas 
average realized oil and gas sales prices excluding and including the effect of our hedging program are presented above under results of operations by segment exploration and production 
gains and losses for hedge ineffectiveness for all periods presented were not material

the company holds certain gas basis swaps settling between and that were acquired in the merger with hs resources 
the company initially treated these gas basis swaps as nonhedge derivatives  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
in  the company designated those swaps settling in as hedges  since the basis swaps have been coupled with natural gas fixed price swaps  while the remainder settling between and will continue to be treated as nonhedge derivatives 
from time to time  the company also enters into basis swaps to help mitigate its exposure to localized natural gas indices by  in effect  converting that exposure to nymex based pricing 
to the extent such basis swaps are coupled with nymex natural gas fixed price swaps  they are accounted for as hedges  otherwise  any mark to market gains or losses are recognized currently in earnings

the company s marketing subsidiary  kerr mcgee energy services kmes purchases third party natural gas for aggregation and sale with the company s own production in the rocky mountain area 
under some of its marketing arrangements  kmes receives fixed prices for the sale of natural gas 
existing contracts for the physical delivery of gas at fixed prices have not been designated as hedges and are marked to market through earnings in accordance with fas no 
kmes has entered into natural gas swaps and basis swaps that largely offset its fixed price risk on physical contracts and lock in margins associated with the physical sales 
the gains and losses on the swaps  which also are marked to market through earnings  substantially offset the gains and losses from the fixed price physical delivery contracts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the us dollar is the functional currency for the company s international operations  except for its european chemical operations  for which the euro is the functional currency 
periodically  the company enters into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies 
certain of these contracts purchases of australian dollars and british pound sterling  and sales of euro have been designated and have qualified as cash flow hedges of the company s anticipated future cash flows related to pigment sales  capital expenditures  raw material purchases and operating costs 
these contracts generally have durations of less than three years 
changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized in earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
as discussed above  under off balance sheet arrangements  the company sells selected receivables in an accounts receivable monetization program for its pigment business 
receivables  including those denominated in foreign currency  are sold at their equivalent us dollar value at the date of monetization 
the company is collection agent and retains the risk of foreign currency rate changes between the date of sale and collection of the receivables 
under the terms of the accounts receivable monetization agreement  the company is required to enter into forward contracts for the value of the euro denominated receivables sold into the program to mitigate its foreign currency risk 
these contracts to sell foreign currency are considered nonhedge derivatives 
therefore  gains or losses on such contracts are recognized as a component of other income expense as incurred 
the company has entered into other forward contracts to sell foreign currencies  which will be collected as a result of pigment sales denominated in foreign currencies  primarily in european currencies 
these contracts have not been designated as hedges even though they do protect the company from changes in foreign currency rates 
accordingly  gains or losses on such contracts are recognized in earnings as incurred 
the following table presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual exchange rates for contracts to purchase sell foreign currencies outstanding at year end and all amounts are us dollar equivalents 
the estimated fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts is based on the year end forward exchange rates quoted by financial institutions 
at december  and  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was a net asset of million and million  respectively 
millions of dollars  notional weighted average except average contract rates amount contract rate open contracts at december  maturing in british pound sterling euro euro british pound sterling japanese yen new zealand dollar open contracts at december  maturing in british pound sterling australian dollar euro british pound sterling japanese yen new zealand dollar maturing in british pound sterling interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for the company s long term debt obligations outstanding at year end all borrowings are in us dollars 
fair there value millions of dollars after total fixed rate debt principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt principal amount weighted average interest rate includes fixed rate debt with interest rate swaps to variable rate 
principal amounts represent future payments and exclude the unamortized discount on issuance of million and the net fair value hedge adjustments of million 
interest rate derivatives in connection with the issuance of million of notes due april   the company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement in april the terms of the agreement effectively change the interest the company will pay on the debt until maturity from the fixed rate to a variable rate of libor plus 
during february  the company reviewed the composition of its outstanding debt and entered into additional interest rate swaps  converting an aggregate of million in fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
under the interest rate swaps  million of notes due october   were converted to pay a variable rate of libor plus  million of notes due october   were converted to pay a variable rate of libor plus  and million of notes due september   were converted to pay a variable rate of libor plus 
the company considers these swaps to be hedges against the change in fair value of the related debt as a result of interest rate changes 
the swaps are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
any unrealized gain or loss on the swaps is offset by a comparable gain or loss resulting from recording changes in the fair value of the related debt 
gains and losses on interest rate swaps  along with the changes in the fair value of the related debt  are reflected in interest and debt expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the critical terms of the swaps match the terms of the debt  therefore  the swaps are considered highly effective and no hedge ineffectiveness has been recognized 
at december  and  the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a net asset of million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and that ultimately affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
even so  the accounting principles used by the company generally do not impact the company s reported cash flows or liquidity 
generally  accounting rules do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve a selection of the appropriate policies for applying the basic principles 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to the company 
the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are exploratory drilling costs  crude oil and natural gas proved reserve estimation  recoverability of long lived assets  accounting for business combinations  accounting for derivative instruments  environmental remediation  tax accruals and benefit plans 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  including engineers  legal counsel  actuaries  environmental studies and historical experience in similar matters 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates as additional information becomes known 
exploratory drilling costs the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical costs and exploratory dry holes  are charged against earnings 
costs of successful exploratory wells and related production equipment are capitalized and amortized using the unit of production method on a field by field basis as oil and gas is produced 
the successful efforts method reflects the inherent unpredictability of exploring for oil and gas 
this accounting method may yield significantly different operating results than the full cost method 
under the successful efforts method  the cost of drilling an exploratory well is capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the discovery 
in the case of onshore wells and offshore wells in relatively shallow water  that determination usually can be made upon or shortly after cessation of exploratory drilling operations 
however  such determination may take longer in other areas particularly deepwater exploration and international locations depending upon  among other things  the amount of hydrocarbons discovered  the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies  the need for additional future appraisal drilling to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan  and the requirement for government sanctioning in certain international locations 
as a consequence  the company has capitalized costs associated with exploratory wells on its consolidated balance sheet at any point in time that may be charged to earnings in a future period if management determines that commercial quantities of hydrocarbons have not been discovered 
at december   the company had capitalized exploratory drilling costs of approximately million associated with ongoing exploration and or appraisal activities  primarily in the deepwater gulf of mexico  brazil  alaska and china 
additional information regarding the amount of capitalized exploratory drilling costs and changes during the last three yeas is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
proved oil and gas reserves the company s estimates of proved of oil and gas reserves are prepared by the company s engineers using available geological and reservoir data  as well as production performance data 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
even though the company s engineers are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating proved reserves  they must make a number of subjective determinations based on professional judgments in developing the company s reserve estimates 
such estimates are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions of previous estimates can occur due to  among other things  changes in reservoir performance  commodity prices  economic conditions and governmental regulations 
the company mitigates the inherent risks associated with reserve estimation through a comprehensive reserves administration process 
see note  crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas net reserves unaudited to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for additional information concerning the reserve administration process and revisions to reserve estimates in each of the last three years  including the use of independent third party engineers 
oil and gas reserve estimates impact our financial statements in two important ways 
first  proved reserves are used to calculate depreciation and depletion rates for capitalized costs associated with our proved oil and gas properties ie  depreciation and depletion expense is based on the percentage of proved reserves depleted in the current year 
if previously estimated reserves for a particular oil and gas field are revised downward  depreciation and depletion expense will increase in the future 
conversely  increased reserve estimates will cause depreciation and depletion rates to decline 
second  proved reserves are used as a component of the basis for calculating expected future cash flows for impairment test purposes under fas no 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred 
we monitor our oil and gas properties for impairment based on current period operating results and reserve revisions which may indicate that the carrying amount of a particular oil and gas field is not recoverable 
all else being equal  downward revisions of previous reserve estimates increase the likelihood that an impairment loss may be recognized 
the periodic impairment losses shown in the company s consolidated financial statements  in general terms  result from either downward reserve revisions due to changes in reservoir performance or fields that ceased production sooner than anticipated 
factors contributing to impairment losses on oil and gas properties recognized during each of the last three years are discussed above under results of operation by segment exploration and production 
impairment of assets a long lived asset is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may be greater than its future net cash flows 
such evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events  such as sales prices for oil  gas or chemicals  costs to produce these products  estimates of future oil and gas production  development costs and the timing thereof  the economic and regulatory climates  and other factors 
the need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices  downward revisions to previous oil and gas reserve estimates  increases in operating costs  and changes in environmental or abandonment regulations 
assets held for sale are reviewed for potential loss on sale when the company commits to a plan to sell and thereafter while the asset is held for sale 
losses are measured as the difference between fair value less costs to sell and the asset s carrying value 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are judgmental and subject to revision in future periods  although initial estimates usually are based on sales prices for similar assets and other valuation data 
the company cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be required for held for use assets or intangibles  or whether losses associated with held for sale properties will be recognized 
business combinations purchase price allocation in connection with a business combination  the company is required to assign the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and record deferred taxes for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
any excess of purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
most assets and liabilities are recorded in the opening balance sheet at their estimated fair values 
the company uses all available information to make these fair value determinations  including information commonly considered by the company s engineers in valuing individual oil and gas properties and sales prices for similar assets 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and loss carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
any change in deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the merger date based on information that becomes available later is recorded as an increase or decrease in goodwill 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill in connection with our acquisition of hs resources in and our merger with westport in  we recorded a total of billion of goodwill for the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company is required to assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more often as circumstances warrant 
the first step of that process is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then no impairment loss is required 
the company completed its annual impairment test associated with the goodwill recognized in the hs resources merger as of june  and no impairment was indicated 
the goodwill associated with the westport merger will not be tested for impairment until although the company cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired in the future  impairment charges may occur if the company is unable to replace the value of its depleting asset base or if other adverse events for example  lower sustained oil and gas prices reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit 
derivative instruments the company is exposed to risk from fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates 
to reduce the impact of these risks on earnings and increase the predictability of its cash flows  from time to time the company enters into certain derivative contracts  primarily swaps and collars for a portion of its oil and gas production  forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies  and interest rate swaps 
the company accounts for all its derivative instruments  in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the commodity  foreign currency and interest rate contracts are measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we have elected  under the provisions of fas no 
 to apply hedge accounting to the vast majority of our oil and gas commodity derivatives which has the effect of deferring unrealized gains and losses on these instruments in equity  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until such time as the hedged production is sold 
alternatively  we could have elected to recognize the unrealized gains and losses in current period earnings  which would have resulted in significant earnings volatility in periods preceding the actual physical sale of oil and gas 
if we had elected to apply this alternative treatment  an additional after tax unrealized loss of million would have been recognized in earnings prior to december  our chosen accounting method has no bearing on the company s liquidity or our total debt to total capitalization ratio because  in either case  stockholder s equity is reduced by the unrealized loss 
environmental remediation and other contingency reserves kerr mcgee management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities  which include the cost of investigation and remediation  are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change the company s estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contamination  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the company s estimates 
before considering reimbursements of the company s environmental costs discussed below  the company provided million  million and million for environmental remediation and restoration costs in  and  respectively  including provisions related to the company s forest products business reflected as a component of income loss from discontinued operations 
to the extent costs of investigation and remediation are recoverable from the us government under title x and under certain insurance policies and such recoveries are deemed probable  the company records a receivable 
in considering the probability of receipt  the company evaluates its historical experience with receipts  as well as its claim submission experience 
at december   estimated recoveries of environmental costs recorded in the consolidated balance sheet totaled million  of which million was received in early provisions for environmental remediation and restoration in the consolidated statement of operations were reduced by million  million and nil in  and  respectively  for estimated recoveries 
for additional information about contingencies  refer to the environmental matters section that follows and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
tax accruals the company has operations in several countries around the world and is subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries 
the estimation of the amounts of income tax to be recorded by the company involves interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations  evaluation of tax audit findings  and assessment of how the foreign taxes affect domestic taxes 
although the company s management believes its tax accruals are adequate  differences may occur in the future  depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters 
benefit plans the company provides defined benefit retirement plans and certain nonqualified benefits for employees in the us  us  germany and the netherlands and accounts for these plans in accordance with fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the various assumptions used and the attribution of the costs to periods of employee service are fundamental to the measurement of net periodic cost and pension obligations associated with the retirement plans 
the company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits and accounts for the related plans in accordance with fas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the postretirement benefit cost and obligation are also dependent on the company s assumptions used in the actuarially determined amounts 
the following are considered significant assumptions related to the company s us and foreign retirement plans and the us postretirement plan long term rate of return applies to funded plans only discount rate rate of compensation increases health care cost trend rate applies to postretirement plan only other factors considered in developing actuarial valuations include inflation rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the discussion that follows provides additional information about the assumptions made and their effect on the financial statements 
advice of independent actuaries is taken into account when forming assumptions 
us benefit plans long term rate of return in forming the assumption of the us long term rate of return  the company takes into account the expected earnings on funds already invested  earnings on contributions expected to be received in the current year  and earnings on reinvested returns 
the long term rate of return estimation methodology for us plans is based on a capital asset pricing model using historical data 
the modeling is performed and updated semi annually by a third party consultant and incorporates current portfolio allocation  historical asset class returns and an assessment of expected future performance using asset class risk factors 
based on this information  the company selected a long term rate of return assumption of as of year end and as of year end for the us pension plans 
when calculating expected return on plan assets for us pension plans  the company uses a market related value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses differences between actual return and expected return over five years 
as of january   the amount of unrecognized losses on us pension assets was million 
as these losses are recognized during future years in the market related value of assets  they will result in cumulative increases in net periodic pension cost of million in through a basis point increase decrease in the company s expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of would decrease increase net periodic pension cost for us pension plans for by million 
the change would not affect expected contributions to fund the company s us pension plans 
the net effect of the us pension plans on results of operations was expense of million 
this consisted of million expense attributable to a curtailment loss and special termination benefits and million reduction of expense due to the expected return on assets exceeding other components of net periodic pension cost 
the total expected return on assets of the us pension plans for was million  compared with an actual return of million 
during  the company s contributions to the retirement plans totaled million for certain us nonqualified plans 
discount rate the company selects a discount rate assumption as of december each year based on the average current yields on high quality long term fixed income instruments 
for us plans  the average moody s long term aa corporate bond yield and the citigroup pension liability index are used as a guide in the selection of the discount rate 
the discount rates selected for year end and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the discount rate effective december  is expected to increase net periodic pension cost by approximately million  but is not expected to affect future contributions made to the plans 
rate of compensation increases the company determines this assumption based on its long term plans for compensation increases specific to employee groups covered and expected economic conditions 
the assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases  promotions and general inflation 
the rate of was selected for both year end and health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the company chooses an initial medical trend rate and an ultimate medical trend rate  as well as the number of years it will take to move between the two rates 
the initial and the ultimate medical trend rates chosen for both and year ends were and 
in both cases  the number of years that it will take to move to the ultimate trend rate was six 
a increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each future year would increase the year end postretirement benefit obligation by million and increase the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement expense by million 
foreign benefit plans long term rate of return our assumption of the long term rate of return for the uk and the netherlands plans is based on the advice of the third party consultants  considering portfolio mix and the rates of return on local government and corporate bonds 
the long term rates of return chosen as of year end and were and  respectively  for the uk plan 
for the netherlands plan  the long term rate of return assumption was at year end and at year end discount rate for foreign plans  the company bases the estimates on local corporate bond index rates 
the discount rates selected for the foreign plans at december  ranged from to 
the respective rates for year end ranged from to 
rate of compensation increases consistent with the us plans  the company determines this assumption based on its long term plans for compensation increases specific to employee groups covered 
the assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases  promotions and general inflation 
the rates of compensation increases for the foreign retirement plans ranged from at year end and from at year end the above description of the company s critical accounting policies is not intended to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties considered and estimates made by management in applying accounting principles and policies 
results may vary significantly if different policies were used or required and if new or different information becomes known to management 
environmental matters the company s affiliates are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the united states and in the foreign countries in which they operate 
under these laws  the company s affiliates are or may be required to obtain or maintain permits and or licenses in connection with their operations 
in addition  under these laws  the company s affiliates are or may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of certain chemical  petroleum  low level radioactive and other substances at various sites 
environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent  and compliance costs are significant and will continue to be significant in the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
sites at which the company s affiliates have environmental responsibilities include sites that have been designated as superfund sites by the us environmental protection agency epa pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla  as amended  and that are included on the national priority list npl 
as of december   the company s affiliates had received notices that they had been named potentially responsible parties prp with respect to existing epa superfund sites on the npl that require remediation 
the company does not consider the number of sites for which its affiliates have been named a prp to be the determining factor when considering the company s overall environmental liability 
decommissioning and remediation obligations  and the attendant costs  vary substantially from site to site and depend on unique site characteristics  available technology and the regulatory requirements applicable to each site 
additionally  the company s affiliates may share liability at some sites with numerous other prps  and the law currently imposes joint and several liability on all prps under cercla 
the company s affiliates are also obligated to perform or have performed remediation or remedial investigations and feasibility studies at sites that have not been designated as superfund sites by epa 
such work is frequently undertaken pursuant to consent orders or other agreements 
current businesses the company s oil and gas affiliates are subject to numerous international  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection 
in the united states  these include the federal water pollution control act  commonly known as the clean water act  the clean air act and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration  drilling and production activities  the release of emissions into the atmosphere  and the discharge and disposition of waste materials 
environmental laws and regulations also govern offshore oil and gas operations  the implementation of spill prevention plans  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites  and the remediation and monitoring of contaminated sites 
the company s chemical affiliates are subject to a broad array of international  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including the clean water act  the clean air act  cercla and rcra 
these laws require the company s affiliates to undertake various activities to reduce air emissions  eliminate the generation of hazardous waste  decrease the volume of wastewater discharges and increase the efficiency of energy use 
discontinued businesses the company s affiliates historically have held interests in various businesses in which they are no longer engaged or which they intend to exit 
such businesses include the refining and marketing of oil and gas and associated petroleum products  the mining and processing of uranium and thorium  the production of ammonium perchlorate  the treatment of forest products and other activities 
although the company s affiliates are no longer engaged in certain businesses  residual obligations may still exist  including obligations related to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  including the clean water act  the clean air act  cercla and rcra 
these laws and regulations require company affiliates to undertake remedial measures at sites of current or former operations or at sites where waste was disposed 
for example  company affiliates are required to conduct decommissioning and environmental remediation at certain refineries  distribution facilities and service stations they owned and or operated before exiting the refining and marketing business in company affiliates also are required to conduct decommissioning and remediation activities at sites where they were involved in the exploration  production  processing and or sale of uranium or thorium and at sites where they were involved in the production and sale of ammonium perchlorate 
additionally  the company s chemical affiliate is decommissioning and remediating its wood treatment facilities as part of its exit from the forest products business 
environmental costs expenditures for environmental protection and cleanup for each of the last three years and for the three year period ended december   are as follows millions of dollars total charges to environmental reserves recurring expenses capital expenditures total in addition to past expenditures  reserves have been established for the remediation and restoration of active and inactive sites where it is probable that future costs will be incurred and the liability is reasonably estimable 
for environmental sites  the company considers a variety of matters when setting reserves  including the stage of investigation  whether epa or another relevant agency has ordered action or quantified cost  whether the company has received an order to conduct work  whether the company participates as a prp in the remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs process and  if so  how far the ri fs has progressed  the status of the record of decision by the relevant agency  the status of site characterization  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  the number and financial condition of other potential prps  and whether the company reasonably can evaluate costs based upon a remedial design and or engineering plan 
after the remediation work has begun  additional accruals or adjustments to costs may be made based on any number of developments  including revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contamination  inability to implement a planned engineering design or to use planned technologies and excavation methods  changes in costs of labor  equipment and or technology  any additional or updated engineering and other studies  and weather conditions 
as of december   the company s financial reserves for all active and inactive sites totaled million 
this includes million added in for active and inactive sites 
in the consolidated balance sheet  million of the total reserve is classified as noncurrent liabilities other  and the remaining million is included in accrued liabilities 
management believes that currently the company has reserved adequately for the reasonably estimable costs of known environmental contingencies 
however  additional reserves may be required in the future due to the previously noted uncertainties 
additionally  there may be other sites where the company has potential liability for environmental related matters but for which the company does not have sufficient information to determine that the liability is probable and or reasonably estimable 
the company has not established reserves for such sites 
the following table reflects the company s portion of the known estimated costs of investigation and or remediation that are probable and estimable 
the table summarizes epa superfund npl sites where the company and or its affiliates have been notified it is a prp under cercla and other sites for which the company had financial reserves recorded at year end in the table  aggregated information is presented for certain sites that are individually not significant each has a remaining reserve balance of less than million

new revised accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb has proposed an amendment to statement no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies fas no 
that may change the way oil and gas producers account for deferred exploratory drilling costs 
under the current rules  there is a presumption that all exploratory drilling costs will be expensed within one year following completion of drilling if proved reserves have not been recorded  except for costs related to areas where additional exploration wells are necessary to justify development plans and such additional wells are under way or firmly planned for the near future 
application of fas no 
to the facts and circumstances commonly faced by oil and gas producers in today s exploration and development environment particularly in deepwater and international areas has become a concern for the industry and there are diverse views in practice 
for example  in the case of deepwater discoveries  additional appraisal wells are almost never under way or firmly planned when the drilling rig is released due to the time required to assess the initial discovery well  update geologic models  and plan appraisal well locations in an extremely high cost drilling environment 
the new standard would relax the one year limitation  so long as oil and gas reserves have been discovered and an enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
the fasb staff has developed indicators to help determine whether sufficient progress is being made 
the company believes the adoption of the proposed amendment once finalized will have no impact on its consolidated financial statements 
additional information related to exploratory drilling costs is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k

 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provisions within the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
fsp no 
provides guidance with respect to reporting the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act on an enterprise s income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october   and provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by a company s board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
fsp no 
states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
the company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact of the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp no 
 the company has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
additional disclosures related to the status of our evaluation of the jobs act repatriation provisions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k

 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  indicating that this deduction  which will be available to the company in  should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with the provisions of fas no

fas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under fas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt fas no 
r in the third quarter of under fas no 
r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the permitted transition methods include either retrospective or prospective adoption 
under the retrospective method of adoption  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption modified retrospective method or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested share based compensation awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas no 
r  while the retrospective methods would record compensation expense for all unvested share based compensation awards beginning with the first period presented 
the company is currently evaluating the requirements of fas no 
r and expects to adopt this standard no later than july  using either the prospective or the modified retrospective method of adoption 
the company expects that the effect of adoption will not have a material effect on our financial condition and cash flows  and that the effect on our results of operations will be comparable to the current pro forma disclosures under fas no
