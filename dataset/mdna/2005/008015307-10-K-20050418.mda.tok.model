cautionary statement and additional trends and uncertainties 
this section cautions on the basis of certain forward looking statements which are susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances and discusses important trends and uncertainties that may impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
overview the trend in the aviation industry is toward digital cockpits as the industry moves away from mechanical cockpit instrumentation that was the foundation of the company 
the company has made considerable progress in developing electronic instrumentation that is integrated into cockpit flight management systems to replace mechanical instrumentation that the company had previously offered to its customers 
the company is currently developing digital display instrumentation to further replace mechanical instrumentation in its product line to broaden its offering to customers who may want to upgrade their cockpits 
the company has increased its research and development expenditures to facilitate this upgrade in its product line as it anticipates further movement toward digital cockpits in the aviation industry  positioning itself in a market niche where it has the ability to offer both digital and mechanical instrumentation 
while the company believes that this strategy strengthens its position in the industry  it cannot guarantee that this strategy will be successful 
an additional trend in the aviation industry is toward system integration by the oems 
while the company currently maintains direct relationships with oems  it anticipates that oem suppliers will need to align themselves with integrators in order to preserve its position on future aircraft platforms 
the company also has significant business tied to military 
as a consequence  the company s business can fluctuate depending on government spending on military programs for which the company supplies its products 
while the company has been successful in obtaining contracts to supply military needs in recent years  changes in government spending could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s future military business 
likewise  changes in growth in the commercial sector of the aviation industry can have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s future business 
while the company has invested heavily in product development for both funded and unfunded programs  oem requirements may change such that additional product development efforts will be necessary to maintain or increase the company s revenue in the industry 
such changes in requirements could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s future commercial business 
as the company endeavors to increase its international presence  its exposure to international economic changes as well as foreign currency risk may increase 
while the company may manage this exposure with appropriate resources  it cannot guarantee that such risks will be fully mitigated 
results of operations revenues revenues decreased  or  to  for fiscal year  from  for fiscal year this decrease was largely driven by a decrease in revenue of approximately  for the joint strike fighter jsf program that resulted from slower progress on completing and testing the probe design 
precision components revenue decreased approximately  as the phase out of that business was completed 
these decreases in revenue were partially offset by increases in volume for core instrument revenues of approximately  and price changes of approximately  as the company achieved further market penetration for recently introduced products and negotiated more favorable terms 
revenues increased  or  to  for fiscal year  from  for fiscal year this growth was driven by an increase in revenue of  for the joint strike fighter program  as well as an increase in core instrument sales of approximately  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in precision component revenue of approximately  cost of sales cost of sales increased  or  to  or of revenues  for fiscal year from  or of revenues  for fiscal year this increase in cost was primarily due to lower margins on the jsf development program  as the rate of growth in jsf program costs incurred exceeded the rate of growth in revenues recognized 
in addition  further discussions and negotiations with the jsf program s customer in january resulted in the definition of additional design work and testing to continue with progress on the probe design 
the additional design work and testing has resulted in a revision to the company s estimate at completion for the jsf project  and the company now estimates that the jsf project will result in an overall loss of approximately  at completion 
the company has recognized this loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal year cost of sales increased  or  to  or of revenues  for fiscal year from  or of revenues  for fiscal year this increase in cost was primarily due to lower margins on the jsf development program  as approximately  of costs were incurred for what the company believes were changes on scope and for which no additional revenue has yet been recognized 
in addition  the rate of growth in jsf program costs exceeded the rate of growth in jsf revenues because additional testing was required during certain aspects of the development cycle 
also  a shift in product mix where instrumentation revenues increased and represented a larger percentage of volume than in fiscal year while revenues for repairs and spare parts remained relatively the same put downward pressure on gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased  or  to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenue for fiscal year the decrease was attributable to substantial reductions in one time charges for professional fees that were partially offset by the company s investment at clearwater instruments of approximately  in product development for the cessna mustang program and the expansion of its engineering capability  increases in corporate governance related expenses of approximately  as well as increases in travel of approximately  for international business development 
sg a expense increased  or  to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenues for fiscal year the increase in sg a expense was attributable to one time charges for auditing and legal fees related to the company s restatement of results of approximately  a retirement contract of approximately  and a consulting arrangement with the company s former chairman and chief executive officer of approximately  these one time charges were partially offset by reductions in engineering costs of approximately  that are largely due to the redeployment of engineering staff to the f program where the engineering costs are absorbed in cost of sales  a reduction in compensation and benefits in general and administrative expense of approximately  and a reduction in consulting fees of approximately  interest expense net interest expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal year from net interest expense of  in fiscal year the net interest expense decrease was due to lower average outstanding debt during the year 
net interest expense decreased  or to  in fiscal year from net interest expense of  in fiscal year the net interest expense decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt during the year and lower interest rates 
other income expense other income expense increased  to  in fiscal year from other income expense of  in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the receipt of an insurance settlement of approximately  in may related to the june fire in the machine shop at the company s clearwater instruments location as well as the receipt of net proceeds of approximately  related to the sale of the company s engine vibration monitoring system evms product line inventory in february the sales price of the evms product line was approximately  and the costs related to this sale included inventory that was sold of approximately  inventory that was made obsolete by the sale of approximately  and legal fees of approximately  the increases in other income  net were partially offset by the recognition of a liability of approximately  related to the anticipated settlement of the company s class action litigation 
a summary of the evms sale is as follows fiscal year ended january  sale proceeds inventory sold obsolete inventory due to the sale legal fees miscellaneous income other income expense decreased  to  in fiscal year from other income expense  in fiscal year the decrease was primarily related to the one time litigation settlement in fiscal year and was partially offset by foreign exchange gains on british pound transactions 
income tax expense income tax expense was a benefit of  for fiscal year as compared to a benefit of  for fiscal year the income tax obligations that arise from pretax income for fiscal year are offset by the change in the deferred tax allowance recognized in fiscal year as well as the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards 
although the company has recorded substantial deferred tax assets  the company anticipates that future earnings during the three fiscal years succeeding the fiscal year will be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax benefits 
consequently  the company has reduced its deferred tax valuation allowance from approximately  as of january  to as of january  the effective tax rate increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a substantial increase in income before taxes and a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance in fiscal year when compared to the impact of the change in the deferred tax valuation allowance recognized in fiscal year income tax expense was a benefit of  for fiscal year as compared to an income tax benefit of  for fiscal year the income tax obligations that arise from pretax income for fiscal year are offset by the reversal of a portion of the deferred tax valuation allowance that had been previously recognized  as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset benefits will be realized in future periods 
the effective rate decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the reversal of a portion of the deferred tax valuation allowance that had been previously recognized 
income net income increased  or to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from  or of revenue  for fiscal year earnings per share increased to for fiscal year from in fiscal year net income decreased  to  or of revenue  for fiscal year from net income of  or of revenue  for fiscal year earnings per share decreased to for fiscal year from earnings per share of in fiscal year inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  the company cannot predict the future effects of inflation 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal year as compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal year the reduction was primarily attributable to a substantial year over year decrease in accounts payable as the company was able to bring its accounts to current status following a year of substantial one time expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by improvements in cash flows from net income net of deferred income tax effects of approximately  accounts receivable of approximately  and income taxes receivable and payable of approximately  cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal year  compared to  for fiscal year the company incurred substantial costs for professional services in fiscal year  and a significant portion remained in accounts payable at january   resulting in a provision of cash of approximately  in addition  a large payment that was accrued as an account payable but was paid subsequent to january  resulted in a provision of cash of approximately  the ramp up of production for the a government contract as well as the shipment of finished goods that were held at january  contributed to the cash provided by the decline in inventory of approximately  also  a reduction in accrued liabilities due to the payment of professional fees that were accrued at january  contributed to cash used due to a decline in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately  cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to a machine tool purchase for production at avionics of approximately  that was offset by the proceeds from the sale of property of approximately  cash used in investing activities was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to the deferral of capital investment activity 
cash used in financing activities was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to cash used of  in fiscal year this reduction in cash usage was primarily due to repayments of a portion of the company s long term debt as well as the full repayment of the company s revolving credit facility 
although unused as of january   the revolving credit facility remains fully available for the company s short term financing needs 
cash used in financing activities was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to cash used of  in fiscal year this decrease in cash usage was primarily due to lower debt repayment obligations as well as the absence of treasury stock purchases 
to accommodate fluctuation in cash flow  the company has a million revolving credit facility with wachovia bank  na wachovia as described in the following paragraph  which is set to expire in june as of january   the company was not utilizing this facility 
note to the financial statements provides details of the company s refinancing of its principal debt with wachovia on february  the wachovia refinancing 
the new debt facilities provided by the wachovia refinancing consist of a  term loan  a  revolving credit facility and a  term loan 
the proceeds from the wachovia refinancing were used to repay all of the company s debt obligations to first commercial bank and suntrust bank na the redemption of the company s debt to first commercial bank and suntrust bank  na was at stated value  and therefore resulted in no gain or loss 
the company s long term debt agreements with wachovia contain certain financial and other restrictive covenants  including the requirement to maintain i at all times  a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth that does not exceed to and ii at the end of each fiscal quarter  a cash flow coverage ratio with regard to the ratio of cash flow to the debt service of at least to 
the wachovia loan agreement subjects the company to a number of additional covenants that  among other things  require the company to obtain consent from the lender prior to making a material change of management  prior to making a guarantee of or otherwise becoming responsible for obligations of any other person or entity or assuming or becoming liable for any debt  contingent or direct  in excess of  the company is also required to provide the wachovia with its interim quarterly financial statements within days of the close of each fiscal quarter and its annual financial statements within days of the close of each fiscal year 
as of january   the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants 
the company had been in breach of certain covenants and other provisions of the documents related to its debt obligations to both suntrust bank na and first commercial bank 
the company had previously obtained written waivers for breaches of covenant violations that had occurred during fiscal year as of january   the company was still in violation of certain financial covenants and had obtained an extension of its debt obligations to first commercial bank to april   however the debt obligations to both suntrust bank na and first commercial bank were subsequently repaid out of the wachovia refinancing proceeds  in february the company s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and compliance with covenants in fiscal year and beyond is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results 
failure to achieve expected operating results and compliance with covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and operations in fiscal year and beyond  and could require implementation of further measures  including deferring planned capital expenditures  reducing discretionary spending  and  if necessary  selling assets 
in addition  future capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including research and development  expansion of products lines  and other factors 
management believes that cash and cash equivalents  together with the company s cash flow from operations and current borrowing arrangements  will provide for these necessary capital expenditures 
furthermore  the company may develop and introduce new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  invest or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments  which would require additional resources 
as shown in the table below  as of january   there are liquidation payments that were due with respect to long term debt and other contractual obligations in fiscal year and beyond payments due by period contractual obligations less than after total one year years years years purchase commitments long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations the long term debt carries an interest obligation equal to the one month libor interest rate plus basis points 
as of january   the annualized amount of interest for the january  long term debt balance of approximately  would be approximately  the company s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity in fiscal year and beyond is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results and renewing its credit line 
the company s new credit facilities with wachovia  as discussed above  include a million credit line that is set to expire on june  failure to renew that line of credit or failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our operations in fiscal year  and could require us to consider further measures  including deferring planned capital expenditures  reducing discretionary spending and  if necessary  selling assets 
acquisitions currently  the company has no arrangements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions 
nevertheless  the company continues to monitor acquisition opportunities 
the company s ability to consummate any acquisitions  including a merger with another entity  is substantially limited by covenants in the company s long term debt documents 
environmental matters in accordance with a consent agreement with the department of environmental protection signed by the company in  the company s environmental consultant developed an interim remedial action plan the remedial plan to contain and remediate certain soil and groundwater contamination that had been discovered at the company s clearwater  florida location 
the contamination was discovered after a series of site investigations that revealed impacts to both shallow soils and groundwater that may have resulted from the accidental loss of solvents and metalworking fluids as well as activities from neighboring property over a period of years or more 
although the exact cause of the contamination has never been ascertained  the company nonetheless accepted responsibility for remediating the pollutants that were discovered on its property 
during  the company recorded a provision of approximately  related to the estimated costs to be incurred under the remedial plan 
as of january   the company had utilized all amounts originally recorded in other accrued expenses  and the remediation phase of the remedial plan had been completed 
during the third quarter of  management determined the post remediation monitoring expense related to the environmental cleanup of would cost approximately  this amount was accrued and expensed during the third quarter of as of january   all existing reserve balances had been utilized 
based upon an assessment by the company s environmental consultants  the company s management has calculated the company s expected future expense for post remediation monitoring expense and has established a reserve of  for such expense  including a fiscal year addition of  to the prior reserve of  the company is now in a monitoring only stage of the remediation where periodic measurements are taken by environmental consultants to determine the effectiveness of the remediation 
the existing reserve contemplates the remaining expected expenses  based upon advice from the company s environmental consultants  as of january  the following table is a recap of the financial impact of the company s environmental activities year ended january  beginning reserve balance costs incurred replenish reserve for costs incurred increase in estimate ending reserve balance critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of those financial statements and this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure items  including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and as a result of trends and uncertainties identified above under results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and below under cautionary statement and additional trends and uncertainties 
further  such differences could be material 
set forth below is a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies 
the company considers critical accounting policies to be those i that require the company to make estimates that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  ii for which a different estimate which could have been made would have a material impact on the company s financial statements  iii that are the most important and pervasive policies utilized  and iv that are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
additionally  the policies discussed below are critical to an understanding of the financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are highly uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on business operations is discussed throughout this md a where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the company manufactures most of its products on a build to order basis and ships products upon completion 
the company has a policy of strict adherence to the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab in order to accurately state its revenues in each accounting period 
for certain situations  some judgment is required  but most sales have clear revenue recognition criteria 
revenue sources for product sales are largely from sales to commercial and government customers 
the majority of customer sales terms are fob origin  although some customer terms are fob destination 
for those customers where terms are origin  revenue is generally recognized upon shipment  unless additional prevailing factors would not be in accordance with the revenue recognition requirements of sab for those customers whose terms are destination  revenue is generally not recognized until goods arrive at the customers premises and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the company experiences a certain degree of sales returns that varies over time 
generally such returns occur within no more than days after shipment by the company to its customers 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas revenue recognition when right of return exists  the company is able to make a reasonable estimation of expected sales returns based upon history and as contemplated by the requirements of sfas for example  sales returns may occur if delivery schedules are changed by customers after products have shipped or if products are received by customers but do not meet specifications 
in such cases  customers may choose to return products to the company 
absent such circumstances  customers do not have a right to return products if the company has met all contractual obligations 
the company has established a sales return reserve that approximates an expect ed level of sales returns over a day period and  as of january   that reserve is  from time to time  the company will jointly develop products with its customers for future applications 
in such circumstances  the company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for the contract 
this method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts 
the percentage of completion contract costs include direct labor  material  subcontracting costs  test facilities  and other indirect costs as allocated 
other operating costs are charged to expense as incurred 
during fiscal  the company secured one long term fixed price contract for the development of instrumentation for the jsf program 
costs and estimated earnings on this contract as of the years ended january  and are as follows costs incurred to date estimated earnings loss less billings to date costs and estimated profits in excess of billings in january  after further discussions with the company s customer for the jsf program that culminated in requirements for design changes in the multifunction probe that the company is designing for the jsf  the company has revised its estimate at completion for the jsf program 
the estimated costs of the project increased by approximately  and  as a result  estimated total program costs exceed estimated program revenues by approximately  the company has recognized this loss in its financial statements for the fiscal year ended january  the jsf program is a customer funded product development program that is presently expected to generate total project revenues of approximately  as of january   based on project progress  the company has recognized revenues of approximately  for the jsf project 
the jsf program represents a significant investment in the company s future product development capabilities 
while company management is expending considerable effort to control costs and complete the development process on schedule  the key benefit to the program is the substantial revenue that the company will earn if it is awarded the production contract for the jsf that is expected to follow the conclusion of the development program 
occasionally the company enters into research and development contracts with customers 
the company accounts for such contracts on the basis of the lesser of non refundable cash versus percentage of completion 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses the company continuously evaluates its customers and provides reserves for anticipated credit losses as soon as collection becomes compromised 
the company does maintain a limited reserve in anticipation that smaller accounts may become a collection issue  which occurs from time to time based on historical experience 
however  most of the company s customers are financially sound and the company s history of bad debts is relatively low 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financia l health of specific customers 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory losses and residual value losses the company values inventory at the lower of cost using a method that approximates the first in  first out method or net realizable value 
reviews of inventory quantities on hand have been conducted to determine if usage or sales history supports maintaining inventory values at full cost or if it has instead become necessary to record a provision for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although the company endeavors to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and consequently reported operating results 
work in process inventories management employs certain methods to estimate the value of work in process inventories for financial reporting purposes 
company practice has been to conduct cycle counts of inventory at its clearwater  florida  earlysville  virginia and wichita  kansas operations throughout the year 
generally  for items that are in process at the end of a fiscal year  management will make an estimate during the cycle counting process regarding the percentage of completion of such items in order to accurately reflect costs incurred to date on the production of the items that are still in process 
these estimates are affected by the nature of the operation at which the items are located at the time a physical inventory is conducted  and are subject to judgment 
this practice was employed for the fiscal years ended january  and manufacturing overhead cost application the company establishes its inventoriable cost of manufacturing overhead by calculating its overhead costs as a percentage of direct labor and applying that percentage to direct labor that has been charged to inventory on a twelve month rolling average basis 
this application percentage is reviewed at least quarterly and is adjusted at least annually 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against the future benefit of deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits associated with the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
long lived assets the useful lives of property  plant and equipment for purposes of computing depreciation are land improvements years buildings and improvements years machinery and equipment years patterns  dies  and tools years furniture and fixtures years management periodically evaluates long lived assets for potential impairment and will record an impairment charge whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
as of january  and  management does not believe that any assets are impaired 
the company will capitalize production costs for computer software that is to be utilized as an integral part of a product when both a technological feasibility is established for the software and b all research and development activities for the other components of the product have been completed 
amortization is charged to expense at the greater of the expected unit sales versus units sold or the straight line method for a period of three years from the date the product becomes available for general release to customers 
other accounts affected by management estimates from time to time  management will utilize estimates when preparing the financial statements of the company 
such areas include amortization and other accruals 
the company has established a provision for warranty claims in anticipation of a certain degree of warranty activity  which generally is a minimal expense 
this provision is based upon recent warranty experience 
the company s warranty experience is as follows for the year ended january  beginning reserve balance costs incurred replenish reserve for costs incurred increase in estimate ending reserve balance the following table summarizes significant areas which require management estimates for the year ended january  allowance for doubtful accounts reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory warranty reserve environmental reserve reserve for sales returns depreciation amortization deferred tax valuation allowance in addition to the items noted in the above table  management uses estimates in calculating the percentage of completion of the jsf program 
these estimates have a significant impact on costs and estimated profits in excess of billings included in the company s consolidated balance sheets

cautionary statement and additional trends and uncertainties as set forth in part i of this annual report on form k  the md a contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the company and the industry in which it operates 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
accordingly  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
additionally  past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
in particular  the company s results of operations  revenue  liquidity and capital resources may be impacted materially and unfavorably by a number of risk factors  trends and uncertainties 
set forth below are some of the risk factors  trends and uncertainties which we believe could have a material and unfavorable impact on the company s results of operations  revenue  liquidity  capital resources and any investment in the company 
additional risk factors  trends and uncertainties are discussed above 
the following list is not exhaustive  and other factors which are not presently apparent to us also may have a material and unfavorable impact 
risks associated with dependence on the aviation industry the company s principal business is in the aviation industry 
this industry is primarily affected by the general state of the economy in the commercial sector and defense budgets of the us and foreign governments in the military sector 
the company s focus in the commercial sector is in the business jet market 
in the military sector  the levels of defense spending as well as the status of international conflicts are expected to have a direct impact on the company s business 
while the company expects increases in homeland security spending to benefit fixed wing and helicopter aircraft  the company cannot guarantee that such increased levels of spending will actually occur nor that such increases will be to the benefit of the company 
although we have worked to offset the potentially negative impact of such factors  the outbreak or escalation of terrorist attacks or international hostilities could cause deterioration in the commercial and business aircraft market 
risks associated with dependence on us government contracts our dependence on revenue from us government contracts subjects us to a number of risks  including the risk that we may not be successful in bidding for future contracts and the risk that us government funding for these contracts may be delayed or diverted to other uses 
we perform work on a number of contracts with the department of defense and other agencies and departments of the us government 
sales under contracts with the us government as a whole  including sales under contracts with the department of defense  as prime contractor or subcontractor  represented approximately of our total revenue for fiscal year and of our total revenue for fiscal year government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations 
congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 
as a result  at the beginning of a major program  a contract is typically only partially funded  and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by congress for future fiscal years 
while the overall us military budget declined in real dollars from the mid s through the early s  as a result of the september th terrorist attacks and given the current middle east and global situation  us defense spending has increased and is expected to increase over the next several years 
increased defense spending does not necessarily correlate to increased business for the company  because not all the programs in which the company participates or has current capabilities may be earmarked for increased funding 
most of our us government contracts are subject to termination by the us government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor 
termination for convenience provisions permit only the recovery of costs incurred or committed  settlement expenses  and profit on work completed prior to termination 
termination for default imposes liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source 
a substantial majority of our us government contracts are fixed price type contracts 
a majority of these contracts are for mature products and costs are well established 
however  some contracts include costs associated with product development 
these types of contracts bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price 
we  like other us government contractors  are subject to various audits  reviews and investigations including private party whistleblower lawsuits relating to our compliance with federal and state laws 
in addition  we have a compliance program designed to surface issues that may lead to voluntary disclosures to the us government 
generally  claims arising out of these us government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation 
however  should a business unit or division of the company involved in a government contract be charged with violation of law  or should the us government determine that the unit or division is not a presently responsible contractor  that unit or division  and conceivably the company as a whole  could be temporarily suspended or  in the event of a conviction  could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new us government contracts or government approved subcontracts 
in addition  we could expend substantial amounts in defending against such charges and in damages  fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements 
if aerosonic were to be debarred from us government defense contracts  it would have a material adverse effect on aerosonic s results of operations  revenue  liquidity and capital resources 
risks associated with aviation industry regulations the aerospace industry is heavily regulated and failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could reduce our sales  or require us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the federal aviation administration the faa prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft components  including virtually all of our products 
comparable agencies  such as the uk civil aviation authority and the japanese civil aviation board  regulate these matters in other countries 
if we fail to obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a license previously granted  the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained or renewed 
in addition  designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be both expensive and time consuming 
from time to time the faa proposes new regulations 
these new regulations generally cause an increase in costs to comply with these regulations 
to the extent the faa implements rule changes in the future  we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance 
the challenge to compete against larger well established companies we compete with numerous established companies 
some of these companies have significantly greater financial  technological and marketing resources 
our ability to be an effective competitor will depend in large part on our success in causing our products to be selected for installation in new aircraft  including next generation aircraft  and in avoiding product obsolescence 
risks associated with rapid technological change and products that are subject to obsolescence as a result thereof our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis 
successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors  including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements  changes in technology and industry standards  our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors  and market acceptance 
the markets for a number of our products and services are generally characterized by rapid technological development  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements 
a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
currently accepted industry standards are also subject to change  which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services 
in order to remain competitive  we must make substantial investments in research and development to develop new and enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities 
we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions 
our ability to raise additional capital may depend on a variety of factors  some of which will not be within our control  including investor perceptions of us  our businesses and the industries in which we operate  and general economic conditions 
we may be unable to successfully raise additional capital  if needed 
risks related to the company s handling and use of hazardous substances and related environmental matters our operations require the handling and use of hazardous substances  and we are subject to federal  state and local laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  the protection of the environment and the use or cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes 
from time to time  our operations could result in violations under such environmental laws  including spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
we may incur substantial costs or experience interruptions in our operations for actual or alleged violations or compliance requirements arising under environmental laws 
additionally  we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties 
in the event of a major incident  we could incur material costs or experience interruption in our operations as a result of addressing the incident and implementing measures to prevent such incidents in the fu ture  as well as potential litigation that could arise from such an incident 
in addition  we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future environmental laws 
based on available information  we are aware of only one existing environmental matter  which is discussed above under item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
we are subject to significant restrictive operational and financial covenants 
as noted above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company successfully refinanced its long term debt instruments in february the new facilities contain fewer restrictive financial covenants than the preceding debt instruments  but do contain covenants that restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends and require the company to obtain consent or a waiver prior to taking certain other corporate actions  including the disposition of assets  mergers and changes in corporate management 
among other things  these covenants may prevent the company from consummating potential dispositions or acquisitions  and may deter or prevent an acquisition or merger of the company 
we are subject to the risks associated with international sales 
during fiscal year  international sales accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
we anticipate that future international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
risks associated with these sales include political and economic instability  export controls  changes in legal and regulatory requirements  us and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products  changes in tax laws and tariffs  convertibility and transferability of international currencies  and exchange rate fluctuations 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position 
attracting and retaining key personnel is an essential element of our future success our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
recruiting and retaining skilled technical personnel is highly competitive 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with terrorism and world conflict united states and global responses to the middle east conflict  terrorism  perceived nuclear  biological and chemical threats and other global crises increase uncertainties with respect to us and other business and financial markets 
several factors associated  directly or indirectly  with the middle east conflict  terrorism  perceived nuclear  biological and chemical threats and other global crises and responses thereto  may adversely affect the company 
while some of our products that are sold to the us government may experience greater demand as a result of increased us government defense spending  various responses could realign us government programs and affect the composition  funding or timing of our government programs 
us government spending could shift to defense programs in which we do participate 
the company has contracts with governments of certain states located in the middle east 
the instability in that region  as well as us  local or global responses to potentially controversial policies or actions adopted or taken by such governments  may negatively impact those contracts 
the company has contracts with the government of south korea 
recent actions and perceived provocations by the government of north korea have resulted in increased concern regarding the stability of the korean armistice 
additionally  reports indicate that north korea may be moving to produce and test nuclear weapons or otherwise provoke the us and international community 
resulting instability on the korean peninsula  and any us  local or global responses to perceived provocations by the government of north korea  could impact the company s contracts with south korea 
while an escalation of hostilities on the korean peninsula might lead to increased military spending by south korea  there is no certainty that the company s contracts with south korea would benefit 
additionally  it is possible that any instability in that region could have a negative impact on the company s contracts 
risks associated with significant stock price fluctuations the market price of our common stock ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share during the week period ended february  the accounting misstatements  resulting restatements  the contributing factors that led to the restatements and the sec investigation discussed herein  in the attached financial statements  and in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january  might continue to have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
the average daily trading volume in our common stock on the american stock exchange amex for the six month period ended february  was approximately  shares per day and the daily trading volume in our common stock during the same period ranged from a low of zero shares traded to a high of  shares traded 
other factors and general market conditions that could affect our stock price are our quarterly operating results and variations therein  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  changes in our business  changes in the market s perception of our business  changes in the businesses  earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors or customers  changes in the outlook for the aviation industry  changes in general market or economic conditions unrelated to our performance  changes in the legislative or regulatory environment  changes in us defense spending or appropriations  increased military or homeland defense activities  an outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities  terrorist attacks  sales of significant blocks of our common stock  our ability to successfully renew our line of credit that is set to expire in june  and the outcome of the pending securities class action litigation and the proposed settlement of that litigation 
additionally  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies  including companies in our industry 
the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 
when a stock s price continues to fluctuate significantly over a sustained period  the risk of loss  including a total loss  is increased 
risks associated with the sec investigation  current shareholder litigation and derivative suit the company was the subject of a formal order of investigation issued by the us securities and exchange commission the sec on may  with respect to potential violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the accounting misstatements and contributing causes disclosed by the company in press releases dated march and may  and further discussed in the company s annual report for the fiscal year ended january  and the subsequent quarterly reports on form q  which the company brought to the attention of the sec in conjunction with management s internal investigation  and other potential issues 
the company received a letter from the sec dated october  advising the company that the sec investigation has been terminated as to the company and that no enforcement action has been recommended to the commission as to the company 
the company is a defendant in securities class action lawsuits brought by several plaintiffs  as discussed above under item legal proceedings securities class action litigation 
as described in note to the financial statements  on april   the company and the other named defendants in the litigation filed a notice of settlement with the court  confirming that all parties had executed a memorandum of understanding mou with the plaintiffs to settle the litigation 
the mou provides for a payment by or on behalf of the defendants to the plaintiffs of approximately million 
of this amount  the company is obligated to pay  which has been accrued at january  the balance of the settlement is expected to be paid by zurich american insurance company on behalf of the company and the individual defendants under the company s directors and officers insurance policy  and by pricewaterhousecoopers llp 
the settlement is subject to preliminary and final court approval  as well as other conditions that may cause the settlement not to be consummated 
on april   aerosonic became aware of a derivative complaint filed on march  in the circuit court of hillsborough county  florida  by matilda franzitta  asserting that she is a shareholder acting on behalf of the company  which is a nominal defendant  and naming as defendants certain present and past officers  directors and employees  some of whom also were named as defendants in the pending federal securities class action litigation  and the company s former registered independent certified public accounting firm and that firm s partner in charge of the company s audit 
the complaint alleges a breaches of fiduciary duties and aiding and abetting such breaches by the present and former directors  officers  and employees named as defendants  for an asserted relevant period which appears to begin sometime in and continues to the present time  and b breaches of contr act  professional negligence  and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties  by the company s former auditor during the asserted relevant period  and that firm s partner in charge of the company s audit during most of that time 
the company is in the process of evaluating the various claims and is hopeful it still will be able to consummate the shareholder federal class action litigation settlement  in the manner announced by the company in its press release on april   as filed on form k on that date 
however  at this time  the company is unable to determine what effect  if any  the derivative suit will have on its ability to consummate such settlement 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future we intend to retain our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business 
additionally  covenants in our long term debt agreements impose significant restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 
risks related to the inherent limitations of internal control systems the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls  disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and prudent industry practice 
however  we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
in addition  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs 
due to the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
further  controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more persons  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk exposure for the company is interest rate risk 
the company s existing debt facilities require the payment of interest at a variable rate equal to one month libor plus basis points 
consequently  the company has an exposure to fluctuations in the underlying interest rate for its debt facilities 
as an example  the prevailing rate for one month libor at january  was 
therefore  the company s borrowing cost under its existing debt facilities as of january  was 
for each million of borrowing at the january  one month libor interest rate  the company s annual interest cost would be  significant fluctuations in the underlying libor interest rate index could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
presently  the company does not utilize any financial instruments to manage this interest rate risk 
the company also has a market risk exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company has a limited number of purchase and sale transactions that are denominated in british pounds 
the company s strategy in managing this risk exposure is to match the timing of british pound denominated cash inflows and outflows 
british pound denominated cash inflows generally exceed outflows  and the excess balance  if nominal  is maintained in a british pound denominated bank account 
substantial amounts of foreign currency are otherwise immediately converted to us dollars when received
