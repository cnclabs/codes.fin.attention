prior year amounts revised 
us branded pharmaceuticals international generics usg us generic pharmaceuticals includes semi solids and solid dose generic pharmaceuticals ah animal health opb the faulding oral pharmaceuticals business purchased december  consisting of us operations opb us and an operation in china opb china 
business segment overview the company is a global generic pharmaceutical company that develops  manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products for humans and animals 
the company offers a comprehensive range of generic human pharmaceutical products in over tablet  capsule  liquid and topical formulations and dosage forms

bp includes the kadian branded product line 
ig is an international generic business primarily in europe with subsidiaries in indonesia and china 
usg is the us generic business 
the main factors affecting the human pharmaceutical business are generic pharmaceutical markets in the us and internationally are extremely competitive and or regulated by governments which exerts downward pressure on prices 
competition is expected to increase in most generic markets as indian pharmaceutical companies seek to increase exports and form partnerships with companies in the us and europe 
success in the generic industry depends on developing  manufacturing and marketing new products  including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection 
the successful introduction of new products is affected by the timing of introduction 
being first to market can bring significant returns 
introducing a new product after or with a number of competitors generates significantly lower returns 
during  the company launched three new products in the us the number of competitors caused pricing and market share to be significantly lower than expected

in addition  demand for company products has been and could continue to be reduced by bans or restrictions on the use of antibiotics and human health risks such as mad cow bse disease and asian bird flu 
production of api s and mfa s from low cost countries such as india and china has increased competition and lowered pricing 
the company business segments also have significant intangible assets and goodwill which require impairment testing and possible write downs based on triggering events which indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable eg increased competition  changes in future plans

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
all professional accounting standards that are effective as of december   have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the company has chosen to highlight certain policies  which include estimates  that it considers critical to the operations of the business and its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
certain of the company s subsidiaries have terms of fob shipping point where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment 
certain subsidiaries have terms fob destination where title and risk of loss transfer on delivery 
in the case of fob destination  revenue is not recognized until products are received by the customer 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
in the company s us generic pharmaceutical and branded pharmaceutical businesses  and to a lesser extent in international generics  sales to certain customers require that the company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates  chargebacks  price adjustments  discounts  promotional allowances  profit sharing  or other managed care allowances 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
provisions for these discounts are reflected in the statement of operations as a reduction of net sales 
there were no material changes in estimates associated with aggregate provisions in  and accruals are reflected on the balance sheet with the reserve balances associated with these deductions from revenue classified either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable or  to the extent that they are due to entities other than customers  as accrued expenses 
the reserve balances relative to these provisions included in accounts receivable  net and accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  the company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these deductions from revenue by comparison of estimated amounts to actual experience 
provisions in usg and bp for rebates  chargebacks  discounts  promotional and medicaid allowances and other credits are considered by the company as different means to reflect price reductions to customers  both direct and indirect 
included within the above provisions are accrual balances for price reductions at december  and of million and million  respectively 
provisions in usg and bp for floorstock price adjustments  product returns and profit sharing are generally considered by the company as reflecting costs of maintaining favorable competitive relationships with the customer 
included within the above provisions are accrual balances for customer relationships of million and million at december  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  usg launched three new products 
the company estimated provisions for product returns  price adjustments  chargebacks and other reserves in a similar manner as other products 
provisions in international subsidiaries for rebates  chargebacks  returns and other discounts are more diverse and vary by location 
included within the above provisions are  in total  at december  and  accrual balances of million and million  respectively 
provisions for rebates  discounts  promotional allowances  profit sharing  managed care allowances and other credits are made at the time of sale and are estimated primarily based on contract terms and historical relationship to revenues 
such provisions are determinable due to definitive contract terms and general consistency of historical experience 
provisions for chargebacks  price adjustments and returns require management to make more subjective  and oftentimes complex  judgments 
these provisions are discussed below 
chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
the company markets products directly to wholesalers  distributors  retail pharmacy chains  mail order pharmacies and group purchasing organizations 
the company also markets products indirectly to chain pharmacies  independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes and pharmacy benefit management companies  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
the company enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices 
alternatively  certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers which establish contract pricing for certain products that the wholesalers provide 
under either arrangement  the company will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler s invoice price 
such credit is called a chargeback  and the difference between the contracted price and the wholesaler s invoice price is referred to as the chargeback rate 
the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers  as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
the information regarding inventory levels within the distribution channel is derived from inventory management reports purchased from major wholesale customers 
the company continually monitors its provision for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it is believed that actual chargeback rates differ from chargeback rates used to establish reserves 
price adjustments price adjustments  which include shelf stock adjustments  are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the company s products 
shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction 
decreases in the company s selling prices are discretionary decisions made to reflect current market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated launch dates of competing products  estimated declines in market price  and  in the case of shelf stock adjustments  estimates of inventory held by the customer 
the company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates its reserves and estimates as additional information becomes available 
returns consistent with industry practice  the company maintains a returns policy that allows its customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date generally  six months before and twelve months after product expiration the estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns 
additionally  the company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel  product dating and expiration period  whether products have been discontinued  entrance in the market of additional generic competition  changes in formularies or launch of over the counter products  to name a few  and makes adjustments to the provision for returns in the event that it appears that actual product returns may differ from established reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets the company has completed several acquisitions since  which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by the company 
in addition  in  upon adoption of sfas  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and reviewed goodwill upon transition and at each year end for impairment 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations 
these allocations  including an assessment of estimated useful lives  have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
the year end long term usg plan reflected the impact of emerging external factors including the increasing number of competitors  including at times authorized generics  and recent experience with a product launch for which pricing was below raw material costs 
the impact of these factors was significant in valuing the future contribution from future new product launches 
the year end assessment indicated an impairment of usg s goodwill 
the company has engaged its independent valuation firm to perform the fas step ii valuation of usg 
based upon the fas step ii valuation work performed to date  the company has recorded an estimated impairment loss of million 
asset impairments long lived assets  including plant and equipment  and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a diminution in value may have occurred  based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset 
if the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with sfas the assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgments and estimates by the company  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by the asset  including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action  the risk associated with those cash flows  and the company s cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized 
in the case of asset or business divestitures the difficulty of assessing a potential impairment is intensified 
the sale of a business or asset is not assured regardless of the intention of the company until an unrelated third party and the company reach a mutually acceptable agreement 
while both parties can genuinely want an agreement  no divestiture is probable until a final agreement has been negotiated and signed 
the company has certain assets not presently fully utilized for production which are expected to be operational in these under utilized or idle assets also require judgment in determining their probable future cash flows 
at year end  the company s plan for a facility changed such that a portion of its value would not be recovered 
this change in plan resulted in an impairment of the facility of million 
research and development r d  including in process r d ipr d the company s products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities  principally the food and drug administration fda in the united states and equivalent authorities in international markets 
research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred  as the company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs 
with respect to completed acquisitions  acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility  signified by fda or comparable regulatory body approval  are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits 
estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in goodwill and intangible assets above 
acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility ie  regulatory approval are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition 
in connection with its acquisitions  the company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of ipr d charges 
the amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project  the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project  and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis for all inventories 
the determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors  including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices 
inventories determined to be damaged  obsolete  or otherwise unsaleable are written down to net realizable value 
the company also purchases raw materials  and manufactures finished goods  for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation 
the company reviews these inventories on a case by case basis  and records a write down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained  litigation will be resolved unfavorably  or the inventory s cost will not be recoverable based on other factors 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pension  post retirement  post employment and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost and trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from actuaries 
litigation and contingencies the company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business  and also to certain other contingencies see item of this form k and note to the financial statements 
the company records legal fees and other expenses related to litigation and contingencies as incurred 
additionally  the company assesses  in consultation with its counsel  the need to record liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis 
reserves are recorded when the company  in consultation with counsel  determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization  which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
the company has recorded certain us deferred tax assets for which it has provided a full valuation allowance as of december  in this assessment  factors such as current and previous us operating losses are given substantially more weight than the outlook for future profitability 
the full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets was determined to be appropriate at december  due to a change in certain available tax planning strategies and continued us losses 
as a result  the company no longer considers it more likely than not that these net us deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore  a full valuation allowance was required at december  should it be determined in the future that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized  the valuation allowance would be removed against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources at december   stockholders equity was million compared to  million and  million at december   and  respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to equity was  
and 
at december   and  respectively 
the decrease in stockholders equity in results primarily from the goodwill impairment charge and the deferred tax valuation allowance recognized in results of operations 
at december   due primarily to the weakening of the us dollar against many other currencies  the company has other comprehensive income of million 
the increase in stockholders equity in results primarily from the translation of foreign currencies into the us dollar 
at december   due primarily to the weakening of the us dollar against many other currencies  the company has other comprehensive income of million 
at december   th e company had an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million 
the increase in stockholders equity in mainly represents the exchanges of convertible notes to equity and miscellaneous equity issuances totaling million and million of other comprehensive income primarily due to a positive currency translation adjustment reflecting the weakening in of the us dollar  offset by a net loss of million  and dividends of million 
in  the company reduced long term debt by approximately million due to exchange of convertible debentures for equity and repayment of million of long term debt  principally with funds from operating cash flow 
in  long term debt was reduced by million due to repayments from operating cash flow 
in  long term debt was reduced by million due to repayments from operating cash flow 
working capital at december   was million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
the current ratio was at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the decline in working capital and the current ratio in is mainly the result of the classification of million of the convertible debentures as a current liability 
the debentures must be reduced to million by december  to remain in compliance with the credit facility 
cash flow from operations in was million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
cash flows reflect net losses of million  offset entirely by non cash expenses for goodwill impairment of million and depreciation  amortization and interest accretion totaling million 
better working capital management  the establishment of a deferred tax valuation allowance non cash and other items make up the balance of the cash provided by operating activities in cash flow from operations in was negatively impacted by million in debt placement fees paid in connection with the issuance of senior notes in the second quarter 
cash flows reflected the generally non cash nature of charges incurred in both the asset write downs and the debt reduction required substantial non cash charges 
in  accounts receivable balances decreased million  net of foreign currency  compared to since  the company has emphasized accounts receivable management company wide 
this emphasis has generally yielded positive results  although not all customers follow stated terms and disputes can slow collection 
the emphasis on accounts receivable management  mentioned above  also contributed to these declines 
balance sheet amounts increased as of december  compared to december in us dollars as the functional currencies of the company s principal foreign subsidiaries  the norwegian kroner  danish krone  the euro  and british pound  appreciated versus the us dollar by approximately   and  respectively 
these increases in balance sheet amounts impact to some degree the above mentioned ratios 
the approximate increase due to currency translation of selected captions was accounts receivable million  inventories million  accounts payable and accrued expenses million  and total stockholder s equity million 
the million increase in stockholder s equity is included in other comprehensive income for the year and results from the weakening of the us dollar in against all major functional currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
in  the company s capital expenditures  including expenditures for purchased dossiers  were million 
capital expenditures relate to a number of capital projects  including the construction of an additional api capacity in copenhagen 
in  the company plans to spend up to approximately million  primarily related to fda compliance and scientific affairs 
at december   the company had million in cash and available short term lines of credit of approximately million and million available under its credit facility 
a portion of the company s short term and long term debt is at variable interest rates 
the credit facility required the company to enter into swaps such that interest is fixed on of its debt 
at december   the company has no outstanding interest rate agreement to fix interest rates of its variable rate debt as it has over of its debt at fixed rates 
the company s policy is to selectively enter into standard agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent 
in the fourth quarter of the company completed the acquisition of the faulding oral pharmaceuticals business opb and entered into a million credit facility credit facility to finance the acquisition and replace its previous credit agreement 
the credit facility includes covenants that require it to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial conditions consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test  a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test  a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test 
a breach of any of these covenants  if not cured or waived  could result in a default under the credit facility 
if an event of default under the credit facility occurs  the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and pa yable 
the calculation of ebitda  as defined in the credit facility  on a rolling four quarter basis is important to many of these tests 
these covenants have been amended from time to time  including amendments made in may and august  and march continued compliance with these financial covenants in is dependent on the company s ebitda as defined by the credit agreement  and therefore the company s ability to generate increasing amounts of operating income  or on the company s ability to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt 
since december  the company has reduced the amount of its outstanding debt and the size of the original facility by prepaying term debt by million and by lowering the revolving line of credit by million 
on an overall basis  senior debt and total debt at december  were million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  at december  included in senior debt at december   was million of senior notes  which replaced debt previously classified as senior subordinated notes see note for further details 
the company s ebitda  as defined  is affected most directly by changes in operating income 
the definition of ebitda allows for the add back of non cash charges  including goodwill impairment 
operating income in has been negatively affected by business conditions in usg and by corrective actions related to the company s response to fda form s issued for the company s us human pharmaceuticals plants in baltimore liquids and elizabeth solid dose 
the corrective action plans have included consulting and other costs and have resulted in lower production and significant rationalization of the liquids product line at the baltimore plant and production delays and interruptions at the elizabeth plant 
the fda completed an inspection of the company s elizabeth solid dose site in december and advised the company that  as a result of this inspection  product approvals relating to the elizabeth site would be withheld pending a successful follow up inspection 
major elements of the fda compliance enhancement plan have been completed 
the company anticipates it will be the subject of another inspection in in september  the fda inspected elizabeth and has since advised the company it is eligible for new product approvals 
since the september inspection  the company has received four new product approvals 
in the fourth quarter of  the company launched both its gabapentin capsules and tablets for the elizabeth site 
the company expects to continue upgrading plant procedures at the baltimore facility in accordance with the october corrective action plan and will continue to provide written monthly updates to the fda 
the plan anticipates substantial completion of the corrective actions by the end of  subject to the fda s final review and satisfaction with the actions taken 
representatives of the company and the baltimore facility met with baltimore fda in the fourth quarter of to discuss progress on the corrective action plan and to clarify expectations and deliverables 
the company anticipates it will be the subject of another inspection in early while the company has received no indications from the fda  the total cost and timing of both the elizabeth and baltimore corrective action plans are subject to change based upon results of future inspections performed by the respective baltimore and new jersey districts of the fda

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s risk management practice includes the selective use  on a limited basis  of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate agreements 
such instruments are used for purposes other than trading 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in us dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies 
the company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations 
the company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary s functional currency 
such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment 
at december   the company had forward foreign exchange contracts mainly denominated in euros  danish krones  norwegian krones  british pounds  hungarian forint and us dollars with a notional amount of million 
the fair market value of such contracts has been recognized in the financial statements and is not material 
all contracts expire in the first quarter of the cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non functional currency transactions 
the change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be less than million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable 
such contracts are not designated hedges for accounting purposes 
interest rate risk alpharma s interest rate risk relates primarily to long term and short term debt which has variable interest rates and reset generally every three months 
at december   the company has million of variable rate us dollar debt under its credit agreement
