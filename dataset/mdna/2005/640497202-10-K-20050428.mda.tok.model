item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when used in this discussion  the words expects  anticipates  believes and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect management s current intentions and expectations 
however  actual events and results could vary significantly based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to customer acceptance of new neomagic products  the market acceptance of handheld devices developed and marketed by customers that use our products  our ability to execute product and technology development plans on schedule  and our ability to access advanced manufacturing technologies in sufficient capacity without significant cash pre payments or investment 
examples of forward looking statements include statements about our expected revenues  our competitive advantage in our markets  the potential market for our products  our expected production timelines  our customer base and our need for additional financing beyond the next months 
these statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below under factors that may affect results  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected

overview neomagic designs  develops and markets high performance  power efficient applications processors that enable multimedia features and applications in mobile phones and other handheld devices 
in the past  we provided semiconductor solutions  called multimedia accelerators  to top notebook computer manufacturers 
in april  we began to exit the multimedia accelerator market 
however  the majority of our historical net sales through the end of fiscal year continued to come from these multimedia accelerator products 
we do not expect to have revenue related to these products in the future 
we are now focused solely on the applications processor market 
neomagic has established relationships with third party manufacturing partners to produce semiconductor products for us 
pursuant to these relationships  we design the overall product  including the logic and analog circuitry  and the manufacturing partners manufacture the wafers  perform testing and package the products 
we are focused on leveraging our core competencies in integrating logic  analog and memory  along with graphics  video  d and other multimedia technologies  drivers  middleware and operating system software  and power management in our continued development of solutions that facilitate the mobilization of multimedia applications 
in november of  we introduced a new technology architecture  called associative processor array apa 
the apa architecture uses a massively parallel approach to processing information  which means that apa operates on multimedia data in parallel  without increasing clock rates 
existing competitive solutions use a sequential processing flow that operates on each individual data element in sequence  relying on ever faster clock rates to improve performance 
these faster clock rates burn power  thus reducing battery life 
with its ability to handle large amounts of data simultaneously and at lower clock rates  the apa platform is able to process multimedia data such as video  still pictures and audio with low power consumption 
we anticipate that the mimagic  the first of our chips to use apa  will begin production shipments during the fourth quarter of calendar year our fiscal year ends on the last sunday in january 
for ease of presentation  the accompanying financial statements have been shown as ending on january and calendar quarter ends for all annual and quarterly financial statement captions 
fiscal year consisted of weeks and ended on january  fiscal years and consisted of weeks each and ended on january and january  respectively 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates neomagic s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets and long lived assets  revenue recognition  inventories and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenue and expenses and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
intangible assets and long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of identifiable intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in our market value  significant reductions in projected future cash flows or gross margins  or macroeconomic factors including a prolonged economic downturn 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we will be required to write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon the weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including gross profit margins  long term forecasts of the amount and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down or write off long lived assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company determined that certain licensed intellectual property was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million of which million was charged to cost of sales for licensed intellectual property which related to products currently in production 
the impairment was caused by a decline in the related sales forecasts of products associated with the licensed intellectual property 
the impairment charge recorded represents the amount by which the carrying amount of the licensed intellectual property exceeded its fair value  which was determined based on the company s estimated discounted future cash flows identifiable to the licensed intellectual property 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we wrote off licensed intangible properties with a net book value of million relating to licensed intellectual property that will no longer be used 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we also determined that certain intangible assets purchased as part of the linkup systems corporation linkup acquisition completed in december were impaired and recorded a total impairment charge of million 
we continue to periodically evaluate our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas and acknowledge it is possible that such evaluation might result in future adjustments for impairment 
such an impairment might adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from non distributor product sales when the products are shipped to customers  title has transferred  and no obligations remain 
thus  we require the following i execution of a written customer order  ii shipment of the product  iii fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility of the proceeds is probable 
our shipment terms are fob shipping point 
for products shipped to distributors  we defer recognition of revenue until the distributors sell the products to their customers 
on occasion  however  we will sell products with end of life status to distributors under special arrangements without any price protection or return privileges for which we recognize revenue upon transfer of title  typically at the time of shipping 
at the end of each accounting period  we make a determination of certain factors including sales returns and allowances  which could affect the amount of revenue recorded for the period 
sales returns provisions include considerations for known but unprocessed sales returns and estimation for unknown returns based on historical experiences 
actual sales returns may vary significantly from historical experience and could have a material effect on our operating results 
inventory valuation our inventory valuation policy stipulates that at the end of each reporting period we write down or write off our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
the amount of the write down or write off is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or write offs may be required 
additionally  as we introduce product enhancements and new products  demand for our existing products in inventory may decrease  requiring additional inventory write downs 
deferred taxes and tax accruals we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
based on the uncertainty of future pre tax income  we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period when such determination was made 
we have also provided accruals for certain tax liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  or less than currently assessed  the resulting reversal of such accruals would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period when the accruals are no longer deemed necessary 
conversely  if our estimate of tax liabilities is more than the amount ultimately assessed  further charges would result 
results of operations net sales net sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to increased shipments of approximately million of our mimagic applications processor for the handheld devices market 
the decrease in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to customer delays in bringing their mimagic related programs to commercial production 
we expect that the percentage of our net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period when new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their product life cycles 

table of contents sales to customers located outside the united states including sales to the foreign operations of customers with headquarters in the united states  and foreign manufacturers that sell to united states based oems accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales

cost of sales includes amortization of deferred compensation of and thousand in fiscal and  respectively 
there was no amortization of deferred compensation in fiscal the increased negative margins in fiscal were largely due to the write off of excess mimagic inventory of approximately million 
fiscal excess inventory write offs were approximately million primarily related to our nmc companion chip and our mimagic applications processor 
in addition  fiscal gross loss included million of amortization of licensed intellectual property as well as a million impairment charge for licensed intellectual property 
the negative gross margin in fiscal is generally due to under absorption of manufacturing overhead resulting from relatively low production levels 
gross loss improved in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the absence of developed technology write offs totaling million that occurred in fiscal the negative gross margin in fiscal is due to under absorption of manufacturing overhead resulting from low production levels and amortization of million and impairment charges of million for acquired developed technology 
in the future  our gross margin percentages may be affected by increased competition and related decline in unit average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  changes in the mix of products sold  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from our suppliers  inventory write offs  and manufacturing yields particularly on new products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include compensation and associated costs relating to research and development personnel  amortization of intangible assets and prototyping costs  which are comprised of photomask costs and pre production wafer costs 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenses include amortization of deferred compensation of million  million  and million in fiscal   and 
table of contents respectively 
we have made  and intend to continue to make  significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products to serve our identified markets 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal of million is primarily related to lower depreciation of million due to certain fixed assets being fully depreciated throughout fiscal year  lower outside consultant costs of million and lower allocation costs of million due to lower allocated it department depreciation and other allocated costs 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to lower labor costs of million  lower amortization of acquired and licensed intangibles of million  lower software license and maintenance costs of million and lower outside consulting costs of million 
labor costs decreased largely due to one year company wide salary reductions in fiscal included in the research and development expenses for fiscal was a charge of million to write off certain licensed intellectual property 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
these expenses include amortization of deferred compensation of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal due to increased labor costs of million mainly due to reinstatement of salaries after a one year reduction  and increased audit fees of million offset by decreased cost of boards used to demonstrate neomagic products of million and lower allocation costs of million 
audit expenses increased due to increased procedures required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to lower labor costs of million and lower amortization of deferred compensation of million 
labor costs decreased largely due to company wide salary reductions in fiscal special charge in january  we extended our wafer supply agreement with infineon technologies ag infineon of germany through fiscal to ensure future wafer supply for our new product efforts 
neomagic provided million in guarantees towards its wafer purchases over the term of the agreement 
the amount of guarantee was included as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet  as of january  due to uncertainties over infineon s continued product development with respect to embedded dram edram  we decided not to use infineon s edram technology for its future production needs 
based on negotiations between neomagic and infineon on restructuring the wafer supply agreement with the intent to release neomagic from the related guarantee  we recorded million in charges  composed of a million cash payment and the issuance of million in common stock  which reflects the value of the final settlement in fiscal the amount was recorded as a special charge in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal as a result of the settlement  million of restricted cash was released and reclassified to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet in fiscal impairment of certain acquired and licensed intangible assets neomagic adopted sfas in the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with sfas  we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and whenever there are indicators of impairment  by comparing projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets against their respective carrying amounts to determine whether impairment exists 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
during fiscal  we determined that certain licensed intellectual property was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million of which million was charged to cost of sales 
the impairment was caused by a decline in the related sales forecasts of products associated with the licensed intellectual property 
during fiscal  we determined that certain intangible assets purchased as part of the linkup systems corporation acquisition completed in december were impaired and recorded a total impairment charge of 
table of contents million  during the period 
of the total impairment charge  thousand related to impairment of certain acquired intangibles that were capitalized relating to developed technology 
the impairment was caused by a decline in the related sales forecasts of products associated with the intangibles 
the impairment charge relating to developed technology is included in the cost of sales section of the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we also recorded a thousand impairment charge with respect to intangibles relating to customer relationships 
several key customers with whom we were engaged abandoned their related product plans  which led to the impairment 
we also recorded a thousand impairment charge with respect to intangibles that were capitalized as internal use software 
we no longer use the software 
the impairment charge relating to customer relationships and internal use software is included in the operating expenses section of the consolidated statements of operations in fiscal income  net of expenses  from the sale of dvd assets in april  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement  we sold the principal assets of our dvd product group  primarily consisting of fixed assets and intangible assets  to lsi logic buyer 
we received million in a lump sum cash payment and an additional million was contingent on our performance of certain obligations related to the transfer of licenses with third parties to the buyer 
we received a million cash payment which was previously contingent on our performance of certain obligations related to the transfer of licenses with third parties to the buyer in fiscal in fiscal  we received the remaining contingent payment of million upon completing the transfer of licenses with third parties to the buyer  and recorded the amount as a gain in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended january  cumulative change in accounting principle on february   neomagic adopted statement of accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangibles assets  which required companies to discontinue the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
instead  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life must be reviewed for impairment using a two step method upon adoption of sfas and annually thereafter  or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
upon adoption of sfas  we were required to complete the two step transitional goodwill impairment test 
we completed step one of the transitional impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal and determined that there were indicators of impairment  as the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value derived from the market capitalization model 
the second step of the transitional impairment test to determine the amount of impairment was completed in the third quarter of fiscal by comparing fair value to carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recorded as an impairment loss 
based on the results of the second transitional impairment test  we recorded a non cash charge of million  to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in fiscal interest income and other we earn interest on our cash and short term investments 
interest income and other was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to lower average cash and short term investment balances 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to lower interest income earned on lower average cash balances and from interest rate reductions that occurred in fiscal interest expense interest expense was million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is due to accreted interest expense of million recorded in fiscal related to our mandatorily redeemable series b convertible preferred stock issued in august in 
table of contents addition  we recorded thousand of interest amortization for deferred financing costs related to our mandatorily redeemable series b preferred stock during fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to new capital leases entered into in the latter part of fiscal being outstanding for the entire fiscal income taxes we recorded a tax provision of thousand on a pre tax loss of million in fiscal year which consisted of foreign income taxes and an increase of thousand for accrued interest and penalties on tax liabilities 
our effective tax benefit rate was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal in fiscal year  the tax benefit rate differed from the statutory rate due to an increase in our valuation allowance 
the benefit recorded was limited to current cash income tax refunds available 
realization of our deferred tax assets  which have a full valuation allowance  depends on us generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of such realization  the management has concluded that a full valuation allowance is required as of january  the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  enacted on october   provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the united states pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by our chief executive officer and approved by our board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
we have not determined whether we will apply the above provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal year  however  as additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision becomes available  we will continue to analyze and assess whether such repatriation would be practical 
the earnings from foreign operations in india are currently tax exempt pursuant to a tax holiday effective through the incentive provides for certain tax relief if certain conditions are met 
we believe that we continued to be in compliance with these conditions at january  liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  million  and million as of the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in fiscal stems primarily from cash used for operating activities  which includes a net loss of million offset by net maturities of short term investments and proceeds from issuance of mandatorily redeemable series b convertible preferred stock

net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was due to net purchases of short term investments of million and purchases of property  plant  equipment and intangibles of million 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal is primarily due to net maturities of short term investments of million and from proceeds from the sale of dvd assets of million partially offset by purchases of property  plant  equipment and intangibles of million 
continued operation of our business may require higher levels of capital equipment purchases  technology investments  foundry investments and other payments to secure manufacturing capacity 
the timing and amount of future investments will depend primarily on the level of our future revenues 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal we issued preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock for net proceeds of million 
the preferred stock can be converted into  shares of our common stock at any time at the option of the investor 
alternatively  the preferred stock can be redeemed for million in cash in august if the conversion option has not been exercised 
the net proceeds were used to fund operating activities 
see note  mandatorily redeemable series b convertible preferred stock  in the consolidated financial statements for additional information

the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal is due to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations of million 
at january   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  including the net proceeds of million received from our sale of certain patents after january  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  will satisfy our projected cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  we expect we will need to raise additional capital within the next months to fund future operating activities beyond the next months 
if we experience a material shortfall versus our plan for fiscal  we expect to take all appropriate actions to ensure the continuing operation of our business and to mitigate any negative impact on our cash position 
we believe we can take actions to achieve further reductions in our operating expenses  if necessary 
we also believe that we can take actions to generate cash by selling or licensing intellectual property  seeking funding from strategic partners  and seeking further equity or debt financing from financial sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
furthermore  as long as the preferred stock remains outstanding  provisions of the preferred stock limit our ability to issue any security with greater or equal seniority to the preferred stock 
beyond fiscal  the adequacy of our resources will depend largely on our ability to complete additional financing and our success in re establishing profitable operations and positive operating cash flows 
our lease for our headquarters in santa clara  california expires in april we lease offices in israel and india under operating leases that expire in september for israel and in december for india

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the issue s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective with this annual report for fiscal once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  the company will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provisions of eitf in december  the fasb issued sfas no

 as allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
the requirements of sfas no

table of contents in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas amends arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our statements of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the company is required to adopt sfas  on a prospective basis  for nonmonetary exchanges beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated result of operations 
impact of currency exchange rates in fiscal  all of our payments made to our suppliers and all of our payments received from our customers were denominated in us dollars 
we have in the past and may in the future enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize short term foreign currency fluctuation exposures related to firm purchase commitments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these instruments are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating an instrument as a hedge include its effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
notwithstanding the measures we have adopted  due to the unpredictability and volatility of currency exchange rates and currency controls  there can be no assurance that we will not experience currency losses in the future  nor can we predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
factors that may affect results we expect to continue to incur significant losses and consume cash in operations in the fiscal year ending january  we have been incurring substantial losses and consuming cash in operations as we invest heavily in new product development in advance of achieving significant customer sales 
this is expected to continue during the fiscal year ending january  our ability to achieve cash flow breakeven is likely to depend on the success of our mimagic and mimagic products 
however  even if the mimagic  mimagic  and subsequent products achieve widespread customer acceptance  the length of customer design in cycles would preclude substantial product shipments in the fiscal year ending january  accordingly  even if these new products are successful  we are likely to incur significant additional losses and consume cash in operations during the fiscal year ending january  we are likely to need additional capital given the long cycle times required to achieve design wins  convert customer design wins into production orders  and for customers to achieve volume shipments of their products  we are likely to require additional working capital to fund our business 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next months 
however  we expect we will need to raise additional capital to fund future operating activities beyond the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of net sales growth  timing and extent of spending to support research and development programs in new and existing areas of technology  expansion of sales and marketing support 
table of contents activities  and timing and customer acceptance of new products 
our ability to raise capital and the terms of any financing will depend  in part  on our ability to establish customer engagements and generate sales 
as discussed below  revenue performance is difficult to forecast 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
furthermore  as long as the preferred stock remains outstanding  provisions of the preferred stock limit our ability to issue any security with greater or equal seniority to the preferred stock 
our revenues are difficult to predict for a variety of reasons  revenues are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our ability to achieve design wins depends on many factors  many outside our control  including changes in the customer s strategic and financial plans  competitive factors and overall market conditions 
as our experience demonstrates  design wins themselves do not always lead to production orders because the customer may cancel or delay products for a variety of reasons 
such reasons may include the performance of a particular product that may depend on components not supplied by neomagic  market conditions  reorganizations or other internal developments at the customer and changes in customer personnel or strategy 
even when a customer has begun volume production of a product containing our chips  volumes are difficult to forecast because there may be no history to provide a guide  and because market conditions and other factors may cause changes in the customer s plans 
because of the market uncertainties they face  many customers place purchase orders on a short lead time basis  rather than providing reliable long term purchase orders or purchase forecasts 
the difficulty in forecasting revenues increases the difficulty in forecasting our working capital requirements 
it also increases the likelihood that we may overproduce particular parts  resulting in inventory charges  or underproduce particular parts  affecting our ability to meet customer requirements 
the difficulty in forecasting revenues also restricts our ability to provide forward looking revenue and earnings guidance to the financial markets and increases the chance that our performance does not match forecasts 
we depend on qualified personnel our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  finance and executive personnel  and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is strong competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we have experienced the loss of personnel though headcount reductions and attrition 
we have recently lost some of our executive management 
for example  prakash agarwal  one of our co founders who was our president  chief executive officer and a director since our founding  resigned from all these positions on april  our new president and chief executive officer  doug young  has been with us only since february we cannot assure you that the resignation of mr 
agarwal and the appointment of mr 
young will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
all our executive officers are employees at will 
we have no employment contracts and do not maintain key person insurance on any of our personnel 
if we are not able to maintain key personnel  if our headcount is not appropriate for our future direction  or if we fail to recruit key personnel critical to our future direction in a timely manner  this may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our future success will depend in part on our ability to identify and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors 
we believe that maintaining a board of directors comprised of qualified members is critical given the current status of our business and operations 
moreover  nasdaq stock market rules require three outside board members to serve on our audit committee 
any inability on our part to identify and retain qualified board members could have a material adverse effect on our business or could lead to the delisting of our securities from the nasdaq stock market 
we have a limited customer base three customers accounted for   and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal four customers accounted for   and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal four customers accounted for 
table of contents   and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal we expect that a small number of customers will account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  the majority of our sales were historically made  and are expected to continue to be made  on the basis of purchase orders rather than pursuant to long term purchase agreements 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the decision of a single customer to cease using our products  or by a decline in the number of handheld devices sold by a single customer 
we may lose our customer base our products are designed to afford the mobile phone and handheld device manufacturer significant advantages with respect to product performance  power consumption and size 
to the extent that other future developments in components or subassemblies incorporate one or more of the advantages offered by our products  the market demand for our products may be negatively impacted 
we face intense competition in our markets the market for applications processors is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
we believe that the principal factors of competition in this market are video and d graphics performance  price  features  power consumption  size and customer support 
our ability to compete successfully in the applications processor market depends on a number of factors including  success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies  product quality and reliability  price  ramp of production of our products  customer demand and acceptance of more sophisticated multimedia functionality on mobile phones and other handheld devices  end user acceptance of our customers products  market acceptance of competitors products and general economic conditions 
our ability to compete will also depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards and market trends 
we compete with both domestic and international companies  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than us with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
our principal competitors include texas instruments  renesas  st microelectronics and broadcom as well as a number of vertically integrated electronics firms that are developing their own solutions 
we may also face increased competition from new entrants into the market including companies currently at developmental stages 
we believe we have significant intellectual properties and historically demonstrated expertise in soc technology 
however  our inability to introduce timely new products for our market  to support these products in customer programs  or to manufacture these products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
some of our current and potential competitors operate their own manufacturing facilities 
since we do not operate our own manufacturing facility and may from time to time make binding commitments to purchase products binding purchase orders of  were outstanding as of january   we may not be able to reduce our costs and cycle time or adjust our production to meet changing demand as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our products may be incompatible with evolving industry standards and market trends our ability to compete in the future will also depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards and market trends 
unanticipated changes in market trends and industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products or obtain license rights to technologies owned by third parties in order to ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and market trends 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to redesign our products or obtain the necessary third party licenses within the appropriate window of market demand 
if our products are not in 
table of contents compliance with prevailing market trends and industry standards for a significant period of time  we could miss crucial oem original equipment manufacturer and odm original design manufacturer design cycles  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on new product development to meet rapid market and technological change neomagic is focused on providing high performance semiconductor solutions for sale to manufacturers of mobile phones and handheld devices 
new product planning is focused on integrated system on chip soc semiconductor products for handheld devices that integrate multimedia technologies such as h 
video compression  d graphics and audio technologies 
our future business  financial condition and results of operations will depend to a significant extent on our ability to develop new products that address these market opportunities 
as a result  we believe that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future 
we must anticipate the features and functionality that consumers and infrastructure providers will demand  incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the exacting design requirements of equipment manufacturers  price our products competitively and introduce new products to the market on a timely basis 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  the ability to create or acquire intellectual property  the ability of manufacturing partners to effectively manufacture new products  quality of new products  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers 
there can be no assurance that the products we expect to introduce will incorporate the features and functionality demanded by mobile phone and handheld device manufacturers and consumers  will be successfully developed  or will be introduced within the appropriate window of market demand 
there can be no assurance that customers who utilize our semiconductor products will achieve the levels of market success with their own products that they may project to us 
because of the complexity of our products  we have experienced occasional delays in completing development and introduction of new products 
in the event that there are delays in production of current products  or in the completion of development of future products  including the products currently under development for introduction over the next to months  our potential future business  financial condition  and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the time required for competitors to develop and introduce competing products may be shorter  their manufacturing yields may be better  and their production costs may be lower than those experienced by us 
we depend on third party manufacturers to produce our products our products require wafers manufactured with state of the art fabrication equipment and techniques 
we currently utilize several foundries for wafer fabrication 
we expect that  for the foreseeable future  some of our products will be manufactured by a single source 
since  in our experience  the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new wafer fabrication partner is at least months  and the estimated time for a foundry to switch to a new product line ranges from four to nine months  there may be no readily available alternative source of supply for specific products 
a manufacturing disruption experienced by our manufacturing partners  the failure of our manufacturing partners to dedicate adequate resources to the production of our products  or the financial instability of our manufacturing partners would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  in the event that the transition to the next generation of manufacturing technologies by our manufacturing partner is unsuccessful  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
there are many other risks associated with our dependence upon third party manufacturers  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality  manufacturing yields and cost  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  limited warranties on wafers supplied to us  and potential 
table of contents misappropriation of our intellectual property 
we are dependent on our manufacturing partners to produce wafers with acceptable quality and manufacturing yields  to deliver those wafers on a timely basis to our third party assembly subcontractors and to allocate a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs 
although our products are designed using the process design rules of the particular manufacturer  there can be no assurance that our manufacturing partners will be able to achieve or maintain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost 
additionally  there can be no assurance that our manufacturing partners will continue to devote adequate resources to the production of our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based 
we rely on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products our products are assembled and tested by third party subcontractors 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors 
such assembly and testing is conducted on a purchase order basis 
as a result of our reliance on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products  we cannot directly control product delivery schedules  which could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase the costs of manufacturing or assembly of our products 
due to the amount of time normally required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors  product shipments could be delayed significantly if we were required to find alternative subcontractors 
any problems associated with the delivery  quality or cost of the assembly and test of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may encounter inventory excess or shortage we have wafer supply relationships with several foundries to support our product efforts 
normally  we place binding purchase orders two to three months prior to wafer shipment 
we had binding orders for wafers of  outstanding as of january  we order wafers for deliveries in advance and with the additional time to assemble and test wafers  we can have orders for finished goods that will not be available for up to four months into the future 
if we do not have sufficient demand for our products and cannot cancel our current and future commitments without material impact  we may experience excess inventory  which will result in a write off affecting gross margin and results of operations 
if we cancel a purchase order  we must pay cancellation penalties based on the status of work in process or the proximity of the cancellation to the delivery date 
we must place purchase orders for wafers before we receive purchase orders from our own customers 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  which can be unexpected and dramatic  and from time to time will cause us to have an excess or shortage of wafers for a particular product 
as a result of the long lead time for manufacturing wafers and the increase in just in time ordering by customers  semiconductor companies from time to time take charges for excess inventory 
we did in fact incur such charges in fiscal of million 
significant write offs of excess inventory have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
conversely  failure to order sufficient wafers would cause us to miss revenue opportunities and  if significant  could impact sales by our customers  which could adversely affect our customer relationships and thereby materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing yields may fluctuate the fabrication of semiconductors is an extremely complex process  which typically includes hundreds of process steps 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in masks used to print circuits on a wafer  utilization of equipment with variations and numerous other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy 
as a result  semiconductor companies often experience problems in achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  which are represented by the number of good die as a proportion of the total number of die on any particular wafer 
we often purchase wafers  not die  and pay an agreed upon price for wafers meeting certain acceptance criteria 
accordingly  we bear the risk of the yield of good die from wafers purchased meeting the acceptance criteria 

table of contents semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both product design  which is developed largely by us  and process technology  which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer 
historically  we have experienced lower yields on new products 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation and communication between the manufacturer and us 
this risk is compounded by the offshore location of our manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required identifying  communicating and resolving manufacturing yield problems 
as our relationships with new manufacturing partners develop  yields could be adversely affected due to difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of each manufacturer 
any significant decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit product cost and could force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers  potentially adversely impacting customer relationships as well as revenues and gross margins 
there can be no assurance that our manufacturers will achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
uncertainty and litigation risk associated with patents and protection of proprietary rights we rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property 
as of january   we had been issued patents 
however  on april   we announced the sale of patents to faust communications  llc for net proceeds of million 
the patents sold related to our legacy products and not to products that we currently sell or plan to sell 
we retain a worldwide  non exclusive license under the patents sold 
the sale did not include several of our important patents covering embedded dram technology or any of the unique array processing technology used in our mimagic family of applications processors 
the remaining issued patents are scheduled to expire no later than january additionally  we have several patent applications pending 
there can be no assurance that our pending patent applications  or any future applications will be approved 
further  there can be no assurance that any issued patents will provide us with significant intellectual property protection  competitive advantages  or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
we also rely on a combination of mask work protection  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property 
despite these efforts  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property  disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets  or that we can meaningfully protect our intellectual property 
a failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a general matter  the semiconductor industry has experienced substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in december  we filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware seeking damages and an injunction against trident microsystems  inc the suit alleged that trident s embedded dram graphics accelerators infringe certain patents held by the company 
in january  trident filed a counter claim against us alleging an attempted monopolization in violation of antitrust laws  arising from neomagic s filing of the patent infringement action against trident 
since january  no further action has occurred on this counter claim 
the court ruled that there was no infringement by trident 
as a result  we filed an appeal in the united states court of appeals  for the federal circuit 
on april   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the lower court s judgment of non infringement on one patent and vacated the court s judgment of non infringement on another patent  thereby remanding it to the lower court for further proceedings 
in november  the lower court heard oral arguments on cross motions for summary judgment on the matter 
in may  the lower court ruled in favor of trident 
in december  we 
table of contents filed an appeal in the united states court of appeals  for the federal circuit 
in august the federal circuit rejected the appeal and affirmed the lower court s decision of no infringement by the trident products 
while we believe we have valid defenses against trident s counter claim filed in  there can be no assurance as to whether trident will or will not proceed with the counter suit 
any patent litigation  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from productive tasks  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that current or future infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such matter  we could be required to pay substantial damages  which could include treble damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes  or to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance  however  that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any limitations in our ability to market our products  or delays and costs associated with redesigning our products or payments of license fees to third parties  or any failure by us to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on international sales and suppliers export sales have been a critical part of our business 
sales to customers located outside the united states including sales to the foreign operations of customers with headquarters in the united states and foreign manufacturers that sell to united states based oems accounted for  and of our net sales for fiscal   and  respectively 
we expect that net sales derived from international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales 
letters of credit issued by customers have supported a portion of our international sales 
to date  our international sales have been denominated in united states dollars 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency of our customers could make our products relatively more expensive than competitors products sold in the customer s local currency 
international manufacturers have produced  and are expected to continue to produce for the foreseeable future  all of our wafers 
in addition  many of the assembly and test services used by us are procured from international sources 
wafers are priced in us dollars under our purchase orders with our manufacturing suppliers 
international sales and manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences and export license requirements 
in addition  we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally including foreign government regulation  political and economic instability  and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  thus increasing the possibility of piracy of our products and intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these risks will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting could result in an inability to accurately report our financial results effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed 
in connection with 
table of contents our management s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of january   management identified a control deficiency that constituted a material weakness 
as more fully described in item a of this annual report on form k  as of january   our management concluded that we did not maintain effective controls over the process of evaluating impairment of long lived assets 
this control deficiency resulted in a material adjustment recorded by us to the financial statements for the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the material weaknesses identified  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of january  see item a of this annual report on form k 
a failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  including a failure to implement corrective actions to address the control deficiency identified above  could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 
this  in turn  could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
our financial results could be affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
for example  we currently are not required to record stock based compensation charges if an employee s stock option exercise price is equal to or exceeds the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
however  several companies have recently elected to change their accounting policies and begun to record the fair value of stock options as an expense 
the fasb published a pronouncement in december that would require us to record expense for the fair value of stock options granted 
the effective date of the proposed standard is for fiscal years beginning after june  and will be applicable starting in our fiscal year our future operating expenses may be adversely affected in connection with the issuance of stock options 
our stock price may be volatile the market price of our common stock  like that of other semiconductor companies  has been and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our anticipated or actual operating results  announcements of new products  technological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor industry  unanticipated shifts in the markets for mobile phones and other handheld devices or changes in industry standards  losses of key customers  litigation commencement or developments  the impact of our fundraising activities  including dilution to shareholders  changes in or the failure by us to meet estimates of our performance by securities analysts  market conditions for high technology stocks in general  and other events or factors 
in future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
potential nasdaq stock market delisting on february   we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market that we were no longer in compliance with the requirements for continued inclusion of our common stock on the nasdaq national market pursuant to the nasdaq s marketplace rule a the rule because our common stock had closed below per share for consecutive business days 
we were given calendar days  or until august   to regain compliance with the rule

terrorist attacks  terrorist threats  geopolitical instability and government responses thereto  may negatively impact all aspects of neomagic s operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the terrorist attacks in september in the united states had a material adverse effect on the economy 
any similar future events may disrupt neomagic s operations or those of our customers and suppliers 
in addition  any similar future events could have an adverse impact on the us and world economy  in general  and consumer confidence and spending in particular  which could harm neomagic s sales 
any similar future events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets  which could harm neomagic s stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers 
this could have a significant impact on neomagic s operating results  revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of our common stock
