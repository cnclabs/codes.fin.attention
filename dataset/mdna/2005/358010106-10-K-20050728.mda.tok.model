factors that would cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  inability to integrate operations and personnel  actions by significant customers or competitors  general domestic and international economic conditions  consumer spending trends  reliance on key customers  continued acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace  competitive factors  new products and technological changes  product prices and raw material costs  dependence upon third party vendors  competitive developments  changes in manufacturing and transportation costs  the availability of capital  and the outcome of any litigation and arbitration proceedings 
by making these forward looking statements  the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts and the valuation of inventory 
each of these areas requires the company to make use of reasonable estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract  the realizable value of its inventory or the market value of its products 
changes in estimates can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues under larger  long term contracts  generally defined as orders in excess of  are reported in operating results using the percentage of completion method 
for us government and other fixed price contracts that require initial design and development of the product  revenue is recognized on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of sales recorded as the costs are incurred 
each month management reviews estimated contract costs 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
on production type contracts  revenue is recorded as units are delivered with the related cost of sales recognized on each shipment based upon a percentage of estimated final contract costs 
changes in job performance may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined to be required 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
for contracts in the company s gillam fei and fei zyfer segments  smaller contracts or orders in the other business segments and sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon shipment of the product or performance of the services pursuant to contractual terms 
when payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system  revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed 
costs and expenses contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs  manufacturing overhead and other direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory in accordance with industry practice  inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles  a portion of which will not be realized within one year 
inventory reserves are established for slow moving and obsolete items and are based upon management s experience and expectations for future business 
any changes in reserves arising from revised expectations are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
equity based compensation the company applies the disclosure only provisions of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and continues to measure compensation cost in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
historically  this has not resulted in compensation cost upon the grant of options under a qualified stock option plan 
however  in accordance with fas no 
 the company provides pro forma disclosures of net income loss and income loss per share as if the fair value method had been applied beginning in fiscal the following table illustrates the effect on the company s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april  had compensation cost for stock option awards under the plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates consistent with the provisions of fas no

results of operations the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations net sales exclusive of intercompany sales commercial communications us government gillam fei fei zyfer cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expenses compensation charges goodwill writedown research and development expenses operating loss other income  net minority interest provision benefit for income taxes net income loss significant events as more thoroughly described elsewhere in this form k and in the notes to the financial statements  the company s fiscal year  and results of operations were materially impacted by several specific events 
during fiscal year  the company recorded a gain of million on the conversion of its real estate operating partnership units reit units into shares of reckson associates realty corp 
common stock reit stock  thus completing a transaction which was initiated in fiscal year see item properties and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to the conversion  the company sold a portion of the reit stock and realized additional gains of approximately million  or total pretax gains of approximately million 
as a result of these gains  the company also accrued a contractually mandated incentive compensation expense of  which amount is included in operating expenses under the caption compensation charges 
during fiscal year  the company acquired the business and net assets of zyfer  inc in addition to the purchase price  the company invested an additional million of working capital to support the operations of fei zyfer until it could return to profitability 
also  in fiscal year  the company realized a  tax benefit as the result of the reversal of certain tax liabilities established in prior years 
in fiscal  the company determined that the goodwill associated with its investment in gillam fei had become impaired and wrote off the full amount of goodwill in the amount of million 
without these significant events  the company s operating loss profit  pre tax income loss and net income loss would be materially different from that reported in the financial statements 
see note to the financial statements for pro forma presentation related to the acquisition of fei zyfer  inc operating loss the operating loss for the fiscal year ended april   decreased by  to million from the million operating loss for fiscal year the improvement is attributable to the year over year increase in sales coupled with improved gross margins but offset by higher selling and administrative costs  compensation charges and research and development expenditures 
the research and development expenditures represent investments that keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future sales 
the operating loss for the fiscal year ended april   decreased million to million from the operating loss of million reported in fiscal year the improvement is directly attributable to the year over year increase in sales volume during fiscal year as well as the significant fiscal year events which did not recur in fiscal year the million goodwill impairment see above and million in inventory adjustments 
these improvements were offset by the fiscal year operating loss of million recorded by fei zyfer 
net sales net sales for fiscal year increased by million to million from fiscal year revenues of million 
sales increases were experienced in three of the company s four segments 
commercial communication revenues increased by million  largely on increased revenues from commercial space programs 
gillam fei revenue exclusive of intercompany sales of million related to a research and development program improved by million of which approximately is attributable to appreciation in the value of the euro to the dollar during fiscal year fei zyfer s revenues increased by million or  continuing its improved performance which began in the second half of fiscal year only the revenues of the us government segment experienced a decline of million compared to fiscal year as the company worked on several smaller dollar development contracts versus higher volume production programs 
the company expects to realize significant revenue increases in the us government segment during fiscal year based on new production programs and recent contract awards 
similarly  each of the other three segments is expected to show increased revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales for fiscal year increased by million to million from fiscal year revenues of million 
these revenues include million from fei zyfer  or of the year over year increase  while sales from the other segments increased by million over the prior year 
this increase is attributable to strong second half revenues in the commercial communications and gillam fei segments compared to both the first half of the fiscal year as well as to fiscal year revenues 
commercial communication revenues were up million over the prior year on the strength of increased capital spending on cellular network infrastructure and sales related to commercial satellites 
gillam fei revenues exclusive of million in intersegment sales related to a research and development program increased by over  from the prior year  benefiting primarily from the year over year increase in the value of the euro to the dollar 
fiscal year revenues from the us government segment declined by million from the prior year as the company worked on several developmental programs under us government contracts as compared to more production type contracts in the prior year 
demand for the company s commercial communications products by wireless infrastructure original equipment manufacturers  has fluctuated in recent years 
demand peaked during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and through the first quarter of fiscal year this was followed by sequential declines in the subsequent quarters of fiscal year as end users postponed deployment of next generation cellular base stations 
the company continues to believe  however  that the world wide market for its synchronization products for the wireless industry remains extremely large and will grow 
the company anticipates that some of this growth will materialize during the latter portion of fiscal year in addition  world wide capital spending on commercial satellites and wireline synchronization systems is increasing 
accordingly  the company believes future sales in the commercial communications and gillam fei segments will increase over the levels achieved in fiscal year based on the company s recent work on us government sponsored development contracts and current proposal activity  the company expects revenues from us government programs to increase during fiscal year the us government is expected to provide funding for such projects as secure radios  new communication satellites  unmanned aerial vehicles  weapons guidance systems and secure communications 
the resultant increased revenue stream will benefit the company s us government and fei zyfer segments 
gross margin rates the gross margin rate for fiscal year improved to of net sales compared to in fiscal year the improvement is primarily attributable to increased revenue in fiscal year which is able to absorb a greater share of fixed costs 
gross margin improvements were partially offset by additional work required on certain space programs to address technical issues encountered at the near conclusion of these programs 
the gross margin rate for fiscal year improved to of net sales compared to in fiscal year the fiscal year rate was reduced by due to a million inventory adjustment 
although fiscal year sales increased substantially over the prior year  the volume was insufficient to fully absorb the overhead  particularly in the first half of the current fiscal year when lower revenues were recorded 
in the second half of the year  the company experienced rising revenues but also built up its support structure to sustain the expected higher level of sales 
the company also reduced the value of its inventory by  as the result of an inventory revaluation during fiscal year the company s target is to achieve an overall gross margin rate of or better through greater sales volume  continued process improvements and utilization of lower cost manufacturing in russia and china 
during fiscal year  if revenues increase as anticipated  the company expects to realize gross margin rates approaching its targeted rate 
compensation charges under the caption compensation charges  the company has recorded certain expenses which are defined as operating expenses which are not expected to recur 
as indicated above  during fiscal year the company accrued a  incentive compensation expense related to the conversion and sale of reit units 
in addition  the company recorded a non cash charge of  to increase the liability under its deferred compensation plan 
this charge was based on updated life expectancy charts utilized by the company s actuary 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company s belgian subsidiary recorded an accrual for  related to litigation with a former employee 
during fiscal year  the company s majority owned subsidiary in france substantially completed a restructuring of its operations as a result of the company s decision to convert it from a manufacturing facility to a regional sales office 
this resulted in a charge to earnings of  consisting primarily of employee severance costs  for the year ended april  the company does not expect to incur significant costs in the future related to this restructuring although it may recognize a gain during fiscal year upon the sale of the subsidiary s current manufacturing facility 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  in connection with an employment agreement initiated in  the company awarded its chairman of the board and former ceo a stock bonus of  shares which had a value of approximately  selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative costs in fiscal year increased by  to million from million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  the company incurred larger deferred compensation expense exclusive of the charge included in compensation charges  increased salaries for support personnel  incurred information technology consulting fees as the company upgraded its erp system and higher professional fees related to the company s efforts to comply with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of these expenses were partially offset by savings obtained from the mid year closing of the company s european sales office and merging those functions into the company s belgian subsidiary 
selling and administrative costs in fiscal year increased by million to million from million in fiscal year the largest component of this increase is the approximately million of selling and administrative expenses incurred at then newly acquired fei zyfer 
the additional  of expenses is commensurate with the increased volume of business that the company experienced in fiscal year costs such as commission expenses  salaries of additional marketing and support personnel and performance related compensation all contributed to increased selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year these increases were offset by declines in deferred compensation expenses 
in addition  the value of the euro to the us dollar continued to rise throughout fiscal year as a result  gillam fei s euro denominated selling and administrative costs declined by but  when converted to us dollars  reflected a increase over fiscal year as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses were in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year the company targets selling and administrative expenses not to exceed of consolidated sales 
the level of sales  which were lower than anticipated each fiscal year  prevented the company from achieving its target 
if revenues improve as anticipated in fiscal year  the company expects to achieve its targeted level of selling and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in fiscal year increased by million to million from million in fiscal year the company devoted significant resources to completion of its new usg and associated products for wireline synchronization  developed new hardware for space applications and further enhanced the performance of low g gravity sensitivity oscillators which have broad applications in both commercial and us government systems 
these research and development expenditures represent investments that keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future sales 
research and development expenses in fiscal year increased by  to million from million in fiscal year this increase is entirely attributable to development costs incurred at fei zyfer which approximated  without fei zyfer  research and development expense would have declined by from fiscal year during fiscal year  those resources previously devoted to the company s internal research and development efforts were often redirected to funded research projects 
consequently  the costs of these resources are reflected in cost of sales rather than in research and development expenses 
internal development efforts during fiscal year were focused on gillam fei s usg system  developing a digital rubidium oscillator  and further improving the performance of crystal oscillators  including low g sensitivity crystal oscillators 
the company will continue to focus its research and development activities on those products which it expects will provide the best return on investment and greatest prospects for the future growth of the company 
for fiscal year  the company will make additional investments in developing manufacturing process improvements for its new usg wireline synchronization product 
additional funds will be invested in improving and miniaturizing rubidium atomic clocks  developing new gps based synchronization products and further enhancing the capabilities of its line of crystal oscillators 
the company s target is to spend approximately of revenues on research and development activities  although the actual level of spending is dependent on new opportunites and the rate at which it succeeds in bringing new products to market 
internally generated cash and cash reserves will be adequate to fund these development efforts 
other income  expense other income increased by million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the largest component of this increase is described above under significant events for fiscal year the conversion of reit units for reit stock and the subsequent partial sale of these shares 
other income expense  increased by  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year amounts for both years have been restated from prior year reporting as a result of a change in accounting for the company s investment in morion  inc with its increased ownership interest at of morion s outstanding shares  the company changed its method of accounting from the cost to the equity method 
accordingly  prior years include the company s share of morion s net income in the amount of  for fiscal year and  for fiscal year investment income during fiscal year increased by million over fiscal year and fiscal year increased by  over fiscal year in all three years  the company recorded realized gains and losses on marketable securities 
in fiscal year  the company realized gains of million on the sale of a portion of the reit stock 
see item properties and note to the accompanying financial statements 
in fiscal year  the company realized gains of  on the sale of certain marketable securities 
in fiscal year  realized losses on marketable securities of  were partially offset by realized gains of  investment income also includes interest and dividends earned on marketable securities  including dividend income from reit units 
interest income has declined in each of fiscal years  and from that realized in each prior year due to a combination of lower interest rates and a decreased level of invested assets 
the company anticipates that during fiscal year it will realize additional gains on marketable securities  particularly on additional sales of the reit stock 
these gains will be offset by lower income from interest and dividends since invested assets will decline after payment of income tax obligations related to the investment gains and as the company invests the net proceeds in lower yielding instruments 
interest expense for the year ended april  decreased by  as compared to fiscal year and the expense for the year ended april  increased by  compared to fiscal year the decline in fiscal year is due to the paydown during the year of both short term and long term credit obligations 
the increase in fiscal is attributable to short term borrowings by the company to fund its working capital requirements 
rather than liquidating certain marketable securities  the company established a credit line with a financial institution and borrowed approximately million 
the interest rate on this line approximately half of what marketable securities are earning for the company plus similar short term financing in the european subsidiaries increased interest expense during fiscal year the company also incurred interest expense on the financing arrangement for the leaseback of the us manufacturing facility and for certain deferred compensation payments 
with the conversion of the reit units  as described previously  the company will no longer record interest expense on the leaseback arrangement  thus  combined with the debt repayments  the company anticipates that interest expense in fiscal year will be substantially lower than that recorded in fiscal years and for the year ended april   other  net includes a million gain on the conversion of the reit units to reit stock  as described above 
see item properties and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this gain was offset by certain recurring  non operating expenses 
in fiscal year  other  net expense was  compared to net income of  in fiscal year the variances in this account were impacted primarily by costs and income recorded at the company s french subsidiary 
during fiscal year  this subsidiary incurred certain one time charges of approximately  whereas during fiscal year  the same subsidiary realized a gain of approximately  on the sale of a portion of real property and received a government agency subsidy of approximately  to support a development activity 
in future fiscal years  other  net will include annual amortization into income of the million deferred gain on the sale of its building 
using the straightline method over the remaining months of the initial leaseback period  the company will recognize approximately  of amortized income during fiscal year the company anticipates that in future years other items in this category will not be significant to pretax earnings 
income taxes the company is subject to taxation in several countries 
the statutory federal rates vary from in the united states to in europe 
the effective rate for the company for the year ended april  was  compared to in fiscal year and a benefit in fiscal year the effective rate is impacted by the income or loss of certain of the company s european and asian subsidiaries which are currently not taxed 
in addition  the company utilizes the availability of research and development tax credits in the united states to lower its tax rate 
in fiscal year  the company reversed certain tax liabilities which had been established in prior years to cover certain tax contingencies 
during fiscal year  the company s income tax returns were examined by the internal revenue service and no changes were required for the years under audit 
accordingly  the tax liabilities established for the audited years are no longer required and the reversal of such tax liabilities were recorded as a tax benefit in fiscal year in fiscal year  the effective tax rate was impacted by the non deductibility of goodwill impairment

in fiscal year  cash was absorbed primarily during the first half of the fiscal year as the company s european subsidiaries recorded operating losses and the company made working capital investments in the operations of newly acquired fei zyfer to enable it to return to profitability 
with increasing sales in the second half of fiscal year  the company realized net inflows of cash but these were not sufficient to overcome the larger outlays in the earlier part of the year

the company must annually repay any borrowings under the line of credit on their anniversary date but may also obtain new funding up to the credit limit 
in addition  the company s european subsidiaries have available approximately million in bank credit lines to meet short term cash flow requirements 
the rate of interest on these borrowings is based on the one month euro interbank offered rate euribor 
during fiscal year  the company repaid all outstanding debt balances such that  as of april   no amounts were outstanding under any lines of credit 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year was million

the principal source of funds was short term financing from financial institutions in the amount of million

the company will continue to use treasury shares to satisfy the future exercise of stock options granted to officers and employees 
the company has been authorized by its board of directors to repurchase up to million worth of shares of its common stock for treasury whenever appropriate opportunities arise but it has neither a formal repurchase plan nor commitments to purchase additional shares in the future 
the company will continue to expend resources to develop and improve products for wireless and wireline communication systems which management believes will result in future growth and continued profitability 
during fiscal year  the company intends to make a substantial investment of capital and technical resources to develop new products to meet the needs of the us government  commercial space and commercial communications marketplaces and to invest in more efficient product designs and manufacturing procedures 
where possible  the company will secure partial customer funding for such development efforts but is targeting to spend its own funds at a rate of approximately of revenues to achieve its development goals

recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued statement no 
inventory costs 
fas this statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing and removes the so abnormal criterion that under certain circumstances could have led to the capitalization of these items 
fas requires that idle facility expense  excess spoilage  double freight and re handling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
fas also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead expenses to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after june   ie  fiscal year for the company 
the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  stock based payment fas r 
fas r supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in fas fas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
fas r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to fas r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after june   ie  fiscal year for the company 
the adoption of fas r will have an impact on the company s financial position and results of operations similar to the pro forma disclosure in the equity based compensation disclosure in note to the accompanying financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 exchange of non monetary assets  fas an amendment of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  which differed from the international accounting standards board s iasb method of accounting for exchanges of similar productive assets 
fas replaces the exception from fair value measurement in apb  with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the statement is to be applied prospectively and is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   ie  august  for the company 
the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or result of operations 
other matters the financial information reported herein is not necessarily indicative of future operating results or of the future financial condition of the company 
except as noted  management is unaware of any impending transactions or events that are likely to have a material adverse effect on results from operations 
inflation during fiscal  as in the two prior fiscal years  the impact of inflation on the company s business has not been materially significant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and market values of securities 
the company s investments in fixed income and equity securities were million and million  respectively  at april  the investments are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  recorded as adjustments to stockholders equity 
the fair value of investments in marketable securities is generally based on quoted market prices 
typically  the fair market value of investments in fixed interest rate debt securities will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at april   a change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed income securities or results of operations investment income 
foreign currency risk with its investment in gillam fei  fei europe and fei asia  the company is subject to foreign currency translation risk 
for each of these investments  the company does not have any near term intentions to repatriate its invested cash 
for this reason  the company does not intend to initiate any exchange rate hedging strategies which could be used to mitigate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations will be recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income 
as of april   the amount related to foreign currency exchange rates is a  unrealized gain 
note that the value of the chinese yuan is pegged to the value of the us dollar 
accordingly  no foreign currency gains or losses have been realized or are included in the unrealized gain indicated above 
if the chinese government decides to change its policy and permits the yuan to float against other world currencies  the company would report the effect in other comprehensive income  as appropriate 
the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars  will reflect the average rates of exchange for the periods presented 
as a result  similar results in local currency can vary significantly upon translation into us dollars if exchange rates fluctuate significantly from one period to the next
