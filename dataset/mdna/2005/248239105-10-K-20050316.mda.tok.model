executive overview we provide a broad array of solutions worldwide that enable pharmaceutical and other life science companies to strategically optimize their sales and marketing channels and clinical resources 
our plan is to continue to diversify and expand our solutions portfolio  customer base and geographic reach by leveraging our extensive knowledge of the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries and capitalizing upon our deep relationships in these industries 
our strategy continues to rely on both internal growth and acquisitions to meet to our growth objectives 
in january  we broadened and enhanced our product and service portfolio in the japanese pharmaceutical industry and extended our leadership position in japan with our acquisition of uto brain co 
ltd 
uto brain 
in april  we acquired the medical data management group of companies mdm  increasing our ability to provide leading solutions that drive promotional and sales effectiveness in central and eastern europe 
in january  we continued to broaden and enhance our service portfolio with our acquisition of buzzeopmda  inc buzzeo 
buzzeo s results of operations are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe our recent acquisitions complement our existing business operations by enhancing our solutions portfolio and increasing our access to new customers and markets 
we have expanded both our portfolio of solutions and customer base and believe that this combination presents significant opportunity for future growth 
we have also committed to investing in key initiatives to help drive future growth 
we believe increased investments in marketing and sales resources and programs will help us more effectively sell and market the diversity of solutions we now offer 
our future growth is dependent on our ability to further penetrate the markets in which we operate and increase the adoption rate of our expanded portfolio of solutions 
we evaluate our performance based upon a number of operating metrics 
chief among these metrics are revenues  operating margins  diluted net income per share  operating cash flow and days sales outstanding 
during  we saw the continued execution of our strategy yield growth in revenues  operating margins and diluted net income per share versus the same period of we also continued to exhibit strong cash generation attributes  improving days sales outstanding from the prior year end and generating strong positive operating cash flow even as we continued to reduce the remaining liabilities associated with our acquisitions 
in addition  seasonality has become a factor in certain lines of our business due to our international growth from our and acquisitions 
revenues are becoming increasingly stronger in the second and fourth quarters of a year compared to the first and third quarters 
due to the growth in our strategic product and service offerings  largely built through our recent acquisitions  we have expanded our revenue categories into sales solutions  marketing solutions and shipping 
these categories reflect how our service offerings are marketed to and viewed by our customers 
they are not reflective of the way we manage our business 
our operating costs are not broken out for these categories on a global basis  as they are not viewed as necessary in the management of our global business 
based upon all of these factors  while these categories are useful in understanding our operating results  we are only one reporting segment for disclosure purposes under statement of financial accounting standards sfas  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the following is a summary of our revenue categories sales solutions revenue includes product and sales solutions services of the traditional dendrite business 
all of these products and services are used by or provided to the sales force of our customers and sales management 
marketing solutions revenue includes our product and service offerings that are not geared toward the client sales force and primarily consists of offerings acquired in our business combinations over the past few years 
the primary components of marketing revenue include interactive marketing  data  consulting and clinical services 
shipping revenues are disclosed separately as they are pass through costs that bear little to no margin  and are required to be included in revenues and costs based upon emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
these billable shipping transactions are primarily related to our interactive marketing activities 
management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  acquisitions and related accruals  impairments  income taxes and capitalized software 
revenue recognition the area of revenue recognition requires management s to make significant judgments and estimates 
aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  governs revenue recognition for arrangements that include software which is more than incidental to the arrangement 
under sop  if a sale of software includes services that are essential to the functionality of the software  then the software and essential services are to be accounted for using contract accounting as described in accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the determination of whether or not services are essential to the functionality of the software can differ from arrangement to arrangement and requires the use of significant judgment by management 
factors used in determining whether or not services are essential to the functionality may include whether or not physical changes are being made to the software s underlying source code  the complexity of software configuration services  the level of effort required to build interfaces  the overall relationship of the service fees to the license fees  the length of time expected to complete the services  and whether or not the services can be obtained by a customer from their internal resources or another third party vendor 
if services are not considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  sop generally allows companies to recognize revenue for software licenses upon delivery of the licenses  prior to configuration or implementation services  provided that the other requirements of the sop are met 
in management s judgment  our configuration and implementation services generally are essential to the functionality of our software 
therefore  we typically recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method as detailed in sop the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires us to use significant estimates in measuring the progress to completion for each project 
for our license fee and implementation service projects  we use the input measure of labor incurred as compared with total expected labor for the entire project 
the determination of total project labor requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
we review these estimates on a monthly basis 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which would impact the amount of revenue previously recognized  had better estimates been available at the time 
many of our arrangements include multiple deliverables 
in the absence of higher level specific authoritative guidance  we determine the units of accounting for multiple element arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
specifically  we will consider a delivered item as a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered element  delivery or performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and is substantially within our control 
the determination of whether or not arrangements meet these criteria requires significant judgment on the part of the management 
if our arrangements did not meet the separation criteria of eitf  the timing of revenue recognition could be delayed 
accounting for acquisitions and related accruals the accounting related to business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value and useful life of the assets acquired and the fair value of the liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
we typically analyze a number of factors such as valuation or appraisal reports when determined the estimates of fair value 
should actual use of assets or resolution of obligations differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated fair values  useful lives  or both  would be required 
during  in connection with the purchase accounting related to the synavant acquisition  we established certain accruals related to costs that we expect will be incurred in connection with exiting multiple former synavant facilities and eliminating certain former synavant positions 
these accruals were based on estimates made at the time of acquisition 
the liability accrued for expenses to be incurred in exiting certain synavant facilities includes assumptions related to sublease income which offsets future lease obligations 
the underlying subleases are not in place for all facilities and the future placement of subleases  including the timing and terms and conditions of subleases  could be different than our assumptions 
accounting for impairments we review long lived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the recoverability of the long lived assets by estimating future undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the long lived asset 
if this estimate of future undiscounted cash flows demonstrates that recoverability is not probable  an impairment loss would be calculated and recognized based on the excess carrying value of the long lived asset over the long lived asset s fair value 
the estimate of the fair value and the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying long lived assets are based on significant judgments and assumptions 
we review capitalized software development costs and purchased capitalized software development costs for impairment at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product is greater than the net realizable value of that product 
in instances where the unamortized capitalized costs are greater than the net realizable value  we record an impairment loss 
we assess goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for the possibility of impairment on an annual basis as of october of each year  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
on an annual basis  or when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we calculate and compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
we currently have only one reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill for our reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill were less than the carrying value of the goodwill  we recognize an impairment loss equal to such difference  not to exceed the carrying value in our consolidated statement of operations 
on an annual basis  or when we determine that the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we calculate and compare the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
if we deem the useful life to be no longer indefinite  after testing for impairment in accordance with the applicable rules stated above  we amortize the intangible asset over its remaining estimated useful life  following the pattern in which the expected benefits will be consumed or otherwise used up and we would continue to review for impairment in the future on an annual basis 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  all of which require our significant judgment 
we must believe it is more likely than not that the recorded net deferred tax asset will be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income of a specific nature prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards  capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the asset may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
in addition  we maintain reserves for certain tax items  which are included in income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
we periodically review these reserves to determine if adjustments to these balances are necessary 
accounting for capitalized software we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements  including sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product to be sold should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs  which includes directs costs of developing the product  should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility is considered to be reached when a product and program design has been completed or a working model of the software product has been completed 
our technical operations group reviews each project to determine when technological feasibility of a product is established 
mergers and acquisitions we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses that represent strategic enhancements to our operations 
such acquisition opportunities  if they arise  may involve the use of cash  equity and or debt instruments 
we have made the following acquisitions over the last three years schwarzeck on july   we completed the strategic acquisition of the capital stock of schwarzeck verlag gmbh schwarzeck

we accrued approximately  at june   for liabilities associated with the cost of completing the restructuring plan 
the components of this accrued liability were approximately  of severance costs for former synavant positions being eliminated and approximately  of costs to exit former synavant facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the liabilities related to the restructuring plan by approximately  based on our revised estimate of the total cost 
the components of the reduction to the accrued liability were approximately  for lower expected severance costs for former synavant positions being eliminated and approximately for lower costs to exit certain former synavant facilities 
this reduction was recorded by an adjustment within goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
during finalization of the purchase price allocation  we increased our restructuring accrual estimate by approximately  due to an adjustment of the total costs to exit certain former synavant facilities and recorded the corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the liability accrued for expenses incurred in exiting certain synavant facilities includes  assumptions related to sublease income which offsets future lease obligations 
the underlying subleases are not in place for all facilities and the future placement of subleases  including the timing and terms and conditions of subleases  could be different than the assumptions and impact future results of operations

sales solutions sales solutions revenues accounted for approximately of total revenues during the year ended december   and increased compared with the year ended december  license fee revenue  which account for approximately of sales solution revenues  increased over the prior year  largely due to multi county roll outs of our software products by large global pharmaceutical customers 
in  we saw a trend of clients negotiating larger regional or multi country deals 
sales solutions services in the united states declined by approximately  but included an increase in our ongoing solutions services which were more than offset by larger decreases in one time services related to client software rollouts in international sales solutions service fees increased versus the year ended december   primarily due to our recent acquisitions as well as services relating to multi country rollouts initiated by several large global pharmaceutical customers

provision for income taxes 
our estimated effective income tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in prior year 
the reduction in our effective tax rate resulted primarily from the decrease in the number of international subsidiaries generating taxable losses for which previously we could not take a benefit as well as the more favorable distribution of profits among countries with lower tax rates 
in addition  during we recognized a full valuation allowance on a net operating loss carryforward at one of our international subsidiaries in the amount of that increased the effective tax rate by approximately 
at december  and  there were approximately  and  respectively  of undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely 
if such earnings were remitted to us  the applicable united states federal income and foreign withholding taxes may be wholly or partially offset by foreign tax credits 
as a result  the determination of potential us income taxes on these undistributed earnings is not practicable at december  or the american jobs creation act the act was passed on october  the act provides for certain tax benefits including  but not limited to  those associated with the reinvestment of foreign earnings in the united states 
we are currently evaluating the act and may or may not benefit from such provisions 
for  we could elect under the act to apply an dividends received deduction against certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations  in which we are a us shareholder 
undistributed earnings being considered for potential repatriation could be as much as  historically  we have not provided for potential taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings as all of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings have been considered permanently reinvested

cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   and was primarily attributable to the payments made in connection with the synavant acquisition 
as anticipated  purchases of property and equipment increased for the year ended december  versus the comparable prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to the capital costs of the new corporate headquarters and the higher overall capital spending associated with our larger combined company offset by proceeds from the sale leaseback of furniture and equipment 
during  we expect capital spending in the range of approximately  to  primarily to support the infrastructure expansion as well as capital expenditures for our us consolidated hardware center during we review our capital expenditure program periodically and adjust it as required to meet current needs 
an agreement to sell the facility located in piscataway  new jersey  was terminated during the quarter ended june  during the third quarter of  we decided to move our new jersey hardware services to this facility 
accordingly  the  carrying value  which approximates the fair market value of the facility  has been reclassified to property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises partially offset by the repayments of long term debt and loans acquired in connection with the uto brain acquisition 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses complementary to our operations 
such acquisition opportunities  if they arise  may involve the use of cash  equity or debt instruments 
we believe that available funds  anticipated cash flows from operations and the availability of our revolving line of credit will satisfy our current projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements  exclusive of cash required for possible future acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  during the next twelve to eighteen months 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels or that anticipated operational improvements will be achieved 
our ability to generate future cash flows depends on our future performance and financial results  which  to a certain extent  are subject to general conditions in or affecting the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry and to general economic  political  financial  competitive and regulatory factors beyond our control 
contractual obligations and commitments we entered into a line of credit agreement the agreement as of june   in the amount of  with jpmorgan chase bank that expires on july  the agreement is available to finance working capital needs and possible future acquisitions 
among other covenants  the agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth  measured quarterly  which is equal to  plus of net income earned after april   and of the net proceeds of any offering of new equity interests issued subsequent to june  as of december   our consolidated net worth was  the agreement contains certain restrictions on our ability to create or assume liens  dispose of assets  consolidate or merge  extend credit  incur other indebtedness or pay cash dividends 
on september   we entered into an amendment to the agreement that changed certain covenants relating to acquisitions  dispositions of our assets  indebtedness of our foreign subsidiaries  real estate and capital expenditures in connection with our move to our new corporate headquarters facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and did not have any amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
we currently intend to renew or replace the agreement concurrent with its expiration 
our principal commitments at december  consisted primarily of obligations under operating and capital leases as well as future minimum guarantees to certain vendors 
future minimum payments on these obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter capital leases     corporate headquarters   minimum guarantees   uto brain purchase price   operating leases      total       operating lease amounts disclosed above include  of future operating lease costs  excluding estimated future sublease income  accrued for in the purchase accounting restructuring accruals related to the synavant and sai acquisitions 
as of december   letters of credit for approximately  were outstanding related to deposits on certain facilities 
we have an agreement with a venture capital fund with a commitment to contribute  to the fund  callable at the discretion of the general partner in increments 
as of december   has been paid  with of the commitment remaining 
the agreement has a termination date of december   subject to extension with the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners 
this asset is recorded within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
potential future impact on operating results of accounting change in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r as a replacement to sfas this statement supersedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees which allowed companies to use the intrinsic method of valuing share based payment transactions and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value method as defined in statement the effective date is at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  sfas r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under sfas no 
for the pro forma disclosure 
we plan to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
in addition  sfas r also requires that tax benefits received in excess of compensation cost be reclassified from operating cash flows to financing cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the adoption of fas r s fair value method is expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations  though it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosure in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that estimating the future impact of expensing stock options provides investors with useful information concerning our potential future operating results 
we estimate that the future pre tax expense relating to the fair value of stock options granted prior to and outstanding as of march   calculated using the black scholes valuation method  is approximately  for the year ending december   approximately  for the year ending december   approximately for the year ending december   and approximately for the year ending december  the decrease from to is primarily related to the higher strike prices of options vesting in as compared to  as well as the absolute number of options vesting in these estimates have been calculated using the black scholes valuation model  which is the method that we currently use in preparing our financial statement disclosures related to employee stock options 
the fair values of the options were estimated at the date of grant based on the following assumptions for the year ended december  as of march  expected dividend yield weighted average expected stock price volatility weighted average risk free interest rate expected life of the option years in addition  the expenses calculated above include an annually estimated forfeiture rate of approximately annually and do not take into account future stock option grants 
the estimated forfeiture rate disclosed above may not reflect actual forfeitures 
these amounts are preliminary estimates based on our current understanding of this new requirement and are subject to substantial variation based on the final interpretations and applications of these rules 
they are intended only to provide order of magnitude and should not be considered or relied upon as final estimates 
it is expected that we will grant future equity awards  which may be substantial and which could include awards in fiscal and subsequent years  and such equity awards would be expected to increase expense under sfas r 
factors that may affect future results set forth in this form k are certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this form k 
you are strongly urged to carefully consider the cautionary language and risks set forth below 
we depend on a few major customers for a significant portion of our revenues historically  a limited number of our customers have contributed a significant percentage of our revenues 
we anticipate that our operating results in any given period will continue to depend significantly upon revenues from a small number of customers 
the loss of any of these customers which could include loss through mergers and acquisitions could have a materially adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we cannot make any assurances that we will retain our existing customers or attract new customers that would replace the revenue that could be lost if one or more of these customers failed to renew its agreement s with us 
our business is heavily dependent on the pharmaceutical industry most of our solutions are currently used in connection with the marketing and sale of prescription only drugs 
this market is undergoing a number of significant changes 
these changes include the significant and continuing consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry which may reduce the number of our existing and potential customers  regulatory changes that permit the over the counter sale of formerly prescription only drugs  us and international governmental regulations mandating price controls  increasing food and drug administration activism  and competitive pressure on the pharmaceutical industry resulting from the continuing shift to delivery of healthcare and pharmaceuticals through managed care organizations 
we cannot assure you that we can respond effectively to any or all of these and other changes in the marketplace 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition  as our business depends  in large part  on the business conditions within this marketplace 
our customers may not successfully implement our products our customers often implement our products in stages and our products are often utilized by a large number of our customers personnel 
in the event that our customers have difficulties implementing our products and services or are not satisfied with the implementation or operation our products and services  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we face risks associated with our acquisitions our business may be materially and adversely affected as a result of the significant risks associated with our acquisitions  including our recent acquisitions of synavant  uto brain  the mdm group of companies and schwarzeck 
as part of our business strategy  we have acquired  and in the future may acquire  businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these acquisitions are accompanied by substantial risks  including unexpected problems  liabilities  risks or costs associated with the acquired business  the effect of the acquisitions on our financial and strategic position  our inability to successfully integrate the acquired business  the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies  our inability to achieve expected cost and business synergies  the significant strain on our operating systems  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  the impairment or loss of relationships with customers of the acquired business  the negative impact of the combination of different corporate cultures  the loss of key employees of the acquired company  undetected problems within the acquired organization  and the integration and maintenance of uniform  company wide standards  procedures and policies 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we expect that the consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  equity  debt or a combination of these 
to the extent that we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisition  existing shareholders will experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share 
while to date we have had success integrating acquired entities into our operations  we cannot guarantee that we will successfully integrate these new businesses into our operations or achieve any expected cost synergies 
we may in the future acquire additional complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we do so  we may face the same risks  uncertainties and disruptions discussed above 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs of acquired intangible assets 
business and economic pressures on our major customers may cause a decrease in demand for our new products and services business and economic pressures on our major customers may result in budget constraints that directly impact their ability to purchase our new products and services offerings 
we cannot assure you that any decrease in demand caused by these pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our lengthy sales and implementation cycles make it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues the selection of a crm or sfa solution generally entails an extended decision making process by our customers because of the strategic implications  substantial costs and significant commitment of resources associated with a customer s license or implementation of the solution 
given the importance of the decision  senior levels of management of our customers are often involved in the process and  in some instances  their board of directors may also be involved 
as a result  the decision making process typically takes nine to eighteen months  and in certain cases longer 
in addition  other factors  unrelated to our product and services  such as acquisitions  product delays  or other issues  may also significantly impact the timing and amounts of buying decisions 
accordingly  we cannot fully control or predict the timing of our execution of contracts with customers 
prior sales and implementation cycles cannot be relied upon as any indication of future cycles 
in addition  an implementation process of three to six or more months before the software is rolled out to a customer s sales force is customary 
however  if a customer were to delay or extend its implementation process  our quarterly revenues may decline below expected levels and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate our total revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the main factors that could cause these fluctuations are the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles  potential delays in recognizing revenue from license and other transactions  seasonal variations in operating results  including the increased seasonality associated with our international growth  and variations in the fiscal or quarterly cycles of our customers 
in addition  we establish our expenditure levels for product development  sales and marketing and some of our other operating expenses based in large part on our expected future revenues and anticipated competitive conditions 
in particular  we frequently add staff in advance of new business to permit adequate time for training 
if the new business is subsequently delayed  canceled or not awarded  we will have incurred expenses without the associated revenues 
we also may increase sales and marketing expenses if competitive pressures become greater than originally anticipated 
since only a small portion of our expenses varies directly with our actual revenues  our operating results and profitability are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected if our revenues fall below our targeted goals or expectations 
as a result of these and other factors  revenues for any quarter may be subject to fluctuation 
you should not rely on our period to period comparisons of our results of operations as indications of future performance 
our future quarterly results may from time to time not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  which could have a materially adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we may be unable to successfully introduce new products or respond to technological change the market for crm and sfa products changes rapidly because of frequent improvements in computer hardware and software technology 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use available technologies and data sources to develop new products and services and to enhance our current products and services  introduce new solutions that keep pace with developments in our target markets  and address the changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements that respond to technological advances in the marketplace  or that we will do so in a timely fashion 
we also cannot assure you that our products will adequately and competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
competition for software products has been characterized by shortening product cycles 
we may be materially and adversely affected by this trend if the product cycles for our products prove to be shorter than we anticipate 
if that happens  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 
to remain competitive  we also may have to spend more of our resources on product research and development than we have in the past 
as a result  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
software errors or defects could affect our revenues our software products are technologically complex and may contain previously undetected errors or failures or errors when products are first introduced or when updated versions are released 
we cannot assure you that  despite our testing  our new products will be free from significant errors 
software errors could cause delays in the commercial release of products until the errors have been corrected 
software errors may cause us to be in breach of our agreements with customers  which could result in termination of the agreements and monetary damages 
software errors may cause damage to our reputation and cause us to commit significant resources to their correction 
errors that result in termination of agreements  monetary damages  losses or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services solutions there are a number of other companies that sell crm and sfa products and related services that specifically target the pharmaceutical industry  including competitors that are actively selling crm and sfa software products in more than one country and competitors that also offer crm and sfa support services 
some of our competitors and potential competitors are part of large corporate groups and have significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technology and other resources than we have 
while we believe that the crm and sfa software products and or services offered by most of our competitors do not address the variety of pharmaceutical customer needs that our solutions address  increased competition may require us to reduce the prices for our products and services 
increased competition may also result in decreased demand for our products and services 
we believe our ability to compete depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the number and success of new market entrants supplying competing crm and sfa products or support services  alliances among existing competitors  technological changes or changes in the our customers use of the internet  expansion of product lines by  or consolidation among  our existing competitors  and development and or operation of in house crm or sfa software products or services by our customers and potential customers 
any one of these factors can lead to price reductions and or decreased demand and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the internet related products and services market nor can we provide assurances that the demand for internet related products and services will increase the success of parts of our business will depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing internet related products  modifying and improving our existing products and responding to technological advances and changing commercial uses of the internet 
we cannot assure you that our internet related products and services will adequately respond to such technological advances and changing uses 
nor can we assure you that the demand for our internet related products and services will increase 
commercial use of the internet raises potential problems with security  privacy  reliability  accessibility  quality of service and government regulation 
these issues  if unresolved  may affect the use of our internet related products 
if these potential problems arise  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations have risks that our domestic operations do not we have recently significantly expanded and may in the future further expand our international operations and enter additional international markets 
this expansion would require significant management attention and financial resources that could adversely affect operating margins and earnings 
we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products and services 
if we do not  our international sales will be limited and our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the sale of our products and services in foreign countries accounts for  and is expected in the future to account for  an increasing material part of our revenues 
these sales are subject to substantial risks inherent in international business activities  including adverse changes in the political stability and economic environments in these countries and regions  adverse changes in tax  tariff and trade and other regulations  the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights in certain of these countries  and difficulties in managing an organization spread on a global basis 
each of the above risks could have a significant impact on our revenues  profitability and our ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
since we have operations in a number of countries and our service agreements in such countries are denominated in foreign currencies  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency rates change  translation of the income statements of our international entities from local currencies to us dollars affects period over period comparability of operating results 
historically  we have not hedged these translation risks because we generally reinvest our cash flows from international operations 
however  we continue to evaluate foreign currency translation risk exposure 
as we continue to grow our international business  the risks associated with foreign currency translation will also grow 
catastrophic events could negatively affect our information technology infrastructure the efficient operation of our business  and ultimately our operating performance  depends on the uninterrupted use of our critical business and information technology systems 
many of these systems require the use of specialized hardware and other equipment that is not readily available in the marketplace 
although we maintain these systems at more than one location  a natural disaster  a fire or other catastrophic event at any of these locations could result in the destruction of these systems 
in such an event  the replacement of these systems and restoration of archived data and normal operation of our business could take several days to several weeks  or more 
during the intervening period when our critical business and information technology systems are fully or partially inoperable  our ability to conduct normal business operations could be significantly and adversely impacted and as a result our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our success depends on retaining our key senior management team and on attracting and retaining qualified personnel our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the contributions of our executive officers and key sales  technical and customer service personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
due to competition for such personnel  we have at times experienced difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and we may experience such difficulties in the future 
our ability to expand and increase revenue growth in the future will depend  in part  on our success in recruiting and training such qualified personnel 
we may not always be able to expand our personnel in these areas as necessary to support our operations 
any recruiting or retention difficulties could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to a customer s data  certain of our solutions may be perceived as being insecure and customers may curtail or stop using our service 
certain of our solutions involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  litigation and potential liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
our business depends on proprietary rights that we may not be able to protect completely we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure  license and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot assure you that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of these rights 
further  protective actions we have taken or will take in the future may not prevent competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
in response to customer requests  we have also on occasion entered into agreements which require us to place our source code in escrow to secure our service and maintenance obligations 
further  while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future that may result in costly litigation  diversion of management s attention  the imposition of monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 
in addition  any such claims may require us to enter into royalty arrangements 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
if our third party vendors are unable to successfully respond to technological change or if we do not maintain our relationships with third party vendors  interruptions in the supply of our products may result some of our software is provided by third party vendors 
if our third party vendors are unable to successfully respond to technological change or if our relationships with certain third party vendors are terminated  we may experience difficulty in replacing the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products 
although we believe there are other sources for all of our third party software  any significant interruption in the supply of these products could adversely impact our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of functionality provided by third party software in our products could materially and adversely affect our sales 
the results derived from current and future strategic relationships may prove to be less favorable than anticipated we are involved in a number of strategic relationships with third parties and are frequently pursuing others 
should these relationships  or any of them  prove to be more costly than anticipated or fail to meet revenue expectations or other anticipated synergies  we cannot guarantee that such events will not have a material impact upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
our data solutions are dependent upon strategic relationships which  if not maintained  could undermine the continued viability of these solutions our data and analytics solutions are sourced  in part  from data provided through strategic relationships 
although we believe there are other sources for such data  the termination of any of these relationships could diminish the breadth or depth of our data 
this termination or our failure to establish new strategic relationships in the future could negatively impact our business  operating results or financial condition 
federal and state laws and regulations could depress the demand for some of our solutions while we believe our data and analytics solutions are not in violation of current federal or state laws and regulations pertaining to patient privacy or health information  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  we cannot guarantee that future laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws and statutes will not impact negatively upon our ability to market these solutions or cause a decrease in demand for such solutions from customers that see an increased risk in any such new laws or regulations 
governmental regulation may materially and adversely affect our ability to distribute controlled substances through the mail through the interactive marketing business we acquired in the synavant acquisition  we may distribute controlled substances to doctors offices through the mail as part of certain interactive marketing programs provided on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers 
it is important to the business that this practice of distributing prescription only drugs continues 
future legislation may restrict our ability to provide these types of services 
if any such legislation is enacted  it could have a material and adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
difficulties in subleasing or otherwise disposing of certain of our facilities may negatively impact upon our earnings we expect to sublease all or a portion of certain facilities  including facilities acquired as part of the synavant acquisition 
an inability to successfully dispose of or sublet  as applicable  any of these facilities or to obtain favorable pricing or sublease terms could negatively impact our earnings 
unanticipated changes in our accounting policies may be required because of mandates by accounting standards setting organizations and could have a material impact on our financial statements in reporting our financial results we rely upon the accounting policies and standards then in effect at the time of our report 
future regulations  standards or interpretations may require us to adjust or restate financial results previously reported 
a required restatement could have a material impact upon past financial results or current comparison to previous results 
we may face risks associated with events which may affect the world economy world events such as terrorist attacks  the current us military action in the middle east and elsewhere  and hostilities in the middle east  asia and other geographical areas  have and may in the future weaken the us and world economies 
any resultant weaknesses in these economies may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or the businesses of our customers 
we face risks in connection with implementing the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act we have been engaged in a very lengthy and time consuming process of evaluating our internal control over financial reporting in order to allow management to report on  and our registered independent public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
this is a continuing process and we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our future reviews  evaluation  testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations or the results of the required testing and required attestation report by us and also by our registered independent public accounting firm 
if at any time we are unable to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the securities and exchange commission or nasdaq 
any such actions could have a material adverse affect our financial results and the price of our common stock 
provisions of our charter documents and new jersey law may discourage an acquisition of dendrite provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our by laws  as amended  and new jersey law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
for example  the board of directors may  without the consent of the stockholders  issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock 
in addition  we have a shareholder rights plan which may limit the ability of a third party to attempt a hostile acquisition of the company 
our common stock may be subject to price fluctuations the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors the announcement or the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results or changes in revenue or earnings estimates or failure to meet or exceed revenue or earnings estimates  market conditions in the technology  healthcare and other growth sectors  general consolidation in the healthcare information industry which may result in the market perceiving us or other comparable companies as potential acquisition targets  the gain or loss of significant orders  changes in the domestic and international economic  political and business conditions  and future acquisitions 
further  the stock market has experienced on occasion extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies have been especially volatile and often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk because we have operations in a number of countries and our service agreements in such countries are denominated in a foreign currency  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency rates change  translation of the income statements of our international entities from local currencies to us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
historically  we have not hedged translation risks because we generally reinvest our cash flows from international operations 
however  we continue to evaluate foreign currency translation risk exposure 
management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted reported operating profit by approximately  this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one area may be offset by gains from another area 
as we continue to grow our international businesses  the risks associated with foreign currency translation will also grow 
interest rate risk we earn interest income from our balances of cash and short term investments 
this interest income is subject to market risk related to changes in interest rates  which primarily affects our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased approximately this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments and future changes in investment yields
