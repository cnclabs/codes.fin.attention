item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview generation of revenue  income and cash our automotive sector s revenue  income and cash are generated primarily from sales of vehicles to our dealers and distributors ie  our customers 
vehicles we produce generally are subject to firm orders from our customers and generally are deemed sold with the proceeds from such sale recognized in revenue immediately after they are produced and shipped to our customers 
this is not the case  however  with respect to vehicles produced for sale to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option or vehicles produced for use in our own fleet including management evaluation vehicles 
vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option are accounted for as operating leases  with lease revenue and profits recognized over the term of the lease 
when we sell the vehicle at auction  we recognize a gain or loss on the difference  if any  between actual auction value and the projected auction value 
therefore  except for the impact of the daily rental units sold subject to a guaranteed repurchase option and those units placed into our own fleet  vehicle production is closely linked with unit sales and revenue from such sales 
most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by ford credit 
upon ford credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer s purchase of a vehicle  ford credit pays cash to the relevant legal entity in our automotive sector in payment of the dealer s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle 
the dealer then pays off the wholesale finance receivable when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer 
see note of the notes to the financial statements 
our financial services sector s revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables  net of certain deferred loan origination costs that are included as a reduction of financing revenue  and such revenue is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method 
also  revenue from operating leases  net of certain deferred origination costs  is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
income is generated to the extent revenues exceed expenses  most of which are interest and operating expenses 
transactions between the automotive and financial services sectors occur in the ordinary course of business 
for example  ford credit receives interest supplements and other support cost payments from the automotive sector in connection with special vehicle financing and leasing programs that it sponsors 
ford credit records these payments as revenue over the term of the related finance receivable or operating lease 
the automotive sector records the estimated costs of marketing incentives  including dealer and retail customer cash payments eg  rebates and costs of special financing and leasing programs  as a reduction to revenue at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated 
key economic factors and trends affecting automotive industry excess capacity 
according to csm worldwide  an automotive research firm  in the estimated automotive industry global production capacity for light vehicles about million units significantly exceeded global production of cars and trucks about million units 
in north america and europe  the two regions where the majority of revenue and profits are earned in the industry  excess capacity was an estimated and  respectively 
csm worldwide projects that excess capacity conditions could continue for several more years 
pricing pressure 
excess capacity  coupled with a proliferation of new products being introduced in key segments by the industry  will keep pressure on manufacturers ability to increase prices on their products 
in addition  the incremental new capacity in the united states by foreign manufacturers so called transplants in recent years has contributed  and is likely to continue to contribute  to the severe pricing pressure in that market 
in the united states  the reduction of real item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued prices for similarly contented vehicles has become more pronounced since the late s  and we expect that a challenging pricing environment will continue for some time to come 
in europe  the automotive industry also has experienced intense pricing pressure for several years for the same reasons discussed above  which has been exacerbated in recent years as a result of the block exemption regulation discussed above in item business automotive sector europe 
consumer spending trends 
we expect  however  that a decline in  or the inability to increase  vehicle prices could be offset by the spending habits of consumers and their propensity to purchase over time higher end  more expensive vehicles and or vehicles with more features 
over the next decade  in the united states and in other mature markets  we expect that growth in spending on vehicle mix and content will grow at least as fast as real gdp per capita 
the benefits of this to revenue growth in the automotive industry are significant 
in the united states  for example  consumers in the highest income bracket are buying more often and are more frequently buying upscale 
although growth in vehicle unit sales ie  volume will be greatest in emerging markets in the next decade  we expect that the mature automotive markets eg  north america  western europe and japan will continue to be the source of a substantial majority of global industry revenues over the next decade 
we also expect that the north american market will continue as the single largest source of revenue for the automotive industry in the world in the next decade 
health care expenses 
as a provider of health care coverage to our employees  retirees and their dependents  primarily in the united states  we have experienced significant health care inflation in the last few years 
in  our health care expenses for us employees  retirees and their dependents were billion  with about billion attributable to retirees and the balance attributable to active employees 
prescription drug cost continues as the fastest growing segment of our health care expenses and accounted for about one third of our total us health care expenses in although we have taken measures to have employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits  we expect our health care costs to increase 
for  our trend assumptions for us health care costs include an initial trend rate of  gradually declining to a steady state trend rate of reached in these assumptions include the effect of actions we are taking and expect to take to offset health care inflation  including eligibility management  employee education and wellness  competitive sourcing and appropriate employee cost sharing 
commodity price increases 
commodity price increases  particularly for steel and resins which are used extensively in the automotive industry  have occurred recently and are continuing during a period of strong global demand for these materials 
manufacturers in china and other global steelmakers have responded through increases in capacity and production of steel 
we expect this  coupled with an easing in global demand pressures  to result in pricing trends beginning to moderate in the intermediate term 
currency exchange rate volatility 
the us dollar depreciated against most major currencies in this created downward margin pressure on auto manufacturers that have us dollar revenue with foreign currency cost 
because we produce vehicles in europe eg  jaguar  land rover and volvo models for sale in the united states and produce components in europe eg  engines for use in some of our north american vehicles  ford experienced margin pressure  although this was partially offset by gains on foreign exchange derivatives 
ford  like most other automotive manufacturers with sales in the united states  is not always able to price for depreciation of the us dollar due to the extremely competitive pricing environment in the united states 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued trends and strategies revenue management 
to address the pricing pressure that exists in the automotive industry  we have employed a customer focused revenue management strategy to maximize per unit revenue 
this strategy is focused on a disciplined approach to utilizing customer demand data available from many sources  including internet hits  transaction data  customer leads  and research to help us develop and sell vehicles that more closely match customer desires 
we believe our revenue management strategy has contributed significantly to increases in our average net revenue per vehicle sold for our ford north america business unit of and for and  respectively 
since  our average net revenue per vehicle sold in north america has improved by over  on a cumulative basis 
this improvement reflected positive net pricing  as well as a more favorable product mix 
market share 
an ongoing challenge in the current automotive industry is balancing market share with profitability 
due to the excess industry capacity  most manufacturers engage in some amount of price discounting to increase  maintain or limit decreases in their respective market shares 
in the last few years  we have implemented a strategy of de emphasizing less profitable sales to daily rental car companies  which typically are associated with a large amount of discounting  and placing greater emphasis on our share of the retail market ie  market share among end use customers 
this strategy benefits us by reducing the overall amount of marketing incentives we incur and improving the auction and resale values of our products 
this latter benefit  in turn  has the added benefit of reducing depreciation expense for vehicles in ford credit s vehicle lease portfolio 
the strategy to de emphasize sales to daily rental car companies  while contributing to improved profits  also has contributed to a loss of share in the united states 
product differentiation and innovation 
the fundamental requirement for success in the automotive business is having products with great appeal  whether in terms of styling  quality  innovative features  breakthrough technology or a combination of those characteristics 
our strategy for product creation includes a strong focus on new technology 
this is not  however  limited to developing and introducing breakthrough vehicle technologies  but also can be applied to the total vehicle package 
for example  our new ford f pick up truck  first introduced as a model  utilizes more than patented inventions related to performance  utility and styling 
this model helped establish a sales record for f series pick up trucks in with nearly one million units sold 
other differentiating technologies that we have introduced or are working to introduce for general availability are hybrid powertrains  which use a combination of electric power  generated from onboard batteries that are recharged while driving the vehicle  and a gasoline internal combustion engine 
the ford escape hybrid  introduced as a model  is an example of this technology  and we plan to offer four additional vehicle models with this technology 
other alternative fuel vehicles  such as hydrogen powered internal combustion engines  bio or clean diesel powered vehicles and fuel cells 
we believe we are the only automobile manufacturer doing significant development work on all these alternative fuel technologies  as well as hybrid powertrain technologies 
roll stability control tm system  which is a computer controlled system that detects vehicle roll and automatically controls the vehicle to prevent it from rolling over 
this is currently standard equipment or is available as an option on most of our suvs 
all aluminum bodies  which reduce the weight of the vehicle  compared with steel bodies  thereby increasing vehicle fuel economy and performance 
the current version of the jaguar xj  first introduced as a model  is an example of a vehicle with this technology 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost reductions 
given the difficult competitive environment of the automotive industry  we continue to focus on reducing our cost structure 
during and  we reduced our costs by million and billion  respectively at constant volume  mix and exchange and excluding special items and discontinued operations 
for  we expect costs for pensions and health care  commodities  and depreciation and amortization will increase  compared with we expect quality related costs ie  those related to warranty claims and additional service actions in to be about the same as they were in in  we expect to achieve reduced manufacturing  engineering and overhead costs  as well as significant savings in product costs which comprise material and component costs for our vehicles  compared with overall  we expect our costs in will be about the same as they were in at constant volume  mix and exchange and excluding special items and discontinued operations 
shared technologies 
one of the strategies we are employing to realize efficiencies in manufacturing  engineering and product costs for new vehicles is to share vehicle architectures  technologies and components among various models and re use them from one generation of a vehicle model to the next 
this is illustrated in our recently launched ford five hundred and mercury montego car models  which are by value common  and the ford freestyle cross over model  which shares by value of the components used in those aforementioned models 
in addition  the architecture for all three of these vehicles is derived from an existing architecture 
business improvement actions ford europe improvement plan 
in october  we announced that we were taking actions to improve efficiency resulting from our flexible manufacturing capability by concentrating production of the next generation of our ford focus model in two assembly plants rather than three 
this plan included canceling investment for the focus model at our genk  belgium plant 
in addition  it included revising production for our ford mondeo model at genk to a shift rather than shift pattern beginning in january these genk actions  together with a series of manufacturing  engineering and staff efficiency actions at various other locations in europe  all of which comprised the ford europe improvement plan  were expected to reduce personnel levels by  and result in pre tax charges of million  including million in during  we completed the planned ford europe improvement actions  the associated pre tax charges totaled million 
including the results of these actions  ford europe has reduced total personnel levels by more than  since mid pag improvement plan 
in september  we announced that we were taking actions to improve the structure of our premier automotive group pag business unit 
these actions included closing the final assembly operations at our browns lane plant in coventry  england  where jaguar xj and xk models are produced  and reducing salaried staffing levels at our jaguar and land rover operations 
we estimated at that time that we would incur pre tax charges and cash expenditures of about million for employee separation costs 
our results include million of these costs and we expect to incur million in associated with the shutdown of the final assembly operations at browns lane 
these actions reduced our personnel levels by  in  with further personnel reductions in expected to be about in addition  we decided to exit formula one racing and to sell our formula one racing operations  which incurred pre tax operating losses of million in the first nine months of we sold the operations in the fourth quarter of for a further discussion of the disposition of our formula one racing operations  see note of the notes to the financial statements 
revitalization plan 
one of the elements of our revitalization plan  which we announced and began implementing in january  included a reduction of maximum installed assembly capacity for north american vehicles of over  units down from million units in to an ongoing level of approximately million units 
through  including the closure of our ontario truck item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued plant and edison plant  maximum installed capacity will have been reduced by over  units 
plans through including closure of our lorain  ohio assembly plant will achieve further net reductions of approximately  units  resulting in a total net reduction of about  units 
the revitalization plan also included a global reduction of more than  personnel by  including selected actions prior to progress towards this target is measured by excluding employees of entities recently consolidated pursuant to financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin  discussed in note of the notes to the financial statements  as well as personnel associated with divested and newly acquired operations the latter of which would represent a net reduction of  personnel through year end if included in the measurement

ford credit the increase in income before income taxes of  million primarily reflected improved credit loss performance and improved leasing results 
the improved credit loss performance primarily resulted from fewer repossessions and a lower average loss per repossession 
the improvement in leasing results primarily reflected higher used vehicle prices and a reduction in the percentage of vehicles returned to ford credit at lease termination 
ford credit reviews its business performance from several perspectives  including on balance sheet basis includes the receivables ford credit owns and receivables sold for legal purposes that remain on ford credit s balance sheet  securitized off balance sheet basis includes receivables sold in securitization transactions that are not reflected on ford credit s balance sheet  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued managed basis includes on balance sheet and securitized off balance sheet receivables that ford credit continues to service  and serviced basis includes managed receivables and receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions where ford credit retains no interest in the sold receivables  but which it continues to service 
ford credit analyzes its financial performance primarily on an on balance sheet and managed basis 
it retains interests in receivables sold in off balance sheet securitizations  and with respect to subordinated retained interests  has credit risk 
as a result  it evaluates credit losses  receivables and leverage on a managed basis as well as on an on balance sheet basis 
in contrast  ford credit does not have the same financial interest in the performance of receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions  and as a result it generally reviews the performance of the serviced portfolio only to evaluate the effectiveness of its origination and collection activities 
to evaluate the performance of these activities  ford credit monitors a number of measures  such as repossession statistics  losses on repossessions and the number of bankruptcy filings

in addition  at december   interests in operating leases and the related vehicles of about billion have been transferred for legal purposes to consolidated securitization spes 
these receivables and interests in operating leases and the related vehicles are available only for repayment of debt issued by those entities  and to pay other securitization investors and other participants  they are not available to pay ford credit s other obligations or the claims of ford credit s other creditors 
securitized off balance sheet receivables 
total securitized off balance sheet receivables decreased billion from a year ago 
managed receivables 
total managed receivables decreased billion from a year ago 
the decrease primarily reflected lower retail and operating lease contract placement volumes 
the lower level of managed receivables reflected ford credit s continued focus on financing ford brand vehicles 
the following table shows actual credit losses net of recoveries  which are referred to as charge offs  for ford credit s worldwide on balance sheet  reacquired  securitized off balance sheet and managed receivables  for the various categories of financing during the periods indicated 
reacquired receivables reflect the amount of receivables that resulted from the accounting consolidation of fcar owner trust fcar in the second quarter of the loss to receivables ratios  which equal charge offs divided by the average amount of net receivables outstanding for the period  are shown for the on balance sheet and managed portfolios

in  charge offs for ford credit s on balance sheet and its securitized off balance sheet receivables declined from a year ago primarily reflecting fewer repossessions and a lower average loss per repossession in its us retail installment and operating lease portfolio 
these improvements resulted from ford credit s emphasis on purchasing higher quality retail installment and lease contracts and enhancements to its collection practices 
the on balance sheet loss to receivables ratio decreased primarily reflecting improvements in charge offs as described above

the decrease in the allowance for credit losses of approximately million primarily reflected significantly improved charge off performance in the united states  specifically fewer repossessions and a lower average loss per repossession in the ford  lincoln and mercury brand us retail installment sale and operating lease portfolio 
ford credit s emphasis on purchasing higher quality receivables  enhancements to its collection practices and higher used vehicle prices resulted in a reduction in net charge offs and the associated provision for credit losses 
the following table summarizes the activity related to off balance sheet sales of receivables reported as revenues for the periods indicated in millions except for ratios over under net gain on sales of receivables income on interest in sold wholesale receivables and retained securities servicing fees income from residual interest and other investment and other income related to sales of receivables less whole loan income income related to off balance sheet securitizations memo finance receivables sold servicing portfolio as of period end pre tax gain per dollar of retail receivables sold pts the decrease in investment and other income related to sales of receivables reflected lower levels of outstanding sold receivables compared with sales of finance receivables through off balance sheet securitizations have the impact on earnings of recalendarizing and reclassifying net financing margin ie  financing revenue less interest expense and credit losses related to the sold receivables  compared with how they would have been reported if ford credit continued to report the sold receivables on balance sheet and funded them through asset backed financings 
recalendarization effects occur initially when the gain or loss on sales of receivables is recognized in the period the receivables are sold 
over the life of the securitization item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued transaction  ford credit recognizes income from residual interest in securitization transactions  interest income from retained securities  servicing fees and other receivable sale income 
in addition  credit losses related to the off balance sheet securitized receivables are included in the initial and ongoing valuation of ford credit s residual interest in the securitization transaction see off balance sheet arrangements sales of receivables by ford credit for definition and neither impact the provision for credit and insurance losses on the income statement nor influence the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses related to ford credit s on balance sheet receivables 
therefore  over the life of each off balance sheet securitization transaction  the gain or loss on sale of receivables  income from residual interest in securitization transactions  interest income from retained securities  servicing fees and other receivable sale income is equal to the net financing margin and credit losses that would have been reported had ford credit reported the receivables on its balance sheet and funded them through asset backed financings 
the net impact of off balance sheet securitizations on ford credit s earnings in a given period will vary depending on the amount and type of receivables sold and the timing of the transactions in the current period and the preceding two to three year period  as well as the interest rate environment at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized 
the following table shows  on an analytical basis  the earnings impact of off balance sheet securitizations as if ford credit had reported them as on balance sheet and funded them through asset backed financings for the periods indicated in millions over under financing revenue retail revenue wholesale revenue total financing revenue borrowing cost net financing margin credit losses income before income taxes memo income related to off balance sheet securitizations recalendarization impact of off balance sheet securitizations in  the impact on earnings of reporting the sold receivables as off balance sheet securitizations was million lower than had these transactions been structured as on balance sheet securitizations 
this difference resulted from recalendarization effects caused by gain on sale accounting requirements  as discussed above 
this effect will fluctuate as the amount of receivables sold in ford credit s off balance sheet securitizations increases or decreases over time 
in a steady state of securitization activity  the difference between reporting securitizations on or off balance sheet in a particular year approaches zero 
while the difference in earnings impact between on or off balance sheet securitizations is minimal  this funding source has provided ford credit with significant borrowing cost savings compared with unsecured debt and funding flexibility in a difficult economic environment

liquidity and capital resources automotive sector our strategy is to ensure we have sufficient funding available with a high degree of certainty throughout the business cycle 
the key elements of this strategy include maintaining large gross cash balances  generating cash from operating related activities  having a long dated debt maturity profile  maintaining committed credit facilities and funding long term liabilities over time 
gross cash 
automotive gross cash includes cash and cash equivalents  marketable and loaned securities and assets contained in a short term voluntary employee beneficiary association trust veba see below 
gross cash as of december   and is detailed below in billions december  cash and cash equivalents marketable securities loaned securities total cash  marketable securities and loaned securities short term veba assets gross cash as part of our investment strategy  we engage in securities lending to improve the returns on our cash portfolios 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for additional discussion on securities lending 
in managing our business  we classify changes in gross cash into four categories operating related both including and excluding pension long term veba contributions and tax refunds  capital transactions with the financial services sector  acquisitions and divestitures and other primarily financing related 
our key metric for operating related cash flow is cash flow before funded pension item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and long term veba contributions and tax refunds 
this metric best represents the ability of our automotive operations to generate cash 
we believe the cash flow analysis reflected in the table below  which differs from a cash flow statement presented in accordance with gaap  is useful to investors because it includes cash flow elements that we consider to be related to our operating activities eg  capital spending that are not included in cash flows from operating activities before securities trading  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure

debt and net cash 
at december   our automotive sector had total senior debt of billion compared with billion a year ago 
the decrease in debt primarily reflected the retirement of about billion of relatively high cost debt through open market repurchases 
most of the retired debt had maturity dates between and during  we intend  depending on market conditions  to continue repurchasing our outstanding debt securities from time to time and to continue making contributions to our funded pension plans and veba 
such debt repurchases likely would be concentrated in  but not limited to  the following four debt issues  of which up to of any one issue potentially may be purchased debentures due october  with an original aggregate principal amount of billion  debentures due february  with an original aggregate principal amount of billion  global landmark securities due july  with an original aggregate principal amount of billion  and debentures due january  with an original aggregate principal amount of million 
ford motor company capital trust ii trust ii had outstanding billion of trust preferred securities at december  the dividend and liquidation preference on these securities are paid from interest and principal payments on our junior subordinated debentures held by trust ii in a principal amount of billion 
on january   we redeemed our outstanding junior subordinated debentures held by ford motor company capital trust i 
this had the effect of reducing total automotive subordinated debt by about million 
at december   our automotive sector had net cash defined as gross cash less total senior and subordinated debt of billion  compared with billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
the weighted average maturity of our total long term debt including subordinated debt  substantially all of which is fixed rate debt  is approximately years with about billion maturing by december  the weighted average maturity of total debt long term and short term item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued including subordinated debt is approximately years 
for additional information on debt  see note of the notes to the financial statements 
seasonal working capital funding 
in july  we raised billion of short term ie  less than days bank loans to finance our annual summer vacation plant shutdown 
the shutdown period normally results in temporary cash outflow as cash payments to suppliers and dealers continue  but vehicles are not produced 
the short term seasonal working capital funding reduced the annual cash volatility that results from our shutdown period 
similarly  we raised billion in january to finance our annual holiday shutdown at the end of credit facilities 
at december   the automotive sector had billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks  of which billion were available for use 
for further discussion of our committed credit facilities  see note of the notes to the financial statements 
financial services sector ford credit debt and cash 
ford credit s total debt was billion at december   down billion compared with a year ago  primarily reflecting lower funding requirements due to lower asset levels 
ford credit s outstanding unsecured commercial paper at december  totaled billion  up billion compared with a year ago and up approximately million compared with year end  primarily reflecting increased investor demand 
at december   ford credit had cash and cash equivalents of billion 
in the normal course of its funding activities  ford credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs 
these excess amounts are maintained primarily as highly liquid investments  which provide liquidity for ford credit s short term funding obligations and give ford credit flexibility in the use of its other funding programs 
funding 
ford credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business 
ford credit s funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to i purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of ford products  which are influenced by ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through ford credit  ii provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for ford dealers  and iii repay its debt obligations 
ford credit s funding sources include debt issuances  sales of receivables in securitizations and other structured financings  and bank borrowings 
debt issuance consists of short and long term unsecured debt  placed directly by ford credit or through securities dealers or underwriters in the united states and international capital markets  and reaches both retail and institutional investors 
ford credit issues commercial paper in the united states  europe  canada and other international markets 
in addition to its commercial paper programs  ford credit also obtains short term funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes  which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holder thereof without restriction 
at december   the principal amount outstanding of such notes was billion 
ford credit does not hold reserves to fund the payment of the demand notes or any other short term funding obligation 
ford credit s policy is to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents  unused committed bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuer capacity  securitizable assets  and back up credit facilities to provide liquidity for all of its short term funding obligations 
during  ford credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements through securitizations because of the stability of the market for asset backed securities  their lower relative costs given our credit ratings as described below  and the diversity of funding sources that they provide 
securitized funding both on and off balance sheet  net of retained interests as a item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued percent of total managed receivables was as follows as of the end of each of the last three years   
the following table illustrates ford credit s term public funding issuances for and and its planned issuances for in billions forecast unsecured term debt institutional retail total unsecured term debt term public securitization total term public funding reflects new issuance and includes funding from discontinued operations in and  excludes whole loan sales  and other structured financings 
the cost of both debt and funding in securitizations is based on a margin or spread over a benchmark interest rate  such as interest rates paid on us treasury securities of similar maturities 
over the last two years  on an indicative basis  spreads on ford credit s securitized funding have fluctuated between and basis points above year us treasury securities  while ford credit s unsecured long term debt funding spreads have fluctuated between and basis points above comparable us treasury securities 
in  on an indicative basis  ford credit s unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between and basis points above year us treasury securities  with an average spread of basis points and a year end spread of basis points above comparable us treasury securities 
during  ford credit began a program to sell retail installment sale contracts in transactions where it retains no interest and thus no exposure to the sold assets 
these transactions  referred to as whole loan sale transactions  provide liquidity by enabling ford credit to reduce its managed receivables and its need for funding to support those receivables 
total outstanding receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions at december  were billion 
as a result of lower credit ratings over the last three years  ford credit focused its efforts on further diversification of funding sources and reduced its reliance on short term funding  especially unsecured commercial paper 
ford credit launched new asset backed commercial paper and retail unsecured bond programs  and it expanded its securitization and other structured financing channels  including transactions by foreign affiliates and expansion of its bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers program 
as ford credit s short term credit ratings have declined  asset backed commercial paper programs have become more cost effective compared with unsecured commercial paper  and allow ford credit access to a larger investor base 
as a result of ford credit s funding strategy and the reduction in its managed receivables  lower credit ratings during the past three years have not had a material impact on ford credit s ability to fund its operations 
any further lowering of its credit ratings may increase ford credit s borrowing costs and potentially constrain its funding sources 
this could cause ford credit to increase its use of securitization or other sources of liquidity or to reduce the amount of receivables it could purchase  thereby potentially adversely affecting its ability to support the sale of ford vehicles 
for additional funding and to maintain liquidity  ford credit and its majority owned subsidiaries  including fce  have contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled approximately billion at december  this includes billion of ford credit facilities billion global and approximately million non global and billion of fce facilities billion global and approximately million non global 
approximately million of the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued total facilities were in use at december  additionally  at december   banks provided billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities supporting two asset backed commercial paper programs established by ford credit 
ford credit also has entered into agreements with a number of bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from ford credit  at ford credit s option  up to billion of receivables in the aggregate at december  for further discussion of these facilities and agreements  see note of the notes to the financial statements 
leverage 
ford credit uses leverage  or the debt to equity ratio  to make various business decisions  including establishing pricing for retail  wholesale and lease financing  and assessing its capital structure 
ford credit calculates leverage on a financial statement basis and on a managed basis using the following formulas total debt financial statement leverage equity retained interest in securitized securitized off balance off balance cash sfas no 
sheet sheet and cash adjustments total debt receivables receivables equivalents on total debt managed leverage equity minority sfas no 
interest adjustment on equity the following table illustrates the calculation of ford credit s financial statement leverage in billions  except for ratios december  total debt total stockholder s equity debt to equity ratio to the following table illustrates the calculation of ford credit s managed leverage in billions  except for ratios december  total debt securitized off balance sheet receivables outstanding a retained interest in securitized off balance sheet receivables b adjustments for cash and cash equivalents adjustments for sfas no 
total adjusted debt total stockholder s equity including minority interest adjustments for sfas no 
total adjusted equity managed debt to equity ratio to a includes securitized funding from discontinued operations 
b includes retained interest in securitized receivables from discontinued operations 
ford credit believes that managed leverage  which is the result of adjustments to its financial statement leverage  is useful to its investors because it reflects the way ford credit manages its item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued business 
ford credit retains interests in receivables sold in off balance sheet securitization transactions  and with respect to subordinated retained interests  is exposed to credit risk 
accordingly  ford credit considers securitization as an alternative source of funding and evaluates credit losses  receivables and leverage on a managed as well as a financial statement basis 
ford credit also deducts cash and cash equivalents because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support its operations 
in addition  ford credit adds its minority interests to its financial statement equity  because all of the debt of such consolidated entities is included in its total debt 
sfas no 
requires ford credit to make fair value adjustments to its assets  debt and equity positions to reflect the impact of interest rate instruments ford credit uses in connection with its term debt issuances and securitizations 
sfas no 
adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market interest rates 
ford credit generally repays its debt funding obligations as they mature 
as a result  ford credit excludes the impact of sfas no 
on both the numerator and denominator in order to exclude the interim effects of changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  the managed leverage measure provides ford credit s investors with meaningful information regarding management s decision making processes 
ford credit s managed leverage strategy involves establishing a leverage level that it believes reflects the risk characteristics of its underlying assets 
in establishing a target leverage level  ford credit considers the characteristics of the receivables in its managed portfolio and the prevailing market conditions 
at december   ford credit s managed leverage was to  compared with to a year ago 
ford credit s dividend policy is based in part on its strategy to maintain managed leverage at the lower end of the to range 
based on profitability and managed receivable levels  ford credit paid dividends of billion in in the first quarter of  ford credit expects to decrease its managed leverage to the lower end of its target range  and remain at the low end of the range throughout the year 
hertz hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment  which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment 
hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers 
the financing requirements of hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry 
hertz fleet size  and its related financing requirements  generally peak in the summer months  and decline during the winter months 
hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs  and also draws from bank lines  as a normal business practice  to fund international needs 
hertz also is active in the domestic secured and unsecured medium term and long term debt markets and in the unsecured international medium term debt market 
hertz has an asset backed securitization abs program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing flexibility 
as of december   million was outstanding under the abs program consisting of million of commercial paper and million of medium term notes 
at december   hertz had committed credit facilities totaling billion 
of this amount  billion represented global and other committed credit facilities million of which are available through june  and million of which have various maturities of up to four years  million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by ford  which currently expires in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued june  million consisted of asset backed letters of credit  and million consisted of day asset backed commercial paper facilities 
total company stockholders equity 
our stockholders equity was billion at december   up billion compared with december  the increase primarily reflected net income and foreign currency translation adjustments  offset partially by dividends and the change in our minimum pension liability 
for additional discussion of foreign currency translation adjustments  see note of the notes to the financial statements 
pension 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for our employees in many countries 
pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the uaw  under which most of our us hourly employees are covered  we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension benefits to retirees covered by the contract 
these obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in note of the notes to our financial statements and under critical accounting estimates below 
included in our stockholders equity was a billion adjustment for our worldwide minimum pension liability as of december  this was about million greater than the adjustment  due to the decline in the funded status of our worldwide pension plans ie  the amount by which the present value of projected benefit obligations exceeded the market value of pension plan assets as of december   compared with december  the primary factor that contributed to the decline in the funded status was the decrease in discount rates at december  used to calculate the present value of benefit obligations compared with the prior year  partially offset by the actual return on plan assets for in excess of the expected asset return 
credit ratings 
our short and long term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros by the securities and exchange commission dominion bond rating service limited dbrs  fitch  inc fitch  moody s investors service  inc moody s  and standard poor s rating services  a division of mcgraw hill companies  inc s p 
in several markets  locally recognized rating agencies also rate us 
a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue  based on information provided by us and other sources 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk  and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency 
lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets 
the nrsros have indicated that our lower ratings are primarily a reflection of the rating agencies concerns regarding our automotive cash flow and profitability  declining market share  excess industry capacity  industry pricing pressure and rising healthcare costs

on october   president bush signed into law the american jobs creation act of the act 
the most significant component of the act was the repeal of the extraterritorial income eti exclusion and the replacement of eti with a domestic deduction for a range of broadly item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued defined domestic production activities 
the act also provides for a one year period to repatriate certain foreign earnings at a special tax rate 
we continue to evaluate the application of the repatriation provisions 
if we determine that we will repatriate earnings pursuant to these provisions  a favorable earnings impact would result 
we expect to make a determination about the applicability of the repatriation provisions in the last quarter of the other provisions of the act are not expected to have a material impact on future earnings 
we expect our full year effective tax rate to be between and  excluding any potential effect of the repatriation of foreign earnings provisions of the act 
as disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   we have been in discussions with visteon regarding changes to improve the efficiency and operating results of both companies  and these discussions are ongoing 
actions that may result from these discussions could include modifications to our existing commercial arrangements with visteon  including modifications with respect to visteon s present obligation to reimburse us for the costs of the approximately  ford employees assigned to visteon 
these modifications likely would result in a significant charge to earnings in the period in which they occur  but would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on future ongoing results of operations 
in order that visteon continues to supply certain components without cost surcharges to us  on march   we agreed to provide visteon with the following financial assistance at least through the end of relieving visteon of a portion about million per month of its obligation to reimburse us for the costs of our employees assigned to visteon eg  wage costs  reducing by about one fourth the number of days within which we are required to make payment to visteon for materials and components that we purchase from visteon  and acquiring up to about million of new machinery and equipment for use by visteon necessary for its production of components for us 
any broader agreement that might result from our ongoing discussions with visteon could substantially modify this and any other existing visteon agreements

critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
warranty and additional service actions nature of estimates required 
the estimated warranty and additional service action costs are accrued for each vehicle at the time of sale 
estimates are principally based on assumptions item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line  where little or no claims experience may exist 
in addition  the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved  and policies related to additional service actions  are taken into consideration 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors  changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income 
assumptions and approach used 
our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile  therefore  our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions 
pensions nature of estimates required 
the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
assumptions and approach used 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates expected contributions we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on long term bonds rated aa or better 
in the united states we use the moody s aa long term bond yield as the initial indicator of these yields 
we also consider the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available bonds rated aa or better 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets assumption reflects various long run inputs  including historical plan returns and peer data  as well as inputs from a range of internal and external advisors for capital market returns  inflation and other variables  adjusted for specific aspects of our strategy 
the expected amount and timing of contributions is based on an assessment of minimum requirements  and additional amounts based on cash availability and other considerations eg  funded status  avoidance of pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc penalty premiums and tax efficiency 
retirement and mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience 
plan obligations and costs are based on existing retirement plan provisions 
no assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed eg  in labor contracts 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are included in unamortized net gains and losses 
unamortized gains and losses are amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in future periods

sensitivity analysis 
the december  funded status of our pension plans is affected by december  assumptions 
pension expense for is based on the plan design and assumptions as of december  note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric  and are specific to they also may not be additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown

  actual return on assets expected return on assets the foregoing indicates that changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans  stockholders equity and expense 
as stated above  we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on long term bonds rated aa or better 
we cannot predict these bond yields or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether adjustments to our stockholders equity for minimum pension liability in subsequent years will be significant 
other postretirement benefits retiree health care and life insurance nature of estimates required 
the measurement of our obligations  costs and liabilities associated with other postretirement benefits ie  retiree health care and life insurance requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases  salary increases and demographic experience  which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments 
assumptions and approach used 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates health care cost trends salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates expected contributions our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  efficiencies and other cost mitigation actions including eligibility management  employee education and wellness  competitive sourcing and appropriate employee cost sharing and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated aa or better 
we use the moody s aa long term bond yield as the initial indicator of these yields 
we also consider the yield derived from matching projected other postretirement benefit payments with maturities of a portfolio of available bonds rated aa or better 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets assumption reflects various long run inputs  including historical plan returns and peer data  as well as inputs from a range of internal and external advisors for capital market returns  inflation and other variables  adjusted for specific aspects of our strategy 
the expected amount and timing of contributions is based on an assessment of cash availability and other considerations eg  funded item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued status and tax efficiency 
retirement and mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience 
plan obligations and costs are based on existing retirement plan provisions 
no assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed eg  in labor contracts 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are included in unamortized net gains and losses 
unamortized gains and losses are amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in future periods

the december  postretirement benefits obligation is affected by december  assumptions 
postretirement benefit expense for is based on the plan design and assumptions as of december  note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric  and are specific to they are not additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown

 health care cost trends total expense health care cost trends service and interest expense allowance for credit losses financial services sector the allowance for credit losses is our estimate of credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements 
we monitor credit loss performance monthly and we assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly 
because credit losses can vary substantially over time  estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain 
nature of estimates required 
we estimate the credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several factors including historical credit loss trends  the credit quality of our present portfolio  trends in historical and projected used vehicle values and general economic measures 
assumptions and approach used 
we make projections of two key assumptions frequency the number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that we expect to default over a period of time  measured as repossessions  and loss severity the expected difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive  net of expenses  from selling the repossessed vehicle  including any recoveries from the customer 
we use these assumptions to assist us in setting our allowance for credit losses 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses 
sensitivity analysis 
we believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses adequately reflects credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases 
however  changes in the assumptions used to derive frequency and severity would affect the allowance for credit losses 
over the past twenty years  repossession rates for our ford  lincoln and mercury brand us retail and lease portfolio have varied between and

loss severity changes in our assumptions affect provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet 
accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases financial services sector accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term 
we monitor residual values each month  and we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis 
if we believe that the expected residual values for our vehicles have changed  we revise depreciation to ensure that our net investment in the operating leases equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles minus accumulated depreciation will be adjusted to reflect our revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term 
such adjustments to depreciation expense would result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded on a straight line basis 
each lease customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer 
if the customer returns the vehicle to the dealer  the dealer may buy the vehicle from us or return it to us 
over the last three years  about to of ford credit s north america operating lease vehicles have been returned to us 
nature of estimates required 
each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer 
at the time we purchase a lease  we establish an expected residual value for the vehicle 
we estimate the expected residual value by evaluating historical auction values  historical return rates for our leased vehicles  industry wide used vehicle prices  our marketing plans and vehicle quality data 
assumptions and approach used 
our accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on our assumptions of auction value the market value of the vehicles when we sell them at the end of the lease  and return rates the percentage of vehicles that will be returned to us at lease end 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases 
sensitivity analysis 
for returned vehicles  we face a risk that the amount we obtain from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than our estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle 
at year end  if future auction values for ford  lincoln and mercury brand vehicles in the us with to month operating lease terms were to decrease by one percent from our present estimates  the impact would be to increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about million 
similarly  if return rates for our existing portfolio of to month term ford  lincoln and mercury brand vehicles in the us were to increase by one percentage point from our present estimates  the impact would be to increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about million 
these increases item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in depreciation would be charged to depreciation expense during the through period so that the net investment in operating leases at the end of the lease term for these vehicles is equal to the revised expected residual value 
adjustments to the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet as net investment in operating leases and on the income statement in depreciation  in each case under the financial services sector 
accounting standards issued but not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
in addition  this statement amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
under a modified prospective method to all unvested employee awards as of january  and all new awards granted to employees after january  and forward 
although we are assessing its impact  we do not expect adoption of this revision to the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
arb no 
stated that the above mentioned items under some circumstances are so abnormal that they require treatment as current period charges 
sfas no 
requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and handling costs  be treated as current period charges  regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
we have applied arb no 
consistent with sfas no 
and we do not expect any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
apb no 
required that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged  with the exception for exchange of similar productive assets which should be measured based on the recorded amount 
the sfas no 
requires the exchange of nonmonetary assets to be measured on fair value with the exception of exchanges for such assets which lack commercial substance  the fair value is not determinable or an exchange transaction that facilitates sales to customers 
we have adopted sfas no 
and will apply on a prospective basis 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
these include guarantees  sales of receivables by ford credit  and variable interest entities  each of which is discussed below 
guarantees see note of the notes to the financial statements for a discussion of our guarantees 
sales of receivables by ford credit securitization 
ford credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations 
ford credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market for securitization of financial item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued assets provides it with a lower cost source of funding  compared with unsecured debt given its present credit ratings  diversifies its funding among different markets and investors  and provides additional liquidity 
in a typical securitization transaction  ford credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary that establishes an spe  usually a trust  and transfers the receivables to the spe in exchange for proceeds from interest bearing securities  commonly called asset backed securities  that are issued by the spe and are secured by future collections on the sold receivables 
following the transfer of the sold receivables to the spe  and if in compliance with sfas no 
discussed below  the receivables are no longer assets of ford credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on its balance sheet 
the securities issued by the spe are structured into senior and subordinated classes 
the senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the sold receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization and cash reserve funds 
these securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions 
the following flow chart diagrams ford credit s typical us retail securitization transaction chart consistent with conventional practices in the securitization industry  ford credit uses spes in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors 
some of the spes used in ford credit s securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities 
when these accounting rules are met  the sold receivables are removed from its balance sheet 
the use of spes in the typical securitization structure  along with the use of various forms of credit and payment enhancements to reduce the risk of loss  allows the spe to issue senior asset backed securities that generally receive the highest short term credit ratings and among the highest long term credit ratings  thereby providing ford credit with a cost effective source of funding 
ford credit selects receivables at random for securitization transactions using selection criteria designed for the specific transaction 
the selection criteria are generally based on factors such as location of the obligor  contract term  payment schedule  interest rate  financing program  and the type of financed vehicle 
in general  the criteria also require receivables to be active and in good standing 
ford credit retains interests in the securitized receivables 
the retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities issued by the spe  undivided interests in wholesale receivables  restricted cash held for the benefit of the spes for example  a reserve fund and residual interests in securitization transactions 
income from residual interest in securitization transactions represents the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the spe to pay interest and principal to investors  servicing fees and other required payments 
ford credit retains credit risk in securitizations 
ford credit s retained interests include the most subordinated interests in the spe  which are the first to absorb credit losses on the sold receivables 
the impact of credit losses in the pool of sold receivables will likely be limited to ford credit s retained interests because securitizations are structured to protect the holders of the senior asset backed securities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at december  and  the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by ford credit in securitizations was billion and billion  respectively 
this decrease primarily reflected lower funding requirements 
at december  and  ford credit s retained interests in such sold receivables were billion and billion  respectively 
ford credit generally has no obligation to repurchase or replace any receivable sold to an spe that subsequently becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default 
investors holding securities issued by a spe have no recourse to ford credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no right to require it to repurchase the securities 
ford credit does not guarantee any asset backed securities and has no obligation to provide liquidity or make monetary contributions or contributions of additional receivables to its spes either due to the performance of the sold receivables or the credit rating of its short term or long term debt 
however  as the seller and servicer of the finance receivables to the spe  ford credit is obligated to provide certain kinds of support to its securitizations  which are customary in the securitization industry 
these obligations consist of indemnifications  receivable repurchase obligations on receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified  the mandatory sale of additional receivables in revolving transactions  and servicer advances 
risks to future sales of receivables 
some of ford credit s securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding from these sources if the credit losses or delinquencies in a pool of sold receivables exceed specified levels  the delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or our overall portfolio of receivables exceeds specified levels  the payment rates on wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels  or the amount of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels 
ford credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables 
in addition  ford credit s ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell  the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions  general demand for the type of receivables ford credit offers  market capacity for ford credit sponsored investments  accounting and regulatory changes  ford credit s credit ratings and ford credit s ability to maintain back up liquidity facilities for certain securitization programs 
if as a result of any of these or other factors  the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to ford credit  ford credit s operations  financial condition and liquidity would be adversely impacted 
variable interest entities see note of the notes to the financial statements for a discussion of our variable interest entities 
aggregate contractual obligations we are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties 
most of these are debt obligations incurred by our financial services sector 
in addition  as part of our normal business practices  we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials  components and services 
these arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements 
we enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services 
purchase obligations are defined as off balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the other liabilities category includes only liabilities on our balance sheet that have a definite pay out scheme or are not contingent on a subsequent event

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview we are exposed to a variety of market and other risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates  as well as risks to availability of funding sources  hazard events  and specific asset risks 
these risks affect our automotive and financial services sectors differently 
we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which includes regular reports to a central management committee  the global risk management committee grmc 
the grmc is chaired by our chief financial officer  and its members include our treasurer  our controller  and other members of senior management 
our automotive and financial services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk  or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable 
we  and particularly ford credit  which comprises substantially all of our financial services sector  maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles 
as discussed in greater detail in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our funding sources include commercial paper  term debt  sales of receivables through securitization transactions  committed lines of credit from major banks  and other sources 
we are exposed to a variety of insurable risks  such as loss or damage to property  liability claims  and employee injury 
we protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses 
direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our treasurer s office and is governed by written polices and procedures 
separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades  the transaction of derivatives  and the settlement of cash flows 
regular audits are conducted to ensure that item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective 
in addition  our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the grmc  and the audit and finance committees of our board of directors 
in accordance with corporate risk management policies  we use derivative instruments  such as forward contracts  swaps and options that economically hedge certain exposures foreign currency  commodity  and interest rates 
derivative positions are used to manage underlying exposures  we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
in certain instances  we forgo hedge accounting  which results in unrealized gains and losses that are recognized currently in net income  examples of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting include foreign currency hedges of inter company loans and dividends and certain transactions that use multiple hedge instruments 
for additional information on our derivatives  see note of the notes to the financial statements 
the market and counterparty risks of our automotive sector and ford credit are discussed and quantified below 
automotive market and counterparty risk our automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies  including the following purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts  debt and other payables  subsidiary dividends  and investments in foreign operations 
these expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates 
we also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our automotive sector and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying cash flow exposures being hedged 
our earnings at risk ear methodology is based on transaction exposure  which is the exposure that results from specific transactions and our related hedging activity 
the methodology does not attempt to assess the impact on financial statement earnings resulting from non cash flow risks eg  re measurement of foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities through income 
ear at a confidence level is the methodology used to calculate the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to cash flows in foreign currency and commodity price exposure 
the ear model is used as an estimation of risk and a management tool  but will not necessarily represent actual changes in earnings based on the combination of hedging and underlying exposures 
the calculation of ear combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies or commodity prices 
this creates hypothetical prices based on the calculation of historical volatilities  therefore  the ear model may not accurately predict future market risk 
the ear methodology includes our hedging actions as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period 
foreign currency risk 
foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
accordingly  we use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenues and costs  assets  liabilities  investments in foreign operations  and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in our hedging actions  we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk eg  forward contracts and options 
at december   the ear from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is projected at million  within a confidence level for the unhedged exposure 
when calculated at the end of each quarter throughout the year  the high was million  the low was million and the average was million  the risks impacting financial instruments are offset with underlying exposure being hedged 
the year end item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued projection is approximately million higher than the ear projection for calculated as of december  the increased exposure results primarily from changes in the unhedged portfolio 
the effect of currency movements on business units will vary based on the currency profile of the business unit including any hedging actions taken 
it can also be affected by competitive responses to currency changes 
commodity price risk 
commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities  such as non ferrous metals eg  aluminum and precious metals eg  palladium  ferrous metals eg  steel and iron castings  energy eg  natural gas and electricity  and plastics resins eg  polypropylene  which we use in the production of motor vehicles 
we use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge primarily non ferrous metals  precious metals and energies 
in our hedging actions  we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk eg  financially settled forward contracts  swaps  and options 
based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying commodities exposures at december   the ear from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is projected at million  within a confidence level when calculated at the end of each quarter throughout the year  the high was million  the low was million and the average was million  the risks impacting financial instruments are offset with underlying exposure being hedged 
the year end level is approximately million higher than the ear projection for calculated as of december  the increased exposure results primarily from higher commodity prices and hedging levels consistent with our overall hedging strategy 
in addition  our purchasing organization with the oversight of the grmc negotiates contracts to ensure continuous supply of raw materials 
in some cases  these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific prices and as such  play a role in managing price risk 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur in our automotive investment portfolio due to a change in interest rates 
our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolio includes cash and cash equivalents  marketable and loaned securities and short term veba assets 
at december   we had billion in our automotive investment portfolio  compared to billion at december  we invest the portfolio in securities of various types and maturities  the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
these securities are generally classified as either trading or available for sale 
the trading portfolio gains and losses unrealized and realized are reported in the income statement 
the available for sale portfolio realized gains or losses are reported in the income statement  and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity in other comprehensive income 
the investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity  minimize risk  and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our trading and available for sale portfolios 
as of december   the value of our trading portfolio was billion  which is billion lower than december  the value of our available for sale portfolio was billion  which is billion higher than december  assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the value of our trading and available for sale portfolios would be reduced by million and million  respectively 
this compares to million and million  respectively  as calculated as of december  the decrease in reported exposure is the result of using actual portfolio durations instead of long term targets 
portfolio durations have been reduced below long term targets to help shield the portfolios from the possible adverse impact of an increase in interest rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued using the actual duration of our trading and available for sale portfolios as of december   the value of these portfolios would have been reduced by million and million  respectively  by a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point 
while these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario  actual results could differ from those projected 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
counterparty risk 
counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract 
we enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk 
exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risk 
we  together with ford credit  establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification 
our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the treasurer 
our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive  allowing us to take risk mitigation actions 
we establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure  based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities 
the exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures 
we use a monte carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor  defined at a confidence level 
substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single a or better 
ford credit market risks overview 
ford credit is exposed to a variety of risks in the normal course of its business activities 
in addition to counterparty risk discussed above  ford credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures market risk the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results  credit risk the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payments according to contract terms  residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds ford credit receives at lease termination will be lower than its projections or return rates will be higher than its projections  and  liquidity risk the possibility that ford credit may be unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner 
each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to ford credit s overall global risk 
business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks 
credit and residual risks are discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption critical accounting estimates and liquidity risk is discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption liquidity and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued capital resources financial services sector ford credit 
a discussion of ford credit s market risks is included below 
foreign currency risk 
to meet funding objectives  ford credit issues debt or  for its international affiliates  draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies 
ford credit faces exposure to currency exchange rate changes if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables 
when possible  receivables are funded with debt in the same currency  minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements 
when a different currency is used  ford credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives 
these derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables 
as a result  ford credit s market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which ford credit is exposed and consists principally of re pricing risk or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an instrument s re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates 
it refers to the time it takes an instrument s interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates 
for fixed rate instruments  the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instrument s principal because  with a fixed interest rate  the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument 
for a floating rate instrument  the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate 
for instance  a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on december st would have a re pricing period of one year on january st  regardless of the instrument s maturity 
ford credit s receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables 
fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract 
ford credit s funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations 
in the case of unsecured term debt  and in an effort to have funds available throughout the business cycle  ford credit may issue debt with five to ten year maturities  which is generally longer than the terms of its assets 
these debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity 
ford credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt 
specifically  without derivatives  ford credit s assets would re price more quickly than its debt 
ford credit s interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates 
ford credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps 
on a monthly basis  ford credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities its economic value to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows  discounted by market interest rates  and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
ford credit then enters into interest rate swaps  effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt to fixed or its fixed rate debt to floating  to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range 
ford credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using pre tax net item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued interest income simulation techniques 
these simulations calculate the projected pre tax net interest income of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios  including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve 
these quantifications of interest rate risk are reported to the treasurer each month 
the process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of ford credit s operations in the united states  canada and the united kingdom  which together represented approximately of its total on balance sheet finance receivables at december  for its other international affiliates  ford credit uses a technique commonly referred to as gap analysis  to measure re pricing mismatch 
this process uses re pricing schedules  which group assets  debt  and swaps into discrete time bands based on their re pricing characteristics 
under this process  ford credit enters into interest rate swaps  which effectively change the re pricing profile of its debt  to ensure that any re pricing mismatch between assets and liabilities existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance 
as a result of its interest rate risk management process  including derivatives  ford credit s debt re prices faster than its assets 
other things being equal  this means that during a period of rising interest rates  the interest rates paid on ford credit s debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on its assets  thereby initially reducing ford credit s pre tax net interest income 
correspondingly  during a period of falling interest rates  ford credit s pre tax net interest income would be expected to initially increase 
to provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre tax net interest income to changes in interest rates  ford credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical  instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities a parallel shift  as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels 
the differences between these scenarios and the base case over a twelve month period represent an estimate of the sensitivity of ford credit s pre tax net interest income 
the sensitivity as of year end and was as follows pre tax net interest pre tax net interest income impact given a income impact given a one percentage point one percentage point instantaneous increase instantaneous decrease in interest rates in interest rates in millions in millions december  december  based on assumptions included in the analysis  sensitivity to a one percentage point instantaneous change in interest rates was lower at year end than at year end this change primarily reflects the results of normal fluctuations within the approved tolerances of risk management strategy 
while the sensitivity analysis presented is ford credit s best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios  the model ford credit uses for this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions  so that actual results could differ from those projected 
embedded in the model ford credit uses are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal  refinancing of maturing debt  and predicted repayment of retail installment sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity 
ford credit s repayment projections of retail installment sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience 
if interest rates or other factors were to change  the actual prepayment experience could be different than projected 
additionally  interest rate changes of one percentage point or more are rarely instantaneous or parallel  and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in ford credit s analysis 
as a result  the actual impact to pre tax net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed above 
the model used to conduct this analysis also relies heavily on item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal  refinancing of maturing debt  and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity 
the fair value of ford credit s net derivative financial instruments derivative assets less derivative liabilities as reported in note of the notes to the financial statements as of december  was billion 
this was approximately billion lower than a year ago 
this decrease primarily reflects the maturity of swaps that were significantly in the money and lower mark to market adjustments resulting from interest rate changes 
increases related to the continued strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar were a partial offset
