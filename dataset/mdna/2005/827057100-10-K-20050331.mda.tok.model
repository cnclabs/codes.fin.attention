overview we are a leading supplier of flash memory semiconductor devices for the digital consumer  networking  wireless communication and internet computing markets 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by periodic changes in business conditions caused by product supply and demand imbalance 
when the industry experiences downturns  they often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns are characterized by weak product demand  excessive inventory and accelerated declines of selling prices 
in some cases  downturns  such as the one we experienced from late through  have lasted for more than a year 
we began to experience a slow recovery during through the first half of during the second half of and the first half of  demand for our products increased sharply and we began to see improvements in the average selling prices of our products 
however  we experienced a decrease in the average selling prices of our products as a result of the slow down in the demand for some of our products in the second half of and our business could be further harmed again by prolonged industry wide downturns in the future 
our product sales are made primarily using short term cancelable purchase orders 
the quantities actually purchased by the customer  as well as shipment schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customer s needs and in our supply of products 
accordingly  our backlog of open purchase orders at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future sales 
changes in the amount of our backlog do not necessarily reflect a corresponding change in the level of actual or potential sales 
we derived  and of our net product revenues during  and  respectively  from product shipments to asia 
additionally  substantially all of our wafer suppliers and packaging and testing subcontractors are located in asia 
shipments to our top ten end customers  which excludes transactions through stocking representatives and distributors  accounted for  and of our net product revenues in  and  respectively 
no single end customer  which we define as original equipment manufacturers  or oems  original design manufacturers  or odms  contract electronic manufacturers  or cems  or end users  represented or more of our net product revenues during  and since  we have been increasing our out sourcing activities for our customer service logistics to support our customers 
silicon professional technology ltd  or spt  supports our customers in taiwan  china and other southeast asia countries 
spt provides planning  warehousing  delivery  billing  collection and other logistic functions for us in these regions 
spt is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of our stocking representatives in taiwan  professional computer technology limited  or pct 
please see a description of our relationship with pct under related party transactions 
products shipped to spt are accounted for as our inventory held at our logistics center  and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
for the years ended december   and  spt serviced end customer sales accounting for  and of our net product revenues recognized 
as of december   and  spt represented  and of our net accounts receivable  respectively 
we ship products to  and have accounts receivable from  oems  odms  cems  stocking representatives  distributors  and our logistics center 
our stocking representatives  distributors and logistics center reship our products to our end customers  including oems  odms  cems and end users 
shipments  by us or our logistic center  to our top three stocking representatives for reshipment accounted for  and of our product shipments in  and  respectively 
in addition  the same three stocking representatives solicited sales  for which they received a commission  for  and of our product shipments to end users in  and  respectively 
results of operations years ended december   and net revenues net revenues were million in  million in and million in net revenues for increased compared to due to increased unit shipments and average selling prices  increased license and royalty revenues and sales from companies acquired during net revenues for increased compared to due to increased unit shipments and increased license and royalty revenues  offset by decreased average selling prices 
average selling prices fluctuate due to a number of factors including the overall supply and demand for our products in the marketplace  maturing product cycles and changes in general economic conditions 
product revenues 
product revenues were million in  million in and million in product revenues for increased compared to primarily due to increased unit shipments by  and increased average selling prices by 
product revenues for increased compared to primarily due to increased unit shipments by  partially offset by decreased average selling prices by 
the decrease from to was primarily due to decreased average selling prices by  partially offset by increased unit shipments of our products by 
shipping volumes fluctuate due to overall industry supply and demand 
license revenues 
revenues from license fees and royalties were million in  million in and million in the increase from to is due to increased license fees of million from our new licensees 
the increase from to related primarily to increased royalty payments from our existing licensees and up front license fees from our new licensees 
we anticipate that license revenues may fluctuate significantly in the future 
gross profit gross profit was million  or of net revenues  in  million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the increase in gross profit in when compared to is primarily due to improved manufacturing costs achieved by transitioning manufacturing technology to smaller geometries  the sale of previously reserved inventory  increases in average selling prices and unit shipments by and  respectively  as well as increased revenues from technology licensing by million  offset by a net increase of million in our provision for inventory and adverse purchase commitments over the provision 
the increase in gross profit in when compared to is primarily due to increased unit shipments of  increased technology licensing revenues of million and improved manufacturing costs as a result of transitions to more advanced process technologies  offset by decreased average selling prices by 
product gross margin was in  compared to in and in the increase in product gross margin in when compared to is primarily due to improved manufacturing costs  increases in average selling prices and unit shipments by and  respectively  offset by an increase in our provision for inventory and adverse purchase commitments of million over the provision 
the decrease in product gross margin in when compared to was primarily due to decreased average selling prices of  offset by improved manufacturing costs as a result of transitions to more advanced process technologies 
for other factors affecting our gross profit  please also see business risks we incurred significant inventory valuation adjustments in  and and we may incur additional significant inventory valuation adjustments in the future 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative and other expenses 
operating expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  million or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in from was primarily due to the atmel judgement of million in and million decrease in depreciation expense  offset by the million write off of in process research and development related to our newly acquired businesses  increases of million in headcount related expenses  million in mask  wafer and evaluation parts  million in general and administrative related to outside services and million in commission expense and million in operating lease impairment 
the increase in from was primarily due to the atmel judgement of million  offset by decreases of million in bad debt expense  million in mask  wafer and evaluation part expenses  million in legal fees  million in commission expense and million in depreciation expense 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  sales and marketing and to general and administrative activities  and that these expenses will increase in absolute dollars 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  quality assurance activities and occupancy costs 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits and the cost of materials such as wafers and masks 
research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in research and development expenses increased by from primarily due to increases in wafer  mask and evaluation part expenses of million due to the completion of certain technology projects during  headcount related expenses of million due to profit sharing payments and increased headcount  offset by reduced depreciation expense of thousand 
research and development expenses decreased by from primarily due to decreases in wafer  mask and evaluation part expenses of million due to cost reduction measures and the completion of certain technology projects during  headcount related expenses of million due to a reduction in headcount and depreciation expense of thousand

we expect sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  fluctuations in revenues will cause fluctuations in sales and marketing expenses as it impacts our commission expense 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for administrative  executive and finance personnel  recruiting costs  professional services and legal fees and allowances for doubtful accounts

we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we scale our facilities  infrastructure  and headcount to support our overall expected growth 
we may also incur additional expenses in connection with the atmel  shareholder class action and shareholder derivative litigation 
for further information on this litigation see legal proceedings 
other operating expenses 
in  other operating expenses of million  or of net revenues  were comprised of million related to the write off of in process research and development relating to the acquisition of emosyn and g plus and a million period charge related to an operating lease for an abandoned building

during  insyde  a company in which we have an investment  completed an initial public offering on the taiwan stock exchange 
since the initial public offering there had been a significant decline in the market value of the investment 
during  we recognized a thousand loss from the impairment of our equity investment because insyde s stock price had declined below the acquisition cost for more than six months 
the impairment was considered to be other than temporary in nature  thus the investment value was permanently written down to reflect the fair value 
as of december  the recorded value of our investment in insyde was thousand 
in  we acquired a interest in apacer  a privately held company located in taiwan that designs  manufactures and markets memory modules  for million in cash

provision for benefit from income taxes in  our income tax expense was million on a net income before tax of million 
during the year of  we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in the us in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
our income tax benefit of million in consisted of a tax rate on our loss before income taxes 
in  we implemented an international tax structure  which in conjunction with the full valuation allowance  will mean that going forward we will record a tax expense as a result of foreign tax withholding and alternative minimum tax until such time that the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is no longer required

critical accounting estimates our critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market  warranty accrual  litigation costs  valuation of equity investments  provision for adverse purchase commitments  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
sales to direct customers and foreign stocking representatives are recognized net of an allowance for estimated returns 
when product is shipped to direct customers or stocking representatives  or by our distributors or spt to end users  prior to recognizing revenue  we also require that evidence of the arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our shipping terms are generally freight on board  or fob  shipping point and payment terms typically range from to days 
sales to distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and future returns  we defer recognition of such revenues  related costs of revenues and related gross profit until the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
products shipped to spt are accounted for as our inventory held at our logistics center  and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
most of our technology licenses provide for the payment of up front license fees and continuing royalties based on product sales 
for license and other arrangements for technology that we are continuing to enhance and refine  and under which we are obligated to provide unspecified enhancements  revenue is recognized over the lesser of the estimated period that we have historically enhanced and developed refinements to the technology  approximately two to three years the upgrade period  or the remaining portion of the upgrade period from the date of delivery  provided all specified technology and documentation has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
from time to time  we reexamine the estimated upgrade period relating to licensed technology to determine if a change in the estimated upgrade period is needed 
revenue from license or other technology arrangements where we are not continuing to enhance and refine technology or are not obligated to provide unspecified enhancements is recognized upon delivery  if the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
royalties received under these arrangements during the upgrade period are recognized as revenue based on the ratio of the elapsed portion of the upgrade period to the estimated upgrade period 
the remaining portions of the royalties are recognized ratably over the remaining portion of the upgrade period 
royalties received after the upgrade period has elapsed are recognized when reported to us 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates in relation to the estimated period of technology enhancement and development  the amount and timing of our license and royalty revenues could be materially different 
allowance for sales returns 
we maintain allowances for sales returns for estimated product returns by our customers 
we estimate our allowance for sales returns based on our historical return experience  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  known returns we have not received and other assumptions 
the allowance for sales returns was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue could be materially different 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other assumptions 
if we were to make different judgments of the financial condition of our customers or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
the value of our inventory is dependent on our estimate of future average selling prices  and  if our projected average selling prices are over estimated  we may be required to adjust our inventory value to reflect the lower of cost or market 
our inventories include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we maintain allowance for inventory for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and those inventories carried at costs that are higher than their market values 
we review on hand inventory including inventory held at the logistic center for potential excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market exposure and adjust the level of inventory reserve accordingly 
some of our customers have requested that we ship them product that has a finished goods date of manufacture that is less than one year old 
in the event that this becomes a common requirement  it may be necessary for us to provide for an additional allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old  which could result in additional inventory write downs 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories includes an allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than two years old and for certain products with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old 
for the obsolete inventory analysis  we review inventory items in detail and consider date code  customer base requirements  known product defects  planned or recent product revisions  end of life plans and diminished market demand 
if we determine that market conditions are less favorable than those currently projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in average selling prices or demand not meeting our expectations  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories and lower of cost or market was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
warranty accrual 
our products are generally subject to warranty and we provide for the estimated future costs of repair  replacement or customer accommodation upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we have to replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the recorded value of our warranty accrual was thousand  thousand and million as of december   and  respectively 
litigation costs 
from time to time  we are also involved in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have incurred certain costs associated with defending these matters 
there can be no assurance the atmel complaint  shareholder class action complaints  shareholder derivative complaints or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future which may adversely impact gross margins 
as of december   no estimate can be made of the possible loss or possible range of loss associated with the resolution of these contingencies 
if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations in the semiconductor industry 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the recorded value of our equity investments was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
provision for adverse purchase commitments 
we maintain a provision for adverse purchase commitments for in process orders at our vendors when there is a lower of cost or market valuation against our on hand inventory 
once production has begun against our purchase orders  we are committed to purchasing the inventory or  if we cancel the order  we are liable for all costs incurred up to the time of cancellation 
if we have written down our on hand inventory of the ordered product for lower of cost or market valuations  we must consider the impact to in process inventory at our vendor 
we evaluate our in process orders to determine the impact of canceling the order and the impact of purchasing the inventory at a cost higher than the estimated current market value 
if we determine that market conditions become less favorable than those currently projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in average selling prices or demand not meeting our expectations  additional inventory write downs may be required when the inventory is purchased into inventory 
the recorded provision for adverse purchase commitments was million  thousand and million as of december   and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
during the third quarter of we recorded a charge to establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets offset by a reduction in income tax payable as a result of a reassessment of expected liabilities for and certain exposures 
accordingly  for we recorded an income tax expense of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in the us in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
during  we maintained a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
at december  and the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset was million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
our operating activities used cash of million in and million in for  our primary use of cash was for inventory purchases 
cash used in operating activities included an increase in inventory of million to support increased sales activities and forecast customer demands  a million increase in trade receivables from unrelated parties due to increased revenues and increases in other assets and deferred revenues of million 
cash generated from operating activities included a net income of million  a decrease in trade receivables from related parties of million due mainly to decreased payment terms with our logistic center  spt  an increase in related and unrelated trade accounts payable of million due to increased purchases of products and business activities  and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
non cash adjustments related to a provision for excess and obsolete inventories  write down of inventory to market and adverse purchase commitments of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million  in process research and development of million  a provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts of million and a million operating lease impairment charge 
for  our primary source of operating cash flow was the timing of inventory purchases and payments to our vendors and service providers  offset by the payment of million to atmel 
cash generated from operating activities included decreases in inventories of million due to increased sales  which reduced the amount of inventory held  and other current and non current assets of million  increases in trade accounts payable from related and unrelated parties of million due to increased strategic purchasing of certain products  increases in deferred revenue of million and non cash related adjustments of million 
non cash adjustments related to million of depreciation and amortization  million of inventory valuation adjustments  million decrease in net deferred tax assets and million of tax benefit from employee stock plans  offset by a thousand charge to expense for provision for doubtful accounts 
working capital uses of cash included a net loss of million  increases in trade accounts receivable from related and non related parties of million due to increased revenue at the end of compared to and increased activity through our logistic center which has extended payment terms and decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
investing activities 
our investing activities used cash of million during primarily due to investments in equity securities of gsmc  acet  nanotech  pct  pti and insyde of million  million  million  million  thousand and thousand  respectively  and the acquisitions of emosyn and g plus which used cash of million and million  respectively 
investing activities also used cash for purchases of available for sale investments and restricted cash of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
sales and maturities of available for sale investments provided cash from investing activities of million 
our investing activities provided cash of million during  primarily due to a total of million cash from the excess sales and maturities of available for sale investments and restricted cash over the purchases of such investments  offset by million invested in capital expenditures 
financing activities 
our financing activities used cash of million in and provided cash of million in during  the repurchase of our common stock used cash of million and the issuance of shares of common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee stock options provided cash of million 
repayment of loans used cash of thousand and minority interest capital contributions provided cash of thousand 
during  the cash provided was primarily from million of common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee stock options  offset by thousand in loan repayments 
principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term available for sale investments 
purchase commitments 
as of december   we had outstanding purchase commitments with our foundry vendors of million for delivery in we have recorded a liability of million for adverse purchase commitments 
lease commitments 
we have long term  non cancelable building lease commitments 
in and the second quarter of  we recorded charges to other operating expense of thousand and million  respectively  relating to operating leases for two unoccupied buildings 
these charges represent the estimated difference between the total discounted future sublease income and our discounted lease commitments relating to these buildings 
payments made on the lease have reduced the recorded combined liability to thousand and thousand at december  and  respectively 
future payments due under building lease  purchase commitments and other contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable operating leases   purchase commitments   other long term liability total   operating capital requirements 
we believe that our cash balances  together with funds we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not require us to seek additional borrowings or capital and  if so required  that such borrowing or capital will be available on acceptable terms 
factors that could affect our short term and long term cash used or generated from operations and as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include the average selling prices of our products  customer demand for our products  the need to secure future wafer production capacity from our suppliers  the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue  merger  acquisition or joint venture projects  unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  and the outcome of ongoing litigation 
please also see business risks our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenues may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued eitf issue no 
 or eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  we will evaluate the impact of eitf once final guidance is issued 
in october  the fasb approved eitf issue determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds which addresses an issue in the application of paragraph of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
in november  the fasb delayed until further notice the effective date of this issue 
we are currently assessing the impact of the disclosure requirements of eitf issue on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
are intended to improve financial reporting by clarifying that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and by requiring the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning after june  we are currently reviewing the impact of sfas no 
on the carrying amounts of our inventory 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r revised  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of fasb and supersedes apb no 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for good or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award over the period during which an employee is required to provide service for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments must be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
in addition  sfas r requires a public entity measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value and that the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
the effective date of sfas r for sst is for the first interim or annual period after june  although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated operating expenses 
business risks risks related to our business our operating results fluctuate materially  and an unanticipated decline in revenues may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
although we were profitable for the first three quarters of  we incurred net losses for and and the fourth quarter of our operating results have fluctuated significantly and our past financial performance should not be used to predict future operating results 
our recent quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  due to the following factors  all of which are difficult to forecast and many of which are out of our control the availability  timely delivery and cost of wafers or other manufacturing and assembly services from our suppliers  competitive pricing pressures and related changes in selling prices  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and significant yield losses  new product announcements and introductions of competing products by us or our competitors  product obsolescence  lower of cost or market  obsolescence or other inventory adjustments  changes in demand for  or in the mix of  our products  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of products utilizing our superflash technology  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed and the timeliness of receipt of distributor resale information  exchange rate fluctuations  general economic  political and environmental related conditions  such as natural disasters  increases in allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation allowances on deferred tax assets based on changes in estimated future taxable income  difficulties in forecasting  planning and management of inventory levels  unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  and the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue 
as recent experience confirms  a downturn in the market for products such as personal computers and cellular telephones that incorporate our products can also harm our operating results 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we therefore have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our revenues do not meet our projections 
we may experience revenue shortfalls for the following reasons sudden drops in consumer demand which may cause customers to cancel backlog  push out shipment schedules  or reduce new orders  possibly due to a slowing economy or inventory corrections among our customers  significant declines in selling prices that occur because of competitive price pressure during an over supply market environment  sudden shortages of raw materials for fabrication  test or assembly capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers which  in turn  harm our ability to meet our sales obligations  and the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders 
in addition  political or economic events beyond our control can suddenly result in increased operating costs 
for example  the terrorist attacks of september  have resulted in a substantial increase to our business insurance costs 
in addition  under a current proposed standard  we would be required to record compensation expense on stock option grants and on shares purchased under our employee stock purchase program  which would substantially increase our operating costs and impact our earnings loss per share 
we incurred significant inventory valuation and adverse purchase commitment adjustments in  and and we may incur additional significant inventory valuation adjustments in the future 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate materially 
the value of our inventory is dependent on our estimate of future average selling prices  and  if our projected average selling prices are over estimated  we may be required to adjust our inventory value to reflect the lower of cost or market 
as of december   we had million of inventory on hand  an increase of million  or  from december  total valuation adjustments to inventory and adverse purchase commitments were million in  million in and million in due to the large number of units in our inventory  even a small change in average selling prices could result in a significant adjustment and could harm our financial results 
some of our customers have requested that we ship them product that has a finished goods date of manufacture that is less than one year old 
as of december   our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories includes an allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than two years old and for certain products with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old 
in the event that this becomes a common requirement  it may be necessary for us to provide for an additional allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old  which could result in a significant adjustment and could harm our financial results 
cancellations or rescheduling of backlog may result in lower future revenue and harm our business 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue  could harm our business in the future 
we experienced a sharp downturn in several of our markets late in the fourth quarter of through  as our customers reacted to weakening demand for their products 
we began to experience a slow recovery during through the first half of during the second half of and the first half of  demand for our products increased sharply and we had improvements in the average selling prices of our products 
however  during the second half of  we experienced a demand slow down for our products 
our business could be harmed by industry wide fluctuations in the future 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales and operations 
during  and  our export product and licensing revenues accounted for  and of our net revenues  respectively 
our international business activities are subject to a number of risks  each of which could impose unexpected costs on us that would harm our operating results 
these risks include difficulties in complying with regulatory requirements and standards  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  reliance on third parties to distribute our products  extended accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  limits on repatriation of earnings  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
in addition  we have made equity investments in companies with operations in china  japan and taiwan 
the value of our investments is subject to the economic and political conditions particular to their industry  their countries and to foreign exchange rates and to the global economy 
if we determine that a change in the recorded value of an investment is other than temporary  we will adjust the value of the investment 
such an expense could have a negative impact on our operating results 
we derived  and of our net product revenues from asia during  and  respectively 
additionally  substantially all of our wafer suppliers and packaging and testing subcontractors are located in asia 
any kind of economic  political or environmental instability in this region of the world can have a severe negative impact on our operating results due to the large concentration of our production and sales activities in this region 
for example  during and  several asian countries where we do business  such as japan  taiwan and korea  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation  which negatively impacted our revenues and also negatively impacted our ability to collect payments from customers 
during this period  the lack of capital in the financial sectors of these countries made it difficult for our customers to open letters of credit or other financial instruments that are guaranteed by foreign banks 
finally  the economic situation during this period exacerbated a decline in selling prices for our products as our competitors reduced product prices to generate needed cash 
it should also be noted that we are greatly impacted by the political  economic and military conditions in taiwan 
taiwan and china are continuously engaged in political disputes and both countries have continued to conduct military exercises in or near the other s territorial waters and airspace 
such disputes may continue and even escalate  resulting in an economic embargo  a disruption in shipping or even military hostilities 
any of these events could delay production or shipment of our products 
any kind of activity of this nature or even rumors of such activity could harm our operations  revenues  operating results  and stock price 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  could harm our business 
terrorist attacks in the united states or abroad against american interests or citizens  us retaliation for these attacks  threats of additional terrorist activity and the war in iraq have caused our customer base to become more cautious 
any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers  distributors and suppliers  affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products  or affect the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
in addition  these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer spending in particular  which could harm our business 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers  and the loss of a major customer could harm our business 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers 
in addition  we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
in the past  when we have entered into a long term contract  the contract has generally been terminable at the convenience of the customer 
we depend on stocking representatives and distributors to generate a majority of our revenues 
we rely on stocking representatives and distributors to establish and maintain customer relationships and to sell our products 
these stocking representatives and distributors could discontinue their relationship with us or discontinue selling our products at any time 
the majority of our stocking representatives are located in asia 
the loss of our relationship with any stocking representative or distributor could harm our operating results by impairing our ability to sell our products to our end customers 
we depend on spt  our logistics center  to support many of our customers in asia 
since march  we have been increasing our out sourcing activities with our customer service logistics to support our customers 
currently spt supports our customers in taiwan  china and other southeast asia countries 
spt provides planning  warehousing  delivery  billing  collection and other logistic functions for us in these regions 
spt is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of our stocking representatives in taiwan  pct 
during  and  spt serviced end customer shipments accounted for  and of our net product revenues recognized  respectively 
as of december    and  spt accounted for  and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable 
for further description of our relationships with pct and spt  please refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation related party transactions 
we do not have any long term contracts with spt  pct or spac  and spt  pct or spac may cease providing services to us at any time 
if spt  pct or spac were to terminate their relationship with us we would experience a delay in reestablishing warehousing  logistics and distribution functions  which could impair our ability to collect accounts receivable from spt and may harm our business 
we depend on a limited number of foreign foundries to manufacture our products  and these foundries may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which could cause our revenues to decline 
we outsource substantially all of our manufacturing and testing activities 
we currently buy all of our wafers and sorted die from a limited number of suppliers 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by six foundries  tsmc in taiwan  sanyo  seiko epson and yasu in japan  grace in china  and samsung in korea 
in march  we invested million in gsmc  a cayman islands company  for a wafer foundry project located in shanghai  china 
in march  we invested an additional million in gsmc 
grace  a wholly owned subsidiary of gsmc  began manufacturing some of our products early in the fourth quarter of we anticipate that these foundries  together with shanghai hua hong nec electronic company limited  or hhnec  and vanguard in taiwan will manufacture substantially all of our products in if these suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive prices we could suffer manufacturing delays  a possible loss of revenues or higher than anticipated costs of revenues  any of which could harm our operating results 
our revenues may be impacted by our ability to obtain adequate wafer supplies from our foundries 
the foundries with which we currently have arrangements  together with any additional foundry at which capacity might be obtained  may not be willing or able to satisfy all of our manufacturing requirements on a timely basis at favorable prices 
in addition  we have encountered delays in qualifying new products and in ramping up new product production and we could experience these delays in the future 
we are also subject to the risks of service disruptions  raw material shortages and price increases by our foundries 
such disruptions  shortages and price increases could harm our operating results 
manufacturing capacity has in the past been difficult to secure and if capacity constraints arise in the future our revenues may decline 
in order to grow  we need to increase our present manufacturing capacity 
we currently believe that the existing capacity plus additional future capacity from grace  hhnec and vanguard available to us will be sufficient through however  events that we have not foreseen could arise which would limit our capacity 
similar to our million investment in gsmc  we may determine that it is necessary to invest substantial capital in order to secure appropriate production capacity commitments 
if we cannot secure additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired and our operating results will be harmed 
our cost of revenues may increase if we are required to purchase manufacturing capacity in the future 
to obtain additional manufacturing capacity  we may be required to make deposits  equipment purchases  loans  joint ventures  equity investments or technology licenses in or with wafer fabrication companies 
these transactions could involve a commitment of substantial amounts of our capital and technology licenses in return for production capacity 
we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing if we need substantial capital in order to secure this capacity and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor companies that supply our wafers have  from time to time  experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from marginal design or manufacturing process drift 
yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process  which often makes them difficult  time consuming and costly to correct 
furthermore  we rely on independent foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability  which could harm our operating results 
if our foundries discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade the technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may face production delays and lower revenues 
our wafer and product requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture our products 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a foundry will cease production on an older or lower volume manufacturing process that it uses to produce our parts 
additionally  we cannot be certain our foundries will continue to devote resources to advance the process technologies on which the manufacturing of our products is based 
either one of these events could increase our costs and harm our ability to deliver our products on time 
our dependence on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products subjects us to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher costs of materials 
we depend on independent subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of strong demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
these risks may lead to increased costs  delayed product delivery or loss of competitive advantage  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
because our flash memory products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues 
due to the flash memory product cycle we usually require more than nine months to realize volume shipments after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take three months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
we face intense competition from companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources that could harm sales of our products 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor memory components and have recently added significant capacity for such production 
our low density memory products  sales of which presently account for substantially all of our revenues  compete against products offered by spansion amd fujitsu  atmel  intel  macronix  stmicroelectronics  pmc and winbond 
our medium density memory products compete with products offered by spansion  intel  st microelectronics  mitsubishi  samsung  sharp electronics and toshiba 
if we are successful in developing our high density products  these products will compete principally with products offered by spansion amd fujitsu  atmel  fujitsu  hitachi  intel  mitsubishi  samsung  sandisk  sharp electronics  stmicroelectronics and toshiba  as well as any new entrants to the market 
in addition  we may in the future experience direct competition from our foundry partners 
we have licensed to our foundry partners the right to fabricate products based on our technology and circuit design  and to sell such products worldwide  subject to our receipt of royalty payments 
competition may also come from alternative technologies such as ferroelectric random access memory devices  or fram  or other developing technologies 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change and  therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and rapid product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their changing needs 
in addition  products for communications applications are based on continually evolving industry standards 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and incur significant expense to redesign our products and ensure compliance with relevant standards 
we believe that products for these applications will encounter intense competition and be highly price sensitive 
while we are currently developing and introducing new products for these applications  we cannot assure you that these products will reach the market on time  will satisfactorily address customer needs  will be sold in high volume  or will be sold at profitable margins 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
in addition  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm our operating results 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional personnel 
we are highly dependent on bing yeh  our president and chief executive officer  as well as the other principal members of our management team and engineering staff 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular the highly skilled design  applications and test engineers involved in the development of flash memory technology 
competition is especially intense in silicon valley  where our corporate headquarters is located 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of new management and engineering personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to recruit and retain key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could harm our business 
our ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secrets  copyrights  mask work rights  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products  however  is difficult  especially in foreign countries 
litigation may continue to be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
we own patents in the united states relating to our products and processes  with expiration dates ranging from to  and have filed for several more 
in addition  we hold several patents in europe and canada  and have filed several foreign patent applications in europe  japan  korea  taiwan and canada 
we cannot assure you that any pending patent application will be granted 
our operating results could be harmed by the failure to protect our intellectual property 
if we become engaged in securities class action suits and derivative suits  we may become subject to consuming and costly litigation and divert management resources and could impact our stock price 
securities class action law suits are often brought against companies  particularly technology companies  following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs and management resources in defending against such claims 
in january and february  multiple putative shareholder class action complaints were filed against us and certain directors and officers in the united states district court for the northern district of california  following our announcement of anticipated financial results for the fourth quarter of the complaints seek unspecified damages on alleged violations of federal securities laws during the period from march  to december  consolidation and the appointment of a lead plaintiff are currently pending in these purported class actions 
in january and february  following the filing of the putative class action lawsuits  multiple shareholder derivative complaints were filed in california superior court for the county of santa clara  purportedly on behalf of sst against certain directors and officers 
the factual allegations of these complaints are substantially identical to those contained in the putative shareholder class actions filed in federal court 
the derivative complaints assert claims for  among other things  breach of fiduciary duty and violations of the california corporations code 
public announcements may hurt our stock price 
during the course of lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
our litigation may be expensive  may be protracted and confidential information may be compromised 
we have incurred certain costs associated with defending these matters  and at any time  additional claims may be filed against us  which could increase the risk  expense and duration of the litigation 
further  because of the amount of discovery required in connection with this type of litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure

if we are accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose  we could suffer a significant impact on our business and be forced to pay damages 
third parties may assert that our products infringe their proprietary rights  or may assert claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
any such claims may cause us to delay or cancel shipment of our products or pay damages that could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
in the past we were sued both by atmel corporation and intel corporation regarding patent infringement issues and sued winbond electronics corporation regarding our contractual relationship with them 
significant management time and financial resources have been devoted to defending these lawsuits 
we settled with intel in may  with winbond in october  and the atmel litigation is ongoing 
in addition to the atmel  intel and winbond actions  we receive from time to time  letters or communications from other companies stating that such companies have patent rights that involve our products 
since the design of all of our products is based on superflash technology  any legal finding that the use of our superflash technology infringes the patent of another company would have a significantly negative effect on our entire product line and operating results 
furthermore  if such a finding were made  there can be no assurance that we could license the other company s technology on commercially reasonable terms or that we could successfully operate without such technology 
moreover  if we are found to infringe  we could be required to pay damages to the owner of the protected technology and could be prohibited from making  using  selling  or importing into the united states any products that infringe the protected technology 
in addition  the management attention consumed by and legal cost associated with any litigation could harm our operating results 
public announcements may hurt our stock price 
during the course of lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
our litigation may be expensive  may be protracted and confidential information may be compromised 
on april   a jury found that we willfully infringed atmel s and patents  and awarded atmel million in actual damages 
on may   the court entered judgment in the total amount of million  which includes the original million 
the and patents expired in february therefore  we are not precluded from selling any of our products 
on december   we paid atmel million to satisfy the judgement plus statutory interest accrued during the appeal 
the patent case still remains open 
the court found that we infringed the patent but the jury was unable to unanimously decide whether the is valid and a mistrial was declared 
a settlement conference scheduled for april  was rescheduled for september  no conclusion was reached during the settlement conference on september  a new trial date on the invalidity of the patent has been scheduled for june  if we are not successful in reaching a settlement  litigation may continue to consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources 
we have incurred certain costs associated with defending this matter  and at any time atmel may file additional claims against us  which could increase the risk  expense and duration of the litigation 
further  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with this type of litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure

if an earthquake or other natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility or those of our suppliers  we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost revenues 
our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults 
in addition  some of our suppliers are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters  our operations could be harmed 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster such as typhoon near one or more of our major suppliers  like the earthquakes in september and march or the typhoon in september that occurred in taiwan  could potentially disrupt the operations of those suppliers  which could then limit the supply of our products and harm our business 
a virus or viral outbreak in asia could harm our business 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from asia and our logistics center is located in taiwan 
a virus or viral outbreak in asia  such as the recent sars outbreak in early  could harm the operations of our suppliers  distributors  logistics center and those of our end customer  which could harm our business 
prolonged electrical power outages  energy shortages  or increased costs of energy could harm our business 
our design and process research and development facilities and our corporate offices are located in california  which is susceptible to power outages and shortages as well as increased energy costs 
to limit this exposure  all corporate computer systems at our main california facilities are on battery back up 
in addition  all of our engineering and back up servers and selected corporate servers are on generator back up 
while the majority of our production facilities are not located in california  more extensive power shortages in the state could delay our design and process research and development as well as increase our operating costs 
our growth has in the past placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources and if we fail to manage our growth  our ability to market or sell our products or develop new products may be harmed 
our business has in the past experienced rapid growth which strained our internal systems and future growth will require us to continuously develop sophisticated information management systems in order to manage our business effectively 
we recently implemented a supply chain management system and a vendor electronic data interface system 
there is no guarantee that these measures  in themselves  will be adequate to address any growth  or that we will be able to foresee in a timely manner other infrastructure needs before they arise 
our success depends on the ability of our executive officers to effectively manage our growth 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our results of operations will be harmed 
if we fail to successfully implement new management information systems  our business may suffer severe inefficiencies that may harm the results of our operations 
future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  changes requiring that we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for stock options using the fair value method or any changes in existing taxation rules related to stock options could have a significant negative effect on our reported results 
the fasb has issued changes to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states that  when implemented the third quarter of  will require us to record charges to earnings for the stock options we grant 
evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty changing laws  regulations and standard relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules are creating uncertainty for public companies 
we continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we have invested resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and we may be harmed 
we  and our independent registered public accounting firm  have determined that we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the year ended december  and will continue to do so for future fiscal periods 
we may encounter problems or delays in completing the review and evaluation  the implementation of improvements and the receipt of a positive attestation  or any attestation at all  by our independent auditors 
additionally  management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify deficiencies that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors 
as of december   we did not maintain effective control over accounting for and review of the valuation of inventory  the income tax provision and related balance sheet accounts and licensing revenue because the company lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements 
specifically  we lacked sufficient controls over the write down of inventory to its lower of cost or market  accounting for complex licensing contracts with multiple elements  and processes and procedures related to the determination and review of the quarterly and annual tax provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
this control deficiency resulted in an audit adjustment to the consolidated financial statements related to the write down of inventory to the lower of cost or market 
additionally  this deficiency could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected 
accordingly  management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness 
because of this material weakness  our management concluded that  as of december   we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on those criteria 
as a result  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  has issued an adverse opinion with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting and their report is included in this form k 
should we  or our independent registered public accounting firm  determine in future fiscal periods that we have additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  the reliability of our financial reports may be impacted  and our results of operations or financial condition may be harmed and the price of our common stock may decline 
acquisitions could result in operating difficulties  dilution and other harmful consequences 
in september we acquired majority ownership in emosyn and in november we acquired substantially all of the assets of g plus 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations  acquisitions and dispositions of businesses  technologies  services  products and other assets  including interests in our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures 
at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of such transactions 
any of such transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction 
the process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time  as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products  declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls  procedures and policies  and in some cases  the need to transition operations onto our platforms 
international acquisitions involve additional risks  including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages  currency risks  and the particular economic  political  and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 
moreover  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions 
as a result of future acquisitions or mergers  we might need to issue additional equity securities  spend our cash  or incur debt  contingent liabilities  or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business 
risks related to our industry our success is dependent on the growth and strength of the flash memory market 
substantially all of our products  as well as all new products currently under design  are stand alone flash memory devices or devices embedded with flash memory 
a memory technology other than superflash may be adopted as an industry standard 
our competitors are generally in a better financial and marketing position than we are from which to influence industry acceptance of a particular memory technology 
in particular  a primary source of competition may come from alternative technologies such as fram devices if such technology is commercialized for higher density applications 
to the extent our competitors are able to promote a technology other than superflash as an industry standard  our business will be seriously harmed 
the selling prices for our products are extremely volatile and have historically declined during periods of over capacity or industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by periodic changes in business conditions caused by product supply and demand imbalance 
when the industry experiences downturns  they often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns are characterized by weak product demand  excessive inventory and accelerated declines of average selling prices 
in some cases  downturns  such as the one we experienced from late through  have lasted for more than a year 
our business could be further harmed by industry wide prolonged downturns in the future 
the flash memory products portion of the semiconductor industry  from which we derive substantially all of our revenues  suffered from excess capacity in   and in late  which resulted in greater than normal declines in our markets  which unfavorably impacted our revenues  gross margins and profitability 
while these conditions began to improve during the third quarter of  deteriorating market conditions at the end of through the first part and again in the fourth quarter of have resulted in the decline of our selling prices and harmed our operating results 
there is seasonality in our business and if we fail to continue to introduce new products this seasonality may become more pronounced 
sales of our products in the consumer electronics applications market are subject to seasonality 
as a result  sales of these products are impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of each year 
in the past we have been able to mitigate such seasonality with the introduction of new products throughout the year 
if we fail to continue to introduce new products  our business may suffer and the seasonality of a portion of our sales may become more pronounced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
currently  we do not hedge these foreign exchange rate exposures 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce revenues and or result in operating losses 
in addition  a downturn in the economies of china  japan or taiwan could impair the value of our equity investments in companies with operations in these countries 
if we consider the value of these companies to be impaired  we will write off  or expense  some or all of our investments 
in  we wrote down our investment in kye by million to million due to an other than temporary decline in its market value 
as of december   the recorded value of our kye investment was million based on the quoted market price 
in the third quarter of  we wrote down our investment in apacer  a privately held memory module manufacturer located in taiwan  by million due to an other than temporary decline in its value 
as of december   the recorded value of our apacer investment was million 
during  we wrote down our investment in insyde by thousand because insyde s stock price had declined below the acquisition cost for more than six months 
the impairment was considered to be other than temporary in nature 
in addition  we have equity investments in companies with operations in china  japan  taiwan and united states with recorded values at december  of million  million  million and million  respectively 
at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  or the fair value of our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of december  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
as of december   the carrying value of our available for sale investments approximated fair value 
the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our unrestricted and restricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments as of december  in thousands ca rrying interest value rate short term available for sale investments fixed rate cash and cash equivalents variable rate
