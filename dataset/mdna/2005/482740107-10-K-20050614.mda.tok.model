item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and liquidity and capital resources except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed throughout this report and specifically under the captions cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and risk factors 
in addition  the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
background we are a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company that develops  acquires  manufactures and markets technologically distinguished branded and generic non branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
we have a broad range of dosage form capabilities  including tablets  capsules  creams  liquids and ointments 
we conduct our branded pharmaceutical operations through ther rx corporation and our generic non branded pharmaceutical operations through ethex corporation  which focuses principally on technologically distinguished generic products 
through particle dynamics  inc  we develop  manufacture and market technologically advanced  value added raw material products for the pharmaceutical  nutritional  personal care  food and other markets 
we have a broad portfolio of drug delivery technologies which we leverage to create technologically distinguished brand name and specialty generic products 
we have developed and patented drug delivery and formulation technologies primarily in four principal areas site release r bioadhesives  oral controlled release  tastemasking and oral quick dissolving tablets 
we incorporate these technologies in the products we market to control and improve the absorption and utilization of active pharmaceutical compounds 
these technologies provide a number of benefits  including reduced frequency of administration  reduced side effects  improved drug efficacy  enhanced patient compliance and improved taste 
our drug delivery technologies allow us to differentiate our products in the marketplace  both in the branded and generic pharmaceutical areas 
we believe that this differentiation provides substantial competitive advantages for our products  allowing us to establish a strong record of growth and profitability and a leadership position in certain segments of our industry 
results of operations in fiscal  net revenues increased as we experienced sales growth compared to fiscal in all three of our operating segments branded products  specialty generics and specialty materials 
our sales growth in fiscal was constrained by slower than anticipated anda approvals by the fda on two brand equivalent products that we expected to introduce in the fourth quarter of fiscal and delays in the timing of other certain approvals during the year 
we expect these approvals will be received in the second half of fiscal sales of our branded segment also were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter by a shortage of raw material for one of our products 
the million increase in gross profit was more than offset by an increase in operating expenses of million 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to greater personnel expenses associated with an increase in management personnel and expansion of the branded sales force  an increase in branded marketing expense primarily related to the approval and introduction of the company s second nda product clindesse tm  increases in professional fees and legal expenses  and an increase in research and development expense 
as a result  net income decreased million  or  to million compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other   total net revenues    the increase in branded product sales was due primarily to the introduction of clindesse tm in the fourth quarter of fiscal  continued growth of gynazole r and increased sales of our two hematinic brands 
the introduction of clindesse tm  a single dose prescription cream therapy indicated to treat bacterial vaginosis  contributed million of incremental sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal since its launch in january  clindesse tm has garnered of the intravaginal bacterial vaginosis market in the united states 
sales of gynazole  our vaginal antifungal cream product  increased million  or  to million during fiscal as our share of the prescription vaginal antifungal cream market increased to at the end of fiscal  from at the end of the prior year 
sales from our two hematinic product lines  chromagen r and niferex r  increased to million during fiscal as both product lines experienced significant growth in new prescriptions filled 
during the year  new prescription growth for chromagen r and niferex r was and  respectively  compared to the prior year 
also included in branded product sales is the precare r product line which contributed million of sales during fiscal although sales of our precare r product line declined during the year  the precare r family of products continued to be the leading branded line of prescription prenatal nutritional supplements in the united states 
the million decrease in sales of our precare r product line was partially the result of a temporary fourth quarter supply disruption of primacare r one  our proprietary line extension to primacare r  that was launched in the second quarter 
prior to the occurrence of this supply issue  which has since been resolved  primacare r one generated million of incremental sales in fiscal the increase in branded product sales for fiscal was partially offset by a million decline in sales of our micro k r product line 
the growth in specialty generic sales resulted from million of incremental sales volume from new product introductions  principally in our lower margin cough cold product line  coupled with million of increased sales volume from existing products in our cardiovascular and pain management product lines 
these increases were offset in part by product price erosion of million principally in the second half of the fiscal year  that resulted from pricing pressures on certain products in the cardiovascular  pain management and cough cold product lines 
although specialty generic sales increased in fiscal  we experienced a million  or  decline in sales for the three months ended march  this decrease resulted from a significant decline in cardiovascular products sales due in part to the absence of trade shows that occurred in the fourth quarter of the prior year and resulted in an unfavorable mix in product categories in the fourth quarter of fiscal the anticipated approval of diltiazem and another product in the fourth quarter of fiscal  would have more than offset the above decrease  had the approvals been received 
we now expect them to be launched in the second half of fiscal the increase in specialty material product sales was primarily due to renewed focus on expanding the specialty materials business  the addition of a new major customer in fiscal that resulted in million of incremental sales and an increased emphasis on international markets that provided additional sales of million in fiscal gross profit by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other    total gross profit    as of total net revenues the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the sales growth experienced by all three of our segments branded products  specialty generics and specialty materials 
the lower gross profit percentage on a consolidated basis primarily reflected the impact of price erosion on certain specialty generic products beginning in the second quarter and extending through the balance of fiscal  offset in part by certain selective price increases taken near the end of the third quarter 
the gross profit percentage decline experienced by the specialty generics segment was offset in part by a shift in the mix of branded product sales toward higher margin products with the introduction of clindesse tm in the fourth quarter coupled with improved pricing and lower raw material costs at our specialty materials business 
research and development years ended march  change in thousands research and development    as of net revenues the increase in research and development expense primarily resulted from increased spending on bioequivalency studies for products in our internal development pipeline and higher personnel expenses related to the growth of our research and development staff 
in may  we announced an agreement with femmepharma to terminate the license agreement we entered into with them in april as part of this transaction  we acquired femmepharma for million after the assets of the entity had been distributed to femmepharma s other shareholders 
included in our acquisition of femmepharma are all of the worldwide marketing rights to an endometriosis product that has successfully completed phase ii clinical trials and was originally part of the licensing arrangement with femmepharma 
in connection with this transaction  we expect to incur an in process research and development charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal  which includes the write off of the million payment plus preferred stock investments previously made 
selling and administrative years ended march  change in thousands selling and administrative    as of net revenues the increase in selling and administrative expense was due primarily to greater personnel expenses resulting from an increase in management personnel million and expansion of the branded sales force million including approximately million for sales representatives added during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a million increase in branded marketing and promotions expense commensurate with the growth of the segment  a million increase in rent  depreciation  insurance and utilities expense associated with expansion of our office facilities over the past two years  a million increase in professional fees associated primarily with implementation of the internal control provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  a million increase in legal expense  and million of costs incurred in the fourth quarter to support the launch of clindesse tm 
the increase in legal expense was due to an increase in litigation activity  which included various patent infringement actions brought by potential competitors with respect to products we propose to market and for which we have submitted anda filings and provided notice of certification required under the provisions of the hatch waxman act 
amortization of intangible assets years ended march  change in thousands amortization of intangible assets   as of net revenues the increase in amortization of intangible assets was due primarily to the amortization of license costs incurred under a co development arrangement in fiscal litigation years ended march  change in thousands litigation   the million of income reflected in litigation consists of a million net payment received by us in accordance with a favorable legal settlement of vitamin antitrust litigation and million related to the reversal of excess reserves related to the healthpoint litigation see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the second quarter of the prior year  we received million for settlement with a branded company of our claim that the branded company interfered with our right to a timely introduction of a generic product in a previous fiscal year 
the impact of this payment was offset in part by an additional litigation reserve of million related to attorneys fees awarded in the healthpoint matter  which subsequently was settled 
operating income years ended march  change in thousands operating income    the decrease in operating income resulted primarily from a million  or  increase in selling and administrative expense coupled with a million increase in research and development expense  offset in part by a million increase in gross profit 
interest expense years ended march  change in thousands interest expense   the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the level of capitalized interest recorded on capital projects that we have in process 
interest and other income years ended march  change in thousands interest and other income   the increase in interest and other income was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate earned on short term investments  offset in part by a decline in the average balance of short term investments 
provision for income taxes years ended march  change in thousands provision for income taxes    effective tax rate the decrease in the provision for income taxes resulted from a corresponding decrease in income before taxes coupled with a decline in the effective tax rate 
the decline in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from the implementation of various tax planning initiatives  as well as the generation of income tax credits at both the federal and state levels 
net income and diluted earnings per share years ended march  change in thousands net income    diluted earnings per share the decrease in net income resulted primarily from a million  or  increase in selling and administrative expense coupled with a million increase in research and development expense  offset in part by a million increase in gross profit 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials   as of net revenues other    total net revenues    the increase in branded product sales was due primarily to continued growth of our women s healthcare family of products and the sales impact of products acquired by us on march  the increase was also impacted by a march  price increase instituted by ther rx on all of its products 
in anticipation of the scheduled price increase  customers made larger than normal purchases  which the company limits to a day supply and is consistent with prior price increase policies 
this forward purchasing approximated million during the fourth quarter 
sales from the women s healthcare product group increased million  or  in fiscal included in the women s healthcare family of products is the precare r product line which contributed million of incremental sales in fiscal this increase was attributable to increased sales volume associated with higher market shares for primacare r  our prescription prenatal postnatal multivitamin and mineral supplement with essential fatty acids  and the precare r prenatal vitamin 
the precare r family of products continues to be the leading branded line of prescription prenatal nutritional supplements in the united states as market share for the product line grew to at the end of fiscal compared to at the end of fiscal sales of gynazole r  our vaginal antifungal cream product  increased million  or  during fiscal as our share of the prescription vaginal antifungal cream market increased to at the end of fiscal  from at the end of the prior year 
the increase in sales from our women s healthcare family of products was supplemented by million of sales during fiscal from our two hematinic product lines  chromagen r and niferex r  and the strongstart r prenatal vitamin product line that we acquired at the end of fiscal introduction of technology improved versions of the hematinic products in the second quarter of fiscal  generated growth in new prescription volume 
the increase in branded product sales for fiscal was partially offset by a million decline in sales of the micro k r product line 
the minimal growth in specialty generic sales resulted from million of incremental sales volume from new product introductions  primarily in the cough cold  cardiovascular and prenatal vitamin product lines  offset by a million decline in sales volume from existing products primarily in our cough cold product line 
during fiscal  we introduced new products  including the february anda approval for four strengths of benazepril hydrochloride tablets generic equivalent to lotensin r 
the decline in sales of existing cough cold products was due primarily to an fda order which required us and all manufacturers of unapproved single ingredient  extended release guaifenesin products to discontinue distribution of these products after november the fda ruling affected five of our guaifenesin products that were first introduced when anda approval was not required 
also  we experienced slower than anticipated anda approvals by the fda on a number of brand equivalent products that we expected to introduce in fiscal the decrease in specialty material product sales was primarily due to a slowdown in a major customer s business in the vitamin supplement market 
the decrease in other revenue resulted from a smaller contract manufacturing customer base due to continued de emphasis of this lower margin operation in our business strategy 
gross profit by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials   as of net revenues other  total gross profit    as of total net revenues the increase in consolidated gross profit was primarily attributable to the sales growth experienced by the branded products and specialty generics segments  offset in part by a sales decline in the specialty materials segment 
the increased gross profit percentage on a consolidated basis reflected a favorable shift in the mix of product sales toward higher margin branded products  which comprised a larger percentage of net revenues 
the gross profit percentage decrease experienced by the branded products segment was due to the acquired hematinic products  which have a slightly lower gross margin than other products in the branded line 
while the gross profit percentage in specialty generics increased for the fiscal year  the segment experienced a decline in gross profit as a percent of net revenues during the fourth quarter due to more competitive pricing and higher costs associated with a new product launch 
gross profit as a percent of net revenues also declined in the specialty raw materials segment during the fourth quarter as a result of unfavorable costs variances associated with lower production volume 
research and development years ended march  change in thousands research and development    as of net revenues the increase in research and development expense resulted from higher costs associated with the continued expansion of clinical testing for our product development efforts and increased personnel expenses related to the growth of our research and development staff 
the increase in research and development expense was below management s expectation of greater spending due to rescheduling the timing of certain clinical studies 
selling and administrative years ended march  change in thousands selling and administrative    as of net revenues the increase in selling and administrative expense was due primarily to greater personnel expenses resulting from an increase in management personnel million and expansion of the branded sales force million  an increase in rent  depreciation and utilities associated with recently added facilities million  and an increase in branded marketing expense million commensurate with the growth of the segment and to support the launch and on going promotion of technology improved versions of the chromagen r and niferex r products we acquired at the end of fiscal we also experienced a million increase in legal expense due to an increase in litigation activity coupled with the appeal of the healthpoint litigation  paragraph iv litigation and other matters 
amortization of intangible assets years ended march  change in thousands amortization of intangible assets    as of net revenues the increase in amortization of intangible assets was due primarily to the amortization of trademarks acquired in the two product acquisitions completed on march  litigation years ended march  change in thousands litigation    in september  we recorded a litigation reserve of million for potential damages associated with the adverse decision made by a federal court in texas to uphold a jury verdict in a lawsuit against ethex 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional litigation reserve of million related to this matter for attorney s fees awarded to the plaintiffs by the court 
the impact of this reserve was more than offset by a million net payment  received by us during fiscal  for a settlement with a branded company of our claim that the branded company interfered with our right to a timely introduction of a generic product in a previous fiscal year 
operating income years ended march  change in thousands operating income    the increase in operating income resulted primarily from a million  or  increase in gross profit in fiscal  offset in part by a million increase in fiscal operating expenses 
the million increase in our fiscal selling and administrative expenses was primarily offset by the impact on fiscal operating expenses of a million litigation reserve established by us for potential damages associated with a lawsuit that was settled in fiscal interest expense years ended march  change in thousands interest expense    the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the interest expense accrued on the million of convertible subordinated notes issued may  interest and other income years ended march  change in thousands interest and other income   the increase in interest and other income was due to the investment of million of net proceeds from the may convertible subordinated notes offering in short term  highly liquid investments combined with the impact of an million increase in short term investments during fiscal from the proceeds of a secondary offering during that year 
provision for income taxes years ended march  change in thousands provision for income taxes    effective tax rate the increase in the provision for income taxes resulted from a corresponding increase in income before taxes 
the decline in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from the implementation of various tax planning initiatives  as well as the generation of income tax credits at both the federal and state levels 
net income and diluted earnings per share years ended march  change in thousands net income    diluted earnings per share the increase in net income resulted primarily from a million  or  increase in our fiscal net revenues coupled with the impact on fiscal net income of a million litigation reserve established by us in september for potential damages associated with a lawsuit that was settled in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and working capital were million and million  respectively  at march   compared to million and million  respectively  at march  internally generated funds from product sales was the primary source of operating capital used in the funding of our businesses in fiscal net cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal compared to in fiscal cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by net income adjusted for non cash items and an increase in accounts payable related to the timing of payments  offset in part by the million payment attributable to settlement of the healthpoint litigation 
in september  we made a settlement payment in the amount of million to resolve all previously pending claims between us and healthpoint  ltd 
without the admission of any liability 
the settlement was fully reserved by us in september and therefore had no impact on our earnings in fiscal the million of income reflected in litigation for the year ended march  represents a reversal of the portion of the healthpoint litigation reserve that remained after payment of the settlement amount and related litigation costs 
net cash flow used in investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures of million in fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
capital expenditures in fiscal were primarily for building renovation projects and for purchasing machinery and equipment to upgrade and expand our pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
other investing activities in fiscal included million in purchases of marketable securities that are classified as available for sale 
in the prior year  we made cash payments of million in april to complete the acquisition of the niferex r product line and million in january to femmepharma  inc to complete the licensing of certain trademark rights and to increase our equity investment in the company 
our debt balance was million at march  compared to million at march  in may  we issued million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes that are convertible  under certain circumstances  into shares of our class a common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the convertible subordinated notes bear interest at a rate of and mature on may  we are also obligated to pay contingent interest at a rate equal to per annum during any six month period commencing may   if the average trading price of the notes per  principal amount for the five trading day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals  or more 
we may redeem some or all of the convertible subordinated notes at any time on or after may   at a redemption price  payable in cash  of of the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest  if any to the date of redemption 
holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible subordinated notes on may     and  or upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture governing the convertible subordinated notes  at of the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest  if any to the date of repurchase  payable in cash 
the convertible subordinated notes are subordinate to all of our existing and future senior obligations 
on march   we repaid the second of two million promissory notes entered into in conjunction with the altana acquisition agreement see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  we increased our available credit facilities to million 
the revised agreement provided for an increase from million to million in our revolving line of credit along with an increase from million to million in the supplemental credit line that is available for financing acquisitions 
these credit facilities expire in october and december  respectively 
the revolving and supplemental credit lines are unsecured and interest is charged at the lower of the prime rate or the one month libor rate plus basis points 
at march   we had million in open letters of credit issued under the revolving credit line and no cash borrowings under either credit facility 
the revised agreement contains substantially identical financial and other covenants  representations  warranties  conditions and default provisions as the replaced facility 
the financial covenants impose minimum levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  a maximum funded debt ratio  a limit on capital expenditures and dividend payments  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio 
as of march   we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations in thousands less than more than total year years years years obligations at march  long term debt obligations     operating lease obligations     other long term obligations   total contractual cash obligations a      a the company has licensed the exclusive rights to co develop and market various generic equivalent products with other drug delivery companies 
these collaboration agreements require the company to make up front and ongoing payments as development milestones are attained 
if all milestones remaining under these agreements were reached  payments by the company could total up to  we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance  cash flows from operations and funds available under our credit facilities  will be adequate to fund operating activities for the presently foreseeable future  including the payment of short term and long term debt obligations  capital improvements  research and development expenditures  product development activities and expansion of marketing capabilities for the branded pharmaceutical business 
in addition  we continue to examine opportunities to expand our business through the acquisition of or investment in companies  technologies  product rights  research and development and other investments that are compatible with our existing businesses 
we intend to use our available cash to help in funding any acquisitions or investments 
as such  cash has been invested in short term  highly liquid instruments 
we also may use funds available under our credit facility  or financing sources that subsequently become available  including the future issuances of additional debt or equity securities  to fund these acquisitions or investments 
if we were to fund one or more such acquisitions or investments  our capital resources  financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted in future periods 
inflation inflation may apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us in the future 
however  we believe that the net effect of inflation on our operations during the past three years has been minimal 
in addition  changes in the mix of products sold and the effect of competition has made a comparison of changes in selling prices less meaningful relative to changes in the overall rate of inflation over the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  information that is obtained from customers and outside sources  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
our critical accounting estimates are described below 
revenue and provision for sales returns and allowances 
revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accordingly  we record revenue from product sales when title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer  which is typically upon shipment to the customer 
we also enter into long term agreements under which we assign marketing rights for the products we have developed to pharmaceutical marketers 
royalties under these arrangements are earned based on the sale of products 
when we sell our products  we reduce the amount of revenue we recognize from such sales by an estimate of future product returns and sales allowances 
sales allowances include cash discounts  rebates  chargebacks  and other similar expected future payments relating to products sold in the current period 
factors that are considered in our estimates of future product returns and sales allowances include historical payment experience in relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels  and current contract prices and terms with both direct and indirect customers 
if actual future payments for product returns and sales allowances exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
we establish contract prices for indirect customers who are supplied by our wholesale customers 
a chargeback represents the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect customer s contract price  which is lower 
we credit the wholesaler for purchases by indirect customers at the lower price 
accordingly  we record these chargebacks at the time we recognize revenue in connection with our sales to wholesalers 
provisions for estimating chargebacks are calculated primarily using historical chargeback experience  actual contract pricing and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
we continually monitor our assumptions  giving consideration to estimated wholesaler inventory levels and current pricing trends  and make adjustments to these estimates when we believe that the actual chargeback amounts payable in the future will differ from our original estimates 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist of finished goods held for distribution  raw materials and work in process 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out basis 
in evaluating whether inventory is to be stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time required to sell existing inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we establish reserves  when necessary  for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon our historical experience and management s assessment of current product demand 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our intangible assets consist of product rights  license agreements and trademarks resulting from product acquisitions and legal fees and similar costs relating to the development of patents and trademarks 
intangible assets that are acquired are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
upon approval  costs associated with the development of patents and trademarks are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from five to years 
we determine amortization periods for intangible assets that are acquired based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products 
such factors include the product s position in its life cycle  the existence or absence of like products in the market  various other competitive and regulatory issues  and contractual terms 
significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the intangible asset s useful life and an acceleration of related amortization expense 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability 
recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an intangible asset against an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the intangible asset 
contingencies 
the company is involved in various legal proceedings  some of which involve claims for substantial amounts 
an estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in legal proceedings could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
after review  it was determined at march  that for each of the various legal proceedings in which we are involved  the conditions mentioned above were not met 
we will continue to evaluate all legal matters as additional information becomes available 
recently issued accounting standards in march  the eitf completed its discussion of and provided consensus guidance on issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share 
the consensus interpreted the definition of a participating security  required the use of the two class method in the calculation and disclosure of basic earnings per share for companies with participating securities or more than one class of common stock  and provided guidance on the allocation of earnings and losses for purposes of calculating basic earnings per share 
since the company has two classes of common stock  this consensus has been applied in the calculation of basic earnings per share for all periods presented 
there was no impact on diluted earnings per share as reported 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  disclosure requirements under fasb statement no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  relating to contingently convertible securities 
this fsp requires the disclosure provisions of statement to apply to all existing and newly created contingently convertible securities and to their potentially dilutive effects on earnings per share 
the adoption of the disclosure provisions of fsp did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus that contingently convertible debt instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent feature has been met 
additionally  the eitf stated that prior period earnings per share amounts presented for comparative purposes should be restated to conform to this consensus  which is effective for reporting periods ending after december  the consensus adopted by the eitf required the addition of approximately million shares associated with the conversion of the company s million principal amount convertible subordinated notes to the number of shares outstanding for the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all reported periods since the issuance of the notes 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment to arb no 
 chapter which requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently determining the impact  if any  the adoption of this statement will have on its financial condition and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and modified retrospective adoption options 
under the modified retrospective option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the modified retrospective method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in april  the securities and exchange commission announced an amendment to regulation s x to amend the date for compliance with sfas r 
the amendment requires each registrant that is not a small business issuer to adopt sfas r in the first fiscal year commencing after june  as a result  we are required to adopt sfas r beginning april  adoption of sfas r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  as we will be required to expense the fair value of our employee stock option grants rather than disclose the pro forma impact on our consolidated net income within the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements  as is our current practice 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness that is subject to interest rate changes 
advances to us under our credit facilities bear interest at a rate that varies consistent with increases or decreases in the publicly announced prime rate and or the libor rate with respect to libor related loans  if any 
a material increase in such rates could significantly increase borrowing expenses 
we did not have any cash borrowings under our credit facilities at march  in may  we issued million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
the interest rate on the convertible subordinated notes is fixed at per annum and not subject to market interest rate changes 
beginning may   we will become obligated to pay contingent interest at a rate equal to per annum during any six month period  if the average trading price of the convertible subordinated notes per  principal amount for the five trading day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals  or more 
in april  we entered into an million term loan secured by a building under a floating rate loan with a bank 
we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the same bank  which fixed the interest rate of the building mortgage at for the term of the loan
