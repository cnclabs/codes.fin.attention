item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include statements about trends and uncertainties in our business  such as our expectations about our liquidity  flash memory supply  pricing strategy  plans to manufacture new flash memory products  and expected future trends in component costs and operating expense levels 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risks that could affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and market high performance digital media as well as other flash based storage products for consumer markets that utilize digital media for the capture and retrieval of digital content for the digital photography  consumer electronics  computer  industrial and communications markets 
our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards with a range of speeds  capacities and special features to satisfy the various demands of different users of flash cards 
to address the growing market for compact digital data and media storage solutions  our digital media products also include our jumpdrive products  which are high speed  portable usb flash drives for consumer applications that serve a variety of uses  including floppy disk replacement  as well as our line of digital music players  which are both portable mp players and storage devices 
in addition  we market a variety of connectivity products that link our media products to pcs and other electronic host devices 
we also license our proprietary controller technology and sell controllers to other manufacturers of flash storage media 
the average gross selling price per megabyte of our digital media products declined from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of our component costs did not decrease as quickly as market pricing  which resulted in our reporting a significant loss in both the fourth quarter and the full year of we are now trying to ensure that our pricing strategy going forward reflects our intention to focus on profitability 
we have significantly reduced promotional programs and increased prices on certain products to most of our customers to better align our selling prices with our cost structure 
in addition  we are planning to emphasize more of our premium products  which have higher margins 
as a result  we do not expect to continue to aggressively match product price declines unless and until our product costs adjust in a way that allows us to sell our products profitably 
our resellers may not accept these price increases and may decide to reduce their orders  purchase from other vendors or return unsold product to us 
in the past several months  we have lost product placements to our competitors at wal mart  comp usa and other resellers in part because of our pricing strategy 
at wal mart  which accounted for more than of our gross revenue in  we may experience a significant decline in sales due to the addition of other vendors 
in order to meet the expected demand for our products  we are also focused on efforts to ensure that our costs for flash memory and components will enable us to sell our products at competitive prices  that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations  that our supply of flash memory and flash card components is sufficient to meet our anticipated supply needs  that our supply chain can support our expected rates of growth and that we have sufficient engineering resources to design the products demanded by our customers 
in the second quarter of  our component costs did not decrease as quickly as market pricing  which resulted in our reporting a net loss for the second quarter 
during the third quarter of supply and demand came into better balance  and as new flash memory suppliers entered the market  our costs came into line with market pricing resulting in improved margins 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced rapid decreases in market pricing for our products  which resulted in our reporting a substantial net loss for the fourth quarter and starting in the fourth quarter of  we determined that due to the recent high volatility of prices in the retail market  we are 
table of contents no longer able to reasonably estimate the level of revenue allowances and product returns  and accordingly  we became unable to determine the selling price of our products at the time the sale takes place 
as a result  effective october   for all of our retail customers  revenues and the cost of revenues are deferred until these customers have either sold the product to their customers or a time period that is reasonably estimated to allow these customers to sell the product to their customers has elapsed 
the change in the timing of recognizing revenue related to all resellers now on a sell through basis  some of which were previously recognized on a sell to basis  had the initial one time effect of reducing net revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of by million  reducing gross margin by million  and increasing net loss by million 
as of december  and december   deferred product margin from sales to resellers was million and million  respectively 
during the second quarter of  we began to diversify our suppliers of flash memory 
however  most of the flash supply from new suppliers is to date lower density chips  which are only cost effective for use in manufacturing lower capacity cards 
we expect that samsung and toshiba will dominate the market for high density flash chips for at least the next twelve months as new flash memory suppliers generally expect to begin their production with lower density products and transition to producing higher density chips over a period of time 
the rapid price declines during strained our operations and financial resources 
during periods of rapid price declines  we must manage our internal  consignment and channel inventory carefully while balancing the need to meet the demands of our customers quickly 
any reduction in prices by us will hurt our gross margin unless we can manage our internal  consignment and channel inventories and our cost structure to minimize the impact of such price declines and reduce our costs 
as a result  we are actively focusing our planning efforts to optimize our supply chain and reduce our inventories 
this includes adjusting our business model to build products to a buffer inventory based on when our customers order those products rather than build products to forecast and in advance of receiving orders from our customers 
our build to buffer based on orders model will still include certain inventory to enable us to adequately support our customers 
in addition  we are working with our suppliers to reduce our cycle times and reduce the component and assembly cost of our products 
we are also expecting to rationalize the number of products we offer to the market in order to make our internal and channel inventory management more effective 
we are also focused on expanding our distribution channels  particularly internationally  and trying to ensure that our products are available at outlets where consumers look to purchase these products and expanding our sales to markets other than retail  particularly to oem customers 
we face other challenges as well 
flash card formats continue to change and to miniaturize 
we are focused on trying to ensure that we have the rights to manufacture and sell all flash card formats  that we have the engineering resources to design controllers for all media formats and design advanced features into our products and that we have partners with manufacturing capabilities that allow us to produce the newest and most advanced flash card formats and high capacity cards 
we also believe that a number of companies are selling flash products that infringe our intellectual property  and we are focused on protecting our intellectual property through litigation or negotiations 
we believe that meeting such challenges will be necessary to remain competitive in our markets 
revenues 
we generate revenues primarily from the sale of digital media and connectivity products to end users through mass market  photo and oem channels 
since the beginning of  we significantly increased our presence in the mass market channel by increasing the number of retail storefronts in which our customers sell our products 
our products were sold in more than  retail stores worldwide at the end of  which represents an increase of approximately  storefronts from the end of and an increase of approximately  storefronts from the end of as is common practice in the mass market channel  we offer our customers various programs and incentive offerings  including price protection  market development funds and cooperative marketing programs  rebates and other discounts 
digital media sales comprised of our gross revenues for 
table of contents we also generate revenues from the sales of our flash memory controllers and from license and royalty revenues under license agreements  which revenues have primarily been from samsung 
in april  we entered into a license agreement with samsung electronics co  ltd 
payments under the license agreement from samsung were fixed through march  after march   under the agreement  any license payments from samsung became variable based 
variable based royalties from samsung depend on factors such as which flash products samsung manufactures and sells and in what volumes  as well as our relative market share and our aggregate purchases from samsung 
since march   variable based royalties from samsung under this agreement have been minimal  and we expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
license and royalty revenues from all licensees were approximately million during we are actively working to license our technology to other companies  including companies that we believe infringe our patents 
a majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers 
our top customers accounted for of our gross revenues in  in  and in we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next several years 
product sales in north america have historically accounted for the majority of our total net product revenues 
net product revenues in north america represented approximately  and of our total net product revenues in  and  respectively 
over the long term  we expect our sales outside of north america will continue to increase as a percentage of our total net product revenues 
such revenue growth  however  may not be consistent between periods  for example  our product sales outside of north america as a percentage of our total net product revenues were approximately in the first quarter of and in the fourth quarter of net product revenues in europe represented  and of our total net product revenues in  and  respectively 
net product revenues in japan and the rest of the world represented  and of our total net product revenues in  and  respectively 
the markets we serve with our digital film  jumpdrive and mp products have been expanding rapidly 
this has increased the pressure on our ability to ensure an adequate supply of components and the scalability of our operations to meet surges in product demand such as we experienced in the fiscal fourth quarter of when product revenues grew sequentially over the third quarter of on a continuing basis  we must forecast our customer s product mix and volume accurately to ensure that we can meet their demands 
if we are unable to forecast our customer s product mix and volume accurately it may affect our ability to grow our revenues as projected and could result in product obsolescence or inventory write downs  which would harm our operating results 
in the second quarter of  we entered into an exclusive  multi year agreement with eastman kodak whereby we offer digital media for sale to customers under the kodak brand name on a worldwide basis 
we began introducing such products in the third quarter of kodak branded products increased as a percentage of our revenues during the third and fourth quarter of kodak branded products were less than ten percent of our sales in the fourth quarter 
we expect kodak branded products to continue to increase as a percentage of revenues during cost of product revenues 
our cost of product revenues consists primarily of materials costs  with flash memory accounting for a majority of the costs for both the products we manufacture and the products we purchase 
we maintain relationships with key suppliers and  in particular  we have supply agreements with both samsung and umc 
in april  we entered into a supply agreement with samsung 
under the supply agreement  we purchase the majority of our flash memory from samsung  which is priced based upon an agreed methodology 
samsung has guaranteed a certain allocation of flash memory production capacity to us 
in addition  samsung also has the right to purchase our flash memory controllers 
under the agreement  samsung provides us with intellectual property indemnification for the products we purchase from samsung  as well as industry standard warranties 
the supply agreement runs through march  unless the agreement is 
table of contents extended 
under our supply agreement with umc we purchase controllers at pricing based upon the timing and volume of purchases 
the purchase commitment for such controllers is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon based on a rolling forecast of our anticipated purchase orders  and such forecasts may only be changed by a certain percentage each month 
the agreement expires on december  unless the agreement is extended 
our industry has historically experienced average annual price reductions of flash memory per megabyte in the range of to 
the cost of flash memory declined moderately in and in the first half of in the second half of and the first quarter of  prices of flash memory remained stable or increased as industry wide demand for flash memory outpaced the supply of flash memory  which resulted in a general industry wide shortage 
in the latter half of  prices of flash memory declined as supply exceeded demand in certain densities and in anticipation of additional supply of flash memory 
we expect supply to remain tight in at least the first half of and  as a result  we expect prices of flash memory components in the first half of to generally remain stable or to decrease slightly in certain densities 
price reductions of flash memory from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of on a cost per megabyte basis were approximately 
a number of companies  including hynix  infineon  micron and st micro  have either entered the market in or have announced that they plan to do so in the first half of in addition  other companies  including renesas  samsung and toshiba  have announced that they plan to expand their production of flash memory during if these companies successfully introduce new products and or expand output of flash memory  it could create an over supply situation in the second half of  driving product prices down and lowering our cost of flash 
however  most of the new flash supply is lower density chips that can only be used cost effectively to manufacture lower capacity cards 
we expect that samsung and toshiba will dominate the market for high density flash chips for at least the next twelve months as new flash memory suppliers generally expect to begin their production with lower density products or do not bring significant supply of larger capacity flash to market over the period 
also  because of irregular component shipments from certain of our suppliers  we have had to carry a higher level of inventory as a buffer against delivery delays 
cost of product revenues also includes expenses related to materials procurement  inventory management  other overhead expenses and adjustments 
research and development 
our research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for research and development personnel  fees for outside consultants  patent development and registration costs and prototype development and materials costs 
the technology in our industry is evolving as flash cards  usb flash drives and mp players become smaller in size  perform at faster speeds  have increased storage capacity and require development of new hardware and software applications to meet the demands of the target markets we serve 
in addition  as new suppliers of flash memory enter the market  we will continue to evaluate their flash memory and make modifications to our controller technology as necessary to be able to utilize different types of flash memory technology in our products 
the number of digital media formats continues to increase  and we need to develop and manufacture controllers for each significant digital media format 
as a result of these and other developments  we believe that continued investment in research and development is important to enable us to attain our strategic objectives and we therefore expect research and development expenses to increase during the next twelve months 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses include freight and fulfillment  market development expenses  salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  advertising  customer service  technical support  distribution and travel and trade shows  and allowances for bad debt 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to vary during the next twelve months primarily in conjunction with changes in sales volumes throughout the year 
in addition  although we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues during  we expect to increase our expenses related to the sales of kodak branded memory cards worldwide 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for executive  administrative and operational personnel  fees for professional services and other 
table of contents corporate expenses 
during  we increased our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights and license our technology to those companies that we believe infringe our intellectual property 
legal expenses for have increased substantially over levels as our legal actions against toshiba moved toward trial and we became involved in additional litigation  including securities and product class action litigation 
in addition to our current litigation  a number of companies have brought products to market that we believe may infringe our intellectual property 
our legal expenses will increase substantially in the first quarter of due to the trial against toshiba 
if another of our legal actions were to proceed to trial  or if we become involved in additional litigation  our legal expenses could significantly increase beyond current levels 
in addition to increased costs associated with our litigation  we also believe that our general and administrative expenses will likely continue to remain significant in primarily as a result of costs associated with regulatory requirements related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of subsequent events on february   we entered into a three year asset based revolving credit facility arranged and agented by wells fargo foothill 
the maximum loan commitment is million  with the actual amount available for borrowing depending upon the value of our north american accounts receivable base 
on february   we borrowed approximately million under the wells fargo foothill facility 
at february   the annual interest rate for borrowings under the facility was percent determined using the bank s prime rate 
the maximum amount available to us under this facility on march  was million 
on march   we obtained a waiver from the lenders relating to the material weaknesses described in item a of this report and permitting us to issue the senior convertible notes described below 
on march   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due april  in a private offering 
we have granted the purchasers of the notes a day option to acquire an additional million in aggregate principal amount of notes 
the initial conversion price of the notes is per share 
see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the credit facility and the notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to price protection  customer programs and incentives  product returns  doubtful accounts  inventory valuation reserves  investments  intangible assets  income taxes and related valuation allowances  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
these estimates and assumptions may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  we are periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in this report in the section entitled risks that could affect future results 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  including price protection  rebates and other customer programs  and valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  including sales returns and other allowances  inventory valuation reserves  the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
revenue recognition product revenues we derive our revenues primarily from sales of our digital media products  which include flash memory devices  controllers and connectivity products 
we sell our products to oems  end users  distributors and retailers 
as discussed below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
with respect to sales to oems and end users we generally recognize product revenue upon delivery when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
with respect to sales to distributors and retailers we generally recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
many of our distributors and retailers collectively referred to herein as resellers have return rights 
for resellers where we are able to reasonably estimate the level of product returns and sales incentives  we recognize revenue upon shipment ship to basis and  at the time revenue is recorded  we record estimated reductions to product revenue based upon our customer sales incentive programs and the historical experience of product returns  and the impact of special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
in order to make such estimates  we analyze historical returns  current economic conditions  customer demand and other relevant specific customer information 
for resellers where we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of product returns or other revenue allowances  revenues and the costs of revenues are deferred sell through basis until these resellers have either sold the product to their customers or a time period that is reasonably estimated to allow these resellers to sell the product to their end customers has elapsed 
historically  for certain resellers we were able to reasonably estimate the level of product returns and sales incentives and  therefore  revenue with respect to such resellers was recognized on a ship to basis 
in prior public filings of our financial information  we noted that if  in the future  we were unable to reasonably estimate the level of product returns or other revenue allowances for these resellers  it could have a significant impact on our revenue recognition  potentially requiring us to defer the recognition of additional sales and recognize such sales on the sell through basis 
in such an event  we noted  in our prior public filings  that our recognized revenue could be adversely impacted in the period in which we implemented a transition to such a basis 
over the past several years  revenue related to all new resellers that have return rights or other revenue allowances were accounted for on a sell through basis 
starting in the fourth quarter of  we determined that due to the recent high volatility of prices in the retail market  we were no longer able to reasonably estimate the level of revenue allowances and product returns  and accordingly  we became unable to determine the selling price of our products at the time the sale took place 
as a result  effective october   for all of our resellers  revenues and the cost of revenues are deferred until these resellers have either sold the product to their customers or a time period that is reasonably estimated to allow these resellers to sell the product to their customers has elapsed 
the change in the timing of recognizing revenue related to all resellers now on a sell through basis  some of which were previously recognized on a sell to basis  had the initial one time effect of reducing net revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of by million  reducing gross margin by million and increasing net loss by million 
as of december  and december   deferred product margin from sales to resellers was million and million  respectively 

table of contents we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings  including price protection  promotions  co op advertising  and other volume based incentives and expected returns 
additionally  we have incentive programs or rebates that require us to estimate  based on historical experience  the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
marketing development programs are either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to marketing expense in compliance with the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force  or eitf  of the financial standards accounting board  or fasb  on issue license and royalty revenues when we have a signed license agreement  the technology has been delivered  there are no remaining significant obligations under the contract  the fee is fixed or determinable and non refundable and collectibility is reasonably assured  we recognize license fees and fixed non refundable royalties ratably over the term of the license or fixed royalty arrangement during which the customer has rights to the technology 
when royalties are based on the volume of products sold that incorporate our technology  revenue is recognized in the period licensed sales are reported to us 
we actively enforce our patented technologies and aggressively pursue third parties that are utilizing our intellectual property without a license or who have under reported the amount of royalties owed under license agreement with us 
as a result of such activities  from time to time  we may recognize royalty revenues that relate to infringements that occurred in prior periods 
these royalty revenues may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not occur in subsequent periods 
differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently determined as an adjustment to those amounts are recognized in the period such adjustment is determined as a change in accounting estimate 
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities valuation of inventory our inventories are stated in the lower of cost or market value 
cost includes materials  labor and other overhead costs 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods 
we primarily utilize estimated selling prices for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
any adjustment for market value provision is charged to cost of revenues 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales levels by product 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are provided for 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete based on several factors including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence 
changes to increase the inventory valuation reserve for lower of cost or market provision or excess and obsolete inventory provision are charged to cost of revenues 
at the point of this loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower costed inventory is subsequently sold  the related allowance is matched to the movement of related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
we operate in an industry that is characterized by intense competition  supply shortages or oversupply  rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs 

table of contents deferred tax valuation allowance as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes  which involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as deferred revenue 
these differences have resulted in a net deferred tax asset 
our judgment is required to assess the likelihood that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realizable 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax asset 
in the event management determines that it has become more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made  which would increase income and additional paid in capital in the period such determination is made 
as of december   we had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million of which is attributable to stock option plans  the benefit from which will be credited to additional paid in capital when recognized 
other valuation allowances and accrued liabilities we also maintain accruals and allowances for price protection  market development funds and cooperative marketing programs  rebates and other discounts 
we incurred sales related discounts of million  million  and million during  and  respectively 
at december  and  we had related accruals and allowances of million and million  respectively 
price protection  market development funds and cooperative marketing programs  rebates and other discounts are provided for at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
if market conditions were to change adversely  we may take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in increased accruals and allowances for these programs 
historically  warranty expenses have not been material 
in the event that a problem is identified that would result in the need to replace a product or products on a large scale  such an event will result in changes that would be recorded in the determination of net income loss in the period in which the additional cost is identified and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase in the allowance may be required 
results of operations in view of the rapidly changing nature of our market and our operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and other operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our historic revenue growth rates are not necessarily indicative of our future growth

table of contents of seasonality to our business 
for example  retail sales were very strong in both the fourth quarters of and due to seasonal consumer demand during the holidays

our license and royalty revenues decreased from million in to million in due to license and royalty revenues from samsung becoming variable in april as we have generated minimal variable based royalties under this agreement to date 
we will continue to seek new licensing opportunities in however  to the extent that we are unsuccessful in licensing our intellectual property or recovering license and royalty revenues from third parties who are infringing our patents or under reporting royalty revenues  our total license and royalty revenues will decline in we sell our controllers as a stand alone product to flash card manufacturers and license this technology to oems

we intend to incur significant expenses to fund operations to develop new products and to support existing product sales 
failure to generate sufficient revenues to offset the cost of revenues and other operating costs may require us to constrain our operations 

table of contents the following table is a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities the following table sets forth our days sales outstanding and inventory turns per year days sales outstanding net of change in deferred revenue inventory turns per year net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  included net increases in working capital of million  which were partially offset by non cash charges of million comprised primarily of million of depreciation and amortization  million of increases in allowance for sales returns  discounts and doubtful accounts and million of increase in inventory valuation reserve 
changes in working capital for the period included a million increase in inventory  a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the increase in our inventory was due primarily to the increased levels of inventory required to satisfy demand for our products and the increase in consigned inventory balances of million at december  compared to december  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased shipments of our products during and the increase in our days sales outstanding from days during to days in due to providing certain significant customers with day payment terms during the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to deferred freight and fulfillment costs  increased value added tax receivables and increased prepayments made for inventory purchases and the increased balance of value added tax prepayments due to increased shipments to our european and japanese subsidiaries 
these changes in working capital were offset by a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in accrued liabilities and a million increase in deferred license revenue and product margin 
the increase in accounts payable was due primarily to significantly increased inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the increase in accrued liabilities was due primarily to the increase in provisions for market development funds of million  legal fees of million  rebates of million and freight and fulfillment costs of million 
the increases in these provisions were primarily the result of increased gross product revenues during compared to the increase in deferred license revenue and product margin was primarily due to recording revenue from all of our retail customers on a sell through basis beginning in the fourth quarter of  compared to when revenue for certain of our retail customers was recorded on a sell to basis as discussed in this report under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue recognition 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  included net increases in working capital of million  which were partially offset by non cash charges of million 
changes in working capital for the period included a million increase in inventory  a million increase in accounts receivable  a million decrease in deferred license revenue and product margin and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the increase in our inventory was due primarily to the increased levels of inventory required to satisfy demand for our products and the increase in consigned inventory balances of million at december  compared to december  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased shipments of our products during and partially offset by an improvement in our days sales outstanding 
the decrease in deferred license revenue and product margin was primarily due to amortization of deferred license revenue related to our samsung  sony and olympus license agreements 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to increased prepayments made for inventory 
table of contents purchases and the increased balance of value added tax prepayments due to increased shipments to our european and japanese subsidiaries 
these changes in working capital were offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in accrued liabilities 
the increase in accounts payable was due primarily to increased inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the increase in accrued liabilities was due primarily to the increase in provisions for market development funds of million  price protection of million and rebates of million 
the increases in these provisions were primarily the result of increased gross product revenues during compared to net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was the result of purchases of short term investments of million  which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of short term investments of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and was the result of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of drawing million under our credit facility with wells fargo as described below and net proceeds of million from stock option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase program 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of raising million of net proceeds in september through the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a public offering and million from net proceeds from stock option exercises  sales under our employee stock purchase program and reduction of notes receivable from stockholders 
these sources of cash were partially offset by million from the repayment of notes payable under our credit facility with greater bay bank

restricted cash represents cash and cash equivalents used to collateralize standby letters of credit related to purchasing agreements with our suppliers 
in april  we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank 
our credit agreement with wells fargo bank enabled us to borrow up to million under a revolving line of credit note  which we did on october  subsequently  on february   we entered into a three year asset based revolving credit facility arranged and agented by wells fargo foothill  with a maximum loan commitment of million 
the actual amount available for borrowing depends upon the value of our north american accounts receivable base 
on february   we borrowed approximately million under the wells fargo foothill facility 
the maximum amount available to us under this facility on march  was million 
at february   the annual interest rate for borrowings under the facility was percent determined using the bank s prime rate 
we used the proceeds to repay  in full  our credit agreement with wells fargo bank 
as a condition of our asset based facility with wells fargo foothill  we terminated our credit agreement with wells fargo bank 
pursuant to the credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  we must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants 
the affirmative covenants include a restriction on capital expenditures of up to million in any fiscal year and a requirement that we report losses before interest  tax and amortization  commonly referred to as ebitda  of a loss of not more than million for the three months ending march   a loss of not more than million for the six months ending june   a loss of not more than million for the nine months ending december   a loss of not more than million for the year ending december  and a loss of not more than the loss in the immediately preceding period for any trailing twelve month period thereafter 
the negative covenants include  among others  limitations on indebtedness  liens  distribution or disposal of assets  changes in the nature of our business  investments  mergers or consolidations with or into third parties  transactions with affiliates  and modifications to material agreements 

table of contents upon the occurrence of an event of default  our obligations under the credit facility may become immediately due and payable 
events of default include  among others  our failure to pay our obligations under the credit facility when due  our failure to comply with any covenant set forth in the credit agreement  the attachment or seizure of a material portion of our assets  an insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against us  we are restrained from conducting any material part of our business  any judgment in excess of  is filed against us and not released  discharged  bonded against or stayed pending an appeal within days  breach of any material warranty in the credit agreement  breach or termination of a material contract  or the acceleration of  or default in connection with  any indebtedness involving an aggregate amount of  or more 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due april  in a private offering 
as a result of this issuance  we received net proceeds of million 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock any time at the option of the holders of the notes at a price equal to approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which represents a premium over our closing price of on march  the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  and interest on the notes will be payable on march and september of each year  beginning on september the notes will be redeemable  in whole or in part  for cash at our option beginning on april  at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest  if any  up to but excluding the redemption date  provided  however  that lexar may only exercise such redemption right if its common stock has exceeded of the conversion price of the notes for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date upon which we deliver the notice of redemption 
upon redemption  we will be required to make a payment equal to the net present value of the remaining scheduled interest payments through april  see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional terms of the credit facility and the notes 
we currently believe that  including the proceeds from issuing the convertible notes on march   we have sufficient cash and availability under our asset based credit facility to meet our operating  capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in executing our business plan  achieving profitability or maintaining our existing customer base 
our cash needs are also dependent on the credit terms extended to us by our suppliers  particularly samsung which supplies the majority of flash memory  and if our suppliers do not provide us with credit terms that are appropriate to meet our needs  we may have to seek alternate suppliers or additional financing 
to the extent that we do not generate sufficient revenues and reduce the cost of revenues or reduce the cost of discretionary expenditures and  as a result  cash  short term investments and available credit is insufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements  additional cash may be needed to finance operating and investing needs 
however  depending on market conditions  any additional financing needed may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
purchase commitments we purchase the majority of our flash memory from samsung pursuant to a supply agreement that expires on march   unless the agreement is extended 
samsung has guaranteed a certain allocation of its flash memory production capacity to us 
under the supply agreement  our purchases are priced based on an agreed upon methodology and samsung provides us with intellectual property indemnification for the products we purchase from them 
either party can terminate the supply agreement in the event of the other party s breach of the agreement or bankruptcy 
we are not obligated to purchase minimum volumes of flash memory from samsung 
we also have a supply agreement with umc under which we purchase controllers 
the purchase commitment for such controllers is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon based on a rolling forecast of 
table of contents our anticipated purchase orders 
this agreement expires on december  unless the agreement is extended 
if we do not extend the agreement  we intend to continue to purchase controllers from umc on a purchase order basis 
we depend on third party subcontractors for assembly and testing of our digital media products 
we do not have long term agreements with these subcontractors 
instead  we procure services from these subcontractors on a per order basis 
the following table outlines our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period in thousands total amount committed less than year years years after years contractual obligations and commercial commitments operating leases unconditional purchase obligations standby letters of credit total contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the normal course of business  we place cancelable purchase orders with our vendors and suppliers 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and purchase obligations as described above 
indemnifications we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
typically these obligations arise in connection with sales contracts and license agreements under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against any losses incurred as a result of a claim by any third party with respect to our products 
we also typically agree to pay any costs incurred in defense of any such claim 
the terms of the indemnification obligations are generally perpetual from the effective date of the agreement 
in certain cases  there are limits and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims 
we cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments  if any  that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements 
to date  the amounts required to defend indemnification claims have been insignificant 
accordingly  we have not accrued any amounts for these indemnification obligations as of december  or we have agreements whereby our directors and officers are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum amount of future payment we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we did not record any liabilities for these agreements as of december  or warranties we provide warranties that range from one year for digital music players and the xd picture card to lifetime warranties for our professional products 
warranty costs are the costs to rework or scrap returned inventories 
our warranty costs have historically been minimal

in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of the provisions of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r  however  it believes the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on net income loss and net income loss per share 
the impact on our financial statements will be dependent on the transition method  the option pricing model used to compute fair value and the inputs to that model such as volatility and expected life

table of contents risks that could affect future results the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
risks related to our business we are substantially leveraged  which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business  to develop or enhance our products  expand our operations  respond to competitive pressures or obtain additional financing 
we have significant indebtedness 
on february   we borrowed approximately million under our asset based credit facility with wells fargo foothill 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due april  the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences  including  but not limited to  the following our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes may be limited  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest of our indebtedness  if we elect to pay any premium on the senior convertible notes with shares of our common stock or we are required to pay a make whole premium with our shares of common stock  our existing stockholders interest in us would be diluted  and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
our ability to pay interest and principal on our asset based credit facility and debt securities  to satisfy other debt obligations which may arise and to make planned expenditures will be dependent on our future operating performance  which could be affected by changes in economic conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our debt instruments could result in events of default under such instruments  which could permit acceleration of the debt under such instruments and in some cases acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions 
if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness  seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms  that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not be able to maintain our product development schedule  respond to competitive pressures or grow our business 
failure to obtain additional funds when required could also result in inadequate capital to operate our business in accordance with our plans and require us to cut back operations  which could result in a further decline in revenues  or to cease our operations 
historically  cash generated from operations have not been sufficient to fund our capital requirements 
if we need to raise additional funds during the next twelve months to fund potential growth or our operations  it could be difficult to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
we may try to obtain additional financing by issuing shares of common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt securities  or warrants or otherwise  which could dilute our existing stockholders 

table of contents we expect that toshiba and toshiba america electronics company  inc will appeal a jury s award to us of over million in damages  and an unfavorable outcome could lead to a decline in our stock price and have a negative impact on our ability to increase our licensing revenues 
in march  a jury found toshiba corporation and toshiba america electronic components  inc liable to us for breach of fiduciary duty and theft of trade secrets and awarded us over million in damages  including a punitive damage award for conduct by toshiba that the jury found to be oppressive  fraudulent or malicious 
toshiba has indicated that it intends to pursue vigorously an appeal of these rulings 
the outcome of any post trial motions or an appeal is inherently uncertain and could result in the damage award being reduced or eliminated or the case being remanded to the trial court for further proceedings 
an appeal could take a significant amount of time during which we would not be able to collect on the verdict 
during the time the case remains pending  we expect to incur substantial additional legal costs 
if toshiba prevailed on having the verdict set aside either by the trial court or through an appeal of this verdict  the damages awarded to us could be reduced or eliminated 
this could adversely affect our ability to secure additional licensing revenue either from toshiba or other potential licensees which would likely have a negative impact on the value of our stock 
we have a history of losses and may not be able to return to or sustain profitability 
we incurred net losses in each of the second  third and fourth quarters of  including a net loss of million in the fourth quarter of  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to return to or sustain profitability in future periods  and we will likely use cash for operations 
our ability to return to or sustain profitability depends on the rate of price decreases for our products  the cost of our components  particularly flash memory  the growth of the markets for digital cameras or other host devices that use digital storage media  the extent to which our products  particularly our higher margin products  are accepted by these markets  our ability to charge a premium for our higher performance products  the success of our products and our ability to adequately manage our inventory and control our operating expenses  particularly our litigation costs 
we also must continue to reduce the costs of producing and selling our flash media products by controlling our internal and channel inventory  securing the best available pricing for flash memory and components used in our digital media products and reducing our manufacturing costs 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing revenues from our higher margin products and controlling our operating expenses  we may not be able to return to or sustain profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis 
a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting could result in an inability to accurately report our financial results that could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
effective internal control over financial reporting is essential for us to produce reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial information or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting 
in connection with our management s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   management identified two control deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses 
as more fully described in item a of this report  as of december   our management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over revenue recognition with respect to certain customers primarily our resellers  including adequate consideration of our estimates regarding offsets to or discounts from revenue such as price protection and promotional activities  and the accounting for inventory valuation reserves 
these deficiencies resulted in audit adjustments that were recorded in our consolidated financial statements for the fourth quarter of as a result of the material weaknesses identified  we concluded that our internal 
table of contents control over financial reporting was not effective as of december   and pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our independent registered public accounting firm  issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  a failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  including a failure to implement corrective actions to address the control deficiencies identified above  could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 
this  in turn  could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
our operating results and gross margins have fluctuated in the past  may fluctuate significantly in the future and are difficult to predict 
if our future results are below the financial guidance provided by us or the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
our operating results and gross margins have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors related to our industry and the markets for our products 
we will have little or no control over many of these factors and any of these factors could cause our operating results and gross margins  and consequently the price of our common stock  to fluctuate significantly 
these factors include  among others increases in the price of flash memory that we buy or the failure of cost decreases to keep up with price decreases for our products  the decision of our customers to return products or rotate their stock  the amount of price protection  volume incentive rebates  discounts  market development funds  cooperative advertising payments and other concessions and discounts that we may need to provide to some of our customers due to competitive pricing pressures  fluctuation in demand for our products  including seasonal demand for our products and the volume and timing of potential retail customer and distributor orders  competitive pricing pressures for the products we sell  the rate of growth of the market for digital cameras  digital media  cell phones with card slots and usb flash drives  the timely availability of flash memory  particularly flash memory that meets our technological requirements  the availability of sufficient silicon wafer foundry capacity and product components to meet customer demand  the difficulty of forecasting sell through rates of our products and their impact on inventory levels at our distributors and customers if sell through data is not timely reported to us  which may result in additional orders being delayed or reduced and inventory being returned  the timing and amount of expenses related to obsolescence and disposal of excess inventory and the difficulty of forecasting and managing our inventory levels  including inventories on consignment  the timing and amount of any reductions in the average selling prices of our products and services  the mix of business between retail  oem and licensing  price reductions in key components  such as flash memory  could result in reduced margins when selling products that include previously purchased components held in inventory  increases in costs charged by our component or card suppliers or the failure of our suppliers to decrease the prices they charge to us when industry prices decline  
table of contents the timing and amount of orders  cancellations from existing and new customers and penalties imposed by customers for failure to meet their requirements  the commencement of  involvement in or the expansion  appeal or settlement of our litigation  any changes in the trend of declining average selling prices per unit sold of digital storage media  competing flash card standards  which displace the standards used in our products  shortages of components such as capacitors and printed circuit boards required for the manufacturing of our products  exchange rate fluctuations  particularly the us dollar to british pound and japanese yen and the british pound to euro exchange rates  the announcement or introduction of products and technologies by competitors  the inability of new nand flash memory suppliers to fully indemnify us should we be subjected to litigation  potential product quality problems which could raise return or rework costs  and whether we can sell controllers in the volumes and at the prices we anticipate 
in addition  as a result of the emerging nature of our market  we may be unable to accurately forecast our revenues and gross margins 
we incur expenses based predominantly on operating plans and estimates of future revenues 
our expenses are to a large extent fixed in the short term and we may not be able to adjust them quickly to meet a shortfall in revenues during any particular quarter 
we also plan inventory levels based on anticipated demand for our products and on anticipated product mix 
as we anticipate increased demand for certain products we increase our level of inventory  which results in increased risk if we inaccurately estimate anticipated demand 
also  because of irregular component shipments from certain of our suppliers  we have had to carry a higher level of inventory as a buffer against delivery delays 
any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses and planned inventories would decrease our net income or increase our operating losses and harm our financial condition 
declines in our operating results or gross margins may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  which would be likely to cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we primarily depend upon samsung for our flash memory 
if samsung is unable to provide us with sufficient quantities of flash memory when we need it at prices and sales terms that allow us to be competitive in the marketplace  if samsung is unable to remain technologically competitive  or if samsung were to reduce or eliminate our credit terms  we would not be able to manufacture and deliver digital media to our customers in accordance with their volume  price and schedule requirements which would have a serious negative impact on our revenues and margins 
as a result of the supply agreement we entered into with samsung in april  it is our primary supplier of flash memory  which is the primary cost of our digital media 
during much of  the demand for flash memory was substantially greater than the supply of flash memory due to the continuing demand for digital cameras  increased use of flash memory in cellular phones and other digital consumer products  and increasing demand for usb flash drives 
shortages of flash memory now continue and we expect that the demand for flash memory during will continue to be greater than the available supply 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of flash memory from samsung or from another flash memory supplier in a timely manner and at competitive prices  we will not be able to manufacture and deliver flash memory products to satisfy our customers requirements 
although a number of semiconductor companies have begun to manufacture flash memory that would meet some of our needs  samsung and toshiba continue to control virtually all of the market for flash memory for our products 
the new flash suppliers have been delayed in their efforts to enter the flash chip market and their technical roadmaps may now be substantially behind the products manufactured and sold 
table of contents by samsung and toshiba 
even as additional flash memory capacity becomes available from new suppliers  these suppliers may not be able to supply our flash memory needs at competitive prices if we cannot obtain adequate supplies from samsung 
even if we are able to obtain flash memory in sufficient volumes and on schedules that permit us to satisfy our delivery requirements  we cannot assure you that the prices charged by samsung or other suppliers will enable us to compete effectively in our market 
if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of our customers or supply digital media to them in the volumes they request  they will likely reduce future orders or eliminate us as a supplier 
our reputation would likely also be harmed and we may not be able to replace any lost business with new customers 
if we are unable to obtain flash memory at economical prices  our gross margins would decline unless we could raise the prices of our products in a commensurate manner or offset the cost increases elsewhere 
the existing competitive conditions in our industry may not permit us to do so  which would adversely impact our revenues and gross margins 
in addition  if samsung does not offer us prices  sales terms and credit terms that are appropriate to meet our growing needs  we might have to seek alternate suppliers or additional financing 
furthermore  if samsung is unable to increase its output of flash memory in a manner commensurate with our needs  or to manufacture flash memory that is technologically and price competitive  or if it has any interruptions in shipment for any reason  we would be unable to satisfy our customers requirements 
for example  samsung has previously emphasized smaller flash geometries over multi level cell technology 
in contrast  toshiba and sandisk appear to be manufacturing multi level cell technology in volume at high yields  which appears to give them significant cost advantages over single level cell technologies 
if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of our customers  they may reduce any future orders or eliminate us as a supplier 
our reputation would likely also be harmed and we may not be able to replace any lost business with new customers 
samsung has from time to time considered directly entering the retail market for flash media  which would make it a direct competitor to us 
samsung and other current and potential suppliers of flash memory are located in asia  a region that has been  and in the future may be  affected by economic and political instability that could adversely affect the price and supply of flash memory 
our agreements with samsung terminate in march unless extended 
either party can terminate the agreement in the event of the other party s breach of the agreement or bankruptcy 
the solid state storage market is evolving and we may not have rights to manufacture and sell certain types of flash card formats or we may be forced to pay a royalty to sell digital media in these formats 
future digital media formats may not use our core technology 
many new digital cameras and other consumer devices now use digital media formats such as the secure digital card or xd picture card formats  which we do not have the rights to manufacture 
our cost structure on these products is higher than our cost structure for other products 
the secure digital card was introduced by a consortium consisting of sandisk  matsushita and toshiba 
the consortium charges significant license fees to other companies that want to manufacture sd cards 
the secure digital card and the xd picture card have rapidly gained broad consumer acceptance 
this has resulted  and will likely continue to result in a decline in demand  on a relative basis  for products that we have the rights to manufacture without the payment of a royalty 
in  products we purchase and resell significantly increased as a percentage of our total net revenues 
we believe that one of our advantages is our ability to offer retailers all major flash card formats  and if we were unable to supply all flash card formats at competitive prices or if we were to have product shortages  our margins would be adversely impacted and our customers would likely cancel orders or seek other suppliers to replace us 
we have recently modified our pricing strategy and have significantly reduced promotional programs and increased prices on certain products to most of our customers to better align our selling prices with our cost structure 
many of our retail customers and distributors have rights of return and we may be required to take 
table of contents back large quantities of unsold customer inventory if as a result of our recent actions or otherwise they decide to terminate their relationship with us and purchase from other vendors 
substantially all of our sales of our digital media products to end users are made through distributors and retailers 
our sales through these channels often include rights to return unsold customer inventory still in the customers inventory for credit 
we have recently modified our pricing strategy and have significantly reduced promotional programs and increased prices on certain products to most of our customers to better align our selling prices with our cost structure 
our resellers or their customers may not accept these price increases and may decide to reduce their orders  purchase from other vendors or return unsold product to us 
in the past several months  we have lost product placements to our competitors at wal mart  compusa and other resellers in part because of our pricing strategy 
at wal mart in particular  which accounted for more than of our gross revenue in  we may experience a significant decline in sales due to the addition of other vendors 
if our resellers reduce or cancel their orders  they may also decide to exercise their rights of return and require that we take back large quantities of unsold customer inventory 
our customers generally place orders on the expectation of certain promotional support from us  and as we reduce our promotional activities  those customers may decide to return significant amounts of products to us 
if there are significant inventories of old products in our distribution channel when a new product is released  or if these distributors and retailers are unsuccessful in selling our products  there could be substantial product returns 
if our reserves are insufficient to account for these returns or if we are unable to resell these products on a timely basis at similar prices  our revenues may be reduced 
because the market for our products is rapidly evolving  we may not be able to resell returned products at attractive prices or at all 
if we are unable to generate increased revenue from licensing our intellectual property  our gross margins and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
we have historically derived the substantial majority of our licensing revenue from a limited number of sources 
if we fail to generate significant licensing revenues or increase the revenues we derive from our higher margin controller sales  we may not grow our revenues and margins as planned 
in march  we executed a license agreement with samsung that provided for fixed license payments through march  and variable based royalties thereafter 
whether we will be paid any royalties under the variable based royalty obligations depends on many factors  including which flash products samsung manufactures and sells and in what volumes  as well as our relative market share and our aggregate purchases from samsung 
since march   variable based royalties from samsung under this agreement have been minimal and we expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to secure new license or royalty revenues  and our failure to do so could negatively impact our operating results 
our unit volume has increased substantially in recent periods and has strained our operations infrastructure and our supply chain 
the number of units we manufacture on a weekly basis has increased significantly and has strained our supply chain and operational capabilities 
our contract manufacturers may not be able to manufacture product at levels necessary to sustain our increased growth 
our component suppliers may not be able to keep up with the growth in our need for parts 
our other vendors  such as those that package our products  also may have trouble meeting our additional demands on them 
if we are not able to continue to accommodate this increased unit demand from our customers  we may have product shortages 
if we were to have product shortages  our customers would likely cancel orders  impose penalties for late shipment or delivery cancellations  require that we use faster shipping methods which would increase our freight and fulfillment expenses or seek other suppliers to replace us 
if our component suppliers are not able to meet our demand in a timely manner  we may not be able to manufacture and package products quickly enough to meet customer demand 
if this were to occur  customers 
table of contents would likely cancel orders or switch suppliers 
in addition if we are unable to manufacture products at rates sufficient to keep up with our component purchases  we may have too much inventory that would later need to be written down if component prices decrease 
this challenge can be  and has in the past been  particularly acute during the fourth quarter when demand for components is high and retail customers require the delivery of large volumes of products during a narrow window of time 
in addition  because the first quarter typically experiences lower demand than the fourth quarter  inventory planning becomes particularly important 
if we are not able to manage our component purchases and inventory appropriately  our financial results will be negatively impacted 
in addition  we must continue to make significant investments in our existing internal information management systems to support increased manufacturing  as well as accounting and other management related functions 
our systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support rapid growth  and as described in further detail in item a of this report  we have identified two deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that were determined to be material weaknesses 
we cannot assure you that we will not have internal control deficiencies in the future  including deficiencies that may be deemed to be material weaknesses  which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the improvement in economic conditions will likely extend the lead time for procuring components 
if we do not plan properly or if the demand rises too quickly  we will face material shortages 
we market our digital media primarily on the basis of its superior technology 
if we are unable to achieve or maintain technological leadership  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline significantly 
we market our digital media primarily on the basis of its performance and technology advantage over our competitors products 
in doing so  we have emphasized our speed and other advantages over our competitors products and have tried to establish ourselves as the brand of choice among professional photographers 
we label our compactflash and some of our jumpdrive and secure digital card products as capable of sustained write speed performance in which x is equal to a write speed of kilobytes per second  nomenclature similar to that used in the cd rom industry 
for example  our x compactflash digital film is capable of sustained write speeds of at least kilobytes per second 
currently  we offer compactflash  secure digital and jumpdrive flash drives capable of minimum sustained write speeds up to x  x and x  respectively 
our highest capacity card is currently eight gigabytes 
from time to time our competitors have introduced products for which they have claimed high  sustained write speeds  including write speeds faster than that of some of our own competing products 
if we are unable to design and manufacture products that are technologically superior to those of our competitors or if we lose our status as a brand preferred by professional photographers  we will be unable to achieve a premium price for our products 
if this were to occur  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline significantly 
increased competition in the digital media market may lead to a decrease in our revenues and market share 
our industry is characterized by intense competition  supply shortages or oversupply  rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
our existing competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have longer operating histories and have or may have greater brand name recognition  greater access to flash memory  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with retailers  oems and end users 
as a result  these competitors may be able to better absorb price declines  ensure more stable supply  adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we may 
ultimately  this may lead to a decrease in our sales and market share 
we compete with semiconductor companies that manufacture and sell flash memory chips or flash memory cards 
these include hynix  infineon  micron  renesas  samsung  sandisk  st micro and toshiba 
sandisk and toshiba jointly develop and manufacture both low cost and high performance flash memory through their flash vision joint venture 
because flash memory represents a significant portion of the cost of flash media  sandisk 
table of contents and other flash manufacturers may have a competitive advantage and may have access to flash memory at prices substantially below the prices that our suppliers charge to us 
sandisk has other competitive advantages in that it also collects substantial royalties pursuant to license agreements with samsung and others 
sandisk also collects royalties on the manufacture and sale of sd cards 
in conjunction with the sandisk samsung license agreement  sandisk has announced that samsung sells flash to sandisk at very favorable pricing 
we also face significant competition from manufacturers or card assemblers and resellers that either resell flash cards purchased from others or assemble cards from controllers and flash memory chips purchased from companies such as renesas  samsung or toshiba  into flash cards 
these companies include crucial  dane elec  delkin devices  kodak  feiya  fuji  hagiwara  hewlett packard  data i o  infineon  kingston  m systems  matsushita  memorex  memory plus  micron  pny  pqi  pretec  ritek  samsung  sandisk  silicon storage technology  simpletech  smart modular technologies  sony  tdk  transcend  viking interworks and many others 
in addition  an increasing number of companies are manufacturing their own controllers  including genesys  hyperstone  prolific  sandisk  sigmatel  silicon storage technology  smi  solid state system  sony and zoran 
such companies either combine their controller with flash memory from third parties to manufacture their own flash cards or sell their controllers to third parties who use them to assemble flash cards 
additionally  major semiconductor companies such as infineon  micron  renesas  samsung and toshiba have also developed or are currently developing their own controllers that will likely compete with our controller and or card sales 
furthermore  many companies have introduced usb flash drives that compete directly with our jumpdrive line of products 
these include apacer  belkin  fuji  iomega  jmtek  kti networks  m systems  netac  pny  samsung  sandisk  simpletech  sony  trek and many others 
many of our competitors are larger than we are and  because they manufacture their own controllers and flash memory  do not depend to the extent we do on third parties to supply them with those products 
flash memory has been in short supply for a number of quarters which has resulted in our flash costs decreasing at a slower rate than product pricing in the market 
companies that manufacture their own flash memory will have a significant advantage so long as this allocation situation continues 
our competitors have also introduced certain flash card formats 
for example  a consortium consisting of sandisk  matsushita and toshiba have developed the secure digital card  a media format used in digital cameras as well as in other electronic applications  and fuji and olympus introduced the xd picture card 
although we currently sell these flash memory products  which we source from third parties  we must pay significant royalties or higher costs to do so and may not be able to do so in the future at a reasonable rate or at all 
in addition  sandisk has introduced transflash which is designed to be used in cell phone applications 
if we are unable to obtain the rights to manufacture these products  our business will be adversely affected 
we also face competition from some manufacturers of traditional film products 
kodak and fuji are the largest and best known manufacturers of traditional film products 
fuji has entered the flash card market  but does not yet manufacture its own flash cards 
last year  we entered into an agreement with kodak to sell flash cards under the kodak brand on a worldwide basis 
with their resources and worldwide brand recognition  fuji and kodak  if we were to lose the rights to sell products under that brand  would be formidable competitors for our core business 
several companies  such as cornice  ibm  and matrix semiconductor have introduced competing technologies for use in digital cameras 
these include products such as digital capture technology and the microdrive 
although the cost per megabyte of rotating media such as digital capture technology and the microdrive is lower than that of flash cards  rotating media has historically had higher power consumption and lower reliability than flash cards 
compact discs can also be used as a storage medium for digital cameras and other devices  and  while inexpensive  are quite bulky 
we expect to continue to face competition from existing 
table of contents or future competitors that design and market similar or alternative data storage solutions that may be less costly or provide additional features 
if a manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer electronic devices designs one of these alternative competing standards into its products  the digital media we manufacture  as currently configured  will not be compatible with that product and our revenues may decline 
if we are unable to continue to develop  competitively market and sell our jumpdrive portable flash storage product line  our revenues and gross margins and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues and gross margin from sales of our jumpdrive flash storage products 
the market for usb drives has become increasingly competitive 
we believe that design has become an important selling feature for these products unlike other flash cards which have fixed dimensions and specifications 
if we cannot continue to develop  market and sell these products  particularly with designs that appeal to a broad group of customers  our revenues  gross margins and profits may decline 
if we are unable to develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new products or services that are accepted by our customers and consumers  we will not be able to compete effectively in our market 
we operate in an industry that is subject to evolving industry standards  rapid technological changes  rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new  higher performance products that shorten product life cycles and tend to decrease average selling prices 
to remain competitive in this demanding market  we must continually design  develop and introduce new products and services that meet the performance and price requirements of our customers and consumers 
for example  as the number of flash card formats proliferates  it puts significant additional strain on our engineering group to design controllers for each format 
any significant delay or failure in releasing new products or services would harm our reputation  provide a competitor a first to market opportunity or allow a competitor to achieve greater market share 
also  we cannot assure you that any products or services we do introduce will gain market acceptance 
the introduction of new products is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee advances in technology and the adoption of new standards  to coordinate our technical personnel and strategic relationships and to identify and eliminate design and product flaws 
we may not be able to recoup research and development expenditures if our new products or services are not widely accepted 
our products are characterized by average selling prices that have historically declined over relatively short time periods 
if we are unable to effectively manage our inventories  reduce our costs  introduce new products with higher average selling prices or increase our sales volumes  our revenues and gross margins will be negatively impacted 
our competitors and customers impose significant pricing pressures on us 
at times  these pricing pressures have been possible as a result of lower flash memory costs 
at other times  such as in the fourth quarter of  our prices have fallen faster than our costs which has resulted in additional margin pressure 
in addition  because a large percentage of our sales are to a small number of customers that are primarily retail consumer chains  distributors and large oems  these customers have exerted  and we expect they will continue to exert  pressure on us to make price concessions 
in the past  we have significantly reduced the prices of many of our flash products from time to time  and we may need to continue to do so to remain competitive even though we are currently asking many of our customers to accept price increases 
any reduction in prices by us will hurt our gross margins unless we can manage our internal and channel inventories and our cost structure to minimize the impact of such price declines and reduce our costs 
we also sell our products to certain customers on a consignment basis  which has resulted in us carrying higher inventory levels 
if we are unable to reduce our costs to offset declines in average selling prices or increase the sales volume of our existing products  our revenues and gross margins will be adversely affected 
we anticipate that our average selling prices will continue to decline in this may negatively impact our anticipated growth in product revenues as well as our gross margins  particularly if the decline in our average selling prices is not 
table of contents matched by price declines in our component costs  primarily the cost of flash memory 
furthermore  even if we experience price declines in our component costs  such price reductions could result in reduced margins when we sell products that include components in inventory which were previously purchased at a higher price 
because we protect many of our retail customers and distributors against the effects of price decreases on their inventories of our products  we have in the past and may in the future incur large price protection charges if we reduce our prices when there are large quantities of our products in our distribution channel 
nearly all of our retail product sales in  and were made through our resellers to which we have provided price protection 
price protection allows customers to receive a price adjustment on existing inventory when its published price is reduced 
in an environment of slower demand and abundant supply of products  price declines and channel promotions expenses are more likely to occur and  should they occur  are more likely to have a significant impact on our operating results 
further  in this environment  high channel inventory may result in substantial price protection charges 
these price protection charges have the effect of reducing gross sales and gross margin 
price protection in our retail channel during  was approximately million  or of product revenues  and in  we incurred price protection of approximately million  or of product revenues 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur price protection charges for the foreseeable future due to competitive pricing pressures 
if our price protection reserves are insufficient or we continue to have difficulties estimating future charges  our revenues and gross margins would be adversely affected in future periods 
our strategic partnership with kodak and our ongoing relationships with oem customers pose significant challenges for us  and if we are unable to manage these relationships  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
we have entered into an exclusive multi year agreement with kodak under which we will manufacture and distribute a full range of kodak branded memory cards 
this transition to the kodak business could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins if we are  among other things  unable to properly manage the distribution and use of the kodak brand  control the sales and marketing expenses associated with launching the brand in new channels  plan for anticipated changes in demand  effectively leverage the kodak brand to achieve premium pricing and grow market share  maintain the market share position of the lexar brand  and appropriately allocate resources to support a dual branding strategy 
in the future  a significant portion of our revenue may be derived from sales of digital media under the kodak brand 
we have a number of obligations that we must fulfill under our agreement with kodak to keep the license exclusive and to keep it in effect 
these obligations include compliance with kodak guidelines and trademark usage  customer satisfaction  and a number of market share goals and target minimum royalty payments 
if we were to lose the rights to sell products under the kodak brand  our financial results could be significantly negatively impacted 
in addition  our business may also be negatively impacted if we are unable to manage our existing relationships with our oem customers 
our oem customers include many large domestic and international companies that have greater financial resources and bargaining power than we do 
as a result  our agreements with some of these customers include restrictions and commitments that could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 
these contractual provisions include  among others guaranteed pricing and price protection  commitments to supply product at the customer s requested volumes  penalties for late shipment  delivery cancellation or failure to meet certain quality assurances  agreements not to sue  or assert our intellectual property rights against  such customers  and limitations on our ability to terminate such agreements 

table of contents we may need to write down our inventory if our sales levels do not match our expectations or if pricing declines more than we anticipate  which could adversely impact our revenues and gross margins 
we operate in an industry that is characterized by intense competition  supply shortages or oversupply  rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence  all of which make it more challenging to effectively manage our inventory 
our inventories are stated in the lower of cost or market value 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including judgments regarding average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods 
we primarily utilize estimated selling prices for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
when market value is determined to be below cost  we make appropriate allowances to reduce the value of inventories to net realizable value 
this may occur where we determine that inventories are slow moving  obsolete or excess or where the selling price of the product is insufficient to cover product costs and selling expenses 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs and our revenues and gross margins will be negatively impacted 
we depend on a few key customers and the loss of any of them could significantly reduce our revenues 
historically  a small number of our customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
during  sales to the ten customers from which we received the greatest revenues accounted for approximately of our total gross revenues 
sales to one customer  wal mart  represented greater than of our gross revenues 
we have lost product placements to our competitor at wal mart and expect that it will be a smaller portion of our business in our revenues could decline if one or more of these customers were to significantly reduce  delay or cancel their orders  decide to purchase digital media manufactured by one of our competitors  develop and manufacture their own digital media or cease operations due to the downturn in the global economy or otherwise 
in addition  we do not carry credit insurance on our accounts receivables and any difficulty in collecting outstanding amounts due from our customers  particularly customers that place larger orders or experience financial difficulties  could adversely affect our revenues and our net income 
because our sales are made by means of standard purchase orders rather than long term contracts  we cannot assure you that these customers will continue to purchase quantities of our products at current levels  or at all 
furthermore  our revenues include sales to oems  some of which have elected  or may in the future decide  to compete against us in the digital media market 
we expect our operating results for at least the next several years to continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers 
if we are unable to develop or maintain the strategic relationships necessary to develop  sell and market products that are commercially viable and widely accepted  the growth and success of our business may be limited 
we may not be able to develop and sell products that are commercially viable and widely accepted if we are unable to anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of digital camera and flash memory manufacturers 
we must continue to collaborate closely with our customers  digital camera manufacturers  flash memory manufacturers and other suppliers to ensure that critical development  marketing and distribution projects proceed in a coordinated manner 
this collaboration is also important because our ability to anticipate trends and plan our development activities depends to a significant degree upon our continued access to information derived from strategic relationships we currently have with digital camera and flash memory manufacturers 
this collaboration can be difficult because many of these companies are located in europe or asia 
if any of our current relationships terminate or otherwise deteriorate  or if we are unable to enter into future alliances that provide us with comparable insight into market trends  we will be hindered in our product development efforts 

table of contents we rely to a significant degree on retailers to sell our digital media products 
we sell a significant percentage of our digital media products through retailers  most notably best buy  compusa  dixons group plc  office max  ritz camera centers  target and wal mart  rather than through oems 
sales to retailers subject us to many special risks  including the following continued downward pricing pressure in the retail channel has  and we expect will continue to  necessitate price protection of the inventories of our products that many of our customers carry  loss of market share if the retailers that carry our products do not grow as quickly and sell as many digital media products as the retailers that carry the digital media products of our competitors  loss of business or monetary penalties if we are unable to satisfy the product needs of these customers or fulfill their orders on a timely basis  increased sales and marketing expenses if we are unable to accurately forecast our customer s orders  including  among other items  increased freight and fulfillment costs if faster shipping methods are required to meet customer demand  product returns could increase as a result of our strategic interest in assisting retailers in balancing their inventories  reduced ability to forecast sales  reduced gross margins  delays in collecting receivables and increased inventory levels due to the increasing tendency for some retailers to require products on a consignment basis  and retailers may emphasize our competitors products over our products  or decline to carry our products 
availability of reliable sell through data varies throughout the retail channel  which makes it difficult for us to determine actual retail product revenues until after the end of each of our fiscal quarters 
unreliable sell through data may result in either an overstatement or understatement of our reported revenues and results of operations 
our arrangements with our customers also provide them price protection against declines in our recommended selling prices 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have exclusive relationships with our retailers or distributors and therefore must rely on them to effectively sell our products over those of our competitors 
because we depend on single suppliers for some key components and products and do not have long term supply contracts with those suppliers  we are exposed to the risks  including  price increases  late deliveries  poor component quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components in addition  not all of these suppliers provide us with indemnification for their products  so we also face the risk that our margins and operating results would be severely negatively impacted if such products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party or if we are found to owe license fees or royalties relating to these products 
we have a sole source of supply for certain components in our digital media 
because we depend on single suppliers for certain key components  and do not have a long term supply contract with any of these suppliers  we face the risk of inadequate component supply  price increases  late deliveries and poor component quality 
any supplier may terminate their relationships with us or pursue other relationships with our competitors  and if we were to lose our relationship with these single suppliers  the lead time required to qualify new suppliers could be as long as three months 
also  if we lose our single suppliers or these suppliers are otherwise unable to satisfy our volume and delivery schedule requirements  it may be difficult to locate any suppliers who have the ability to develop  manufacture and deliver the specialized components we need for our products 
if we are unable to accurately predict our supply needs  or if our supply of components is disrupted  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose existing customers  incur penalties imposed by existing customers or be unable to attract new customers 

table of contents we also do not currently manufacture certain digital media formats  such as the memory stick duo  memory stick pro  xd picture card  secure digital card or mini secure digital  with our own controllers 
until we are able to develop our own flash memory controller for these and other products  we must purchase such cards from third parties for resale 
we do not have long term supply contracts with all of these suppliers  and therefore face the risks of inadequate supply  price increases  late delivery or unavailability and the need to maintain buffer inventory 
if our supply of such products is disrupted  we will lose existing customers and may be unable to replace them or to attract new ones 
furthermore  not all of our suppliers provide us with indemnification regarding such sales 
other suppliers impose limits on their indemnification obligations 
if such products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party or if we are found to owe license fees or royalties relating to these products  our margins and operating results would be severely negatively impacted 
we depend primarily on united microelectronics corporation  or umc  to manufacture our controllers  and if we are unable to obtain from umc sufficient quantities of controllers at acceptable quality  yields and prices  and in a timely manner  we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products  which could limit the growth and success of our business 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility  or fab 
instead  we rely primarily on a foundry  umc  to produce the majority of our controller products 
our reliance on an independent foundry involves a number of significant risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and unavailability of  or delayed access to  next generation or key process technologies 
we have entered into a supply agreement with umc under which we are obligated to provide umc with a rolling forecast of our anticipated purchase orders 
such forecasts may only be changed by a certain percentage each month 
this limits our ability to react to significant fluctuations in demand for our products 
if umc were to become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our controllers in the required volumes  at acceptable quality  yields and prices  and in a timely manner  we might not be able to meet customer demand for our products  which could limit the growth and success of our business 
we have qualified other fabs  but we cannot assure you that they will have sufficient capacity to accommodate our demand at any particular time 
our contract with umc terminates in december in addition  if competition for foundry capacity increases  we may incur significant expenses to secure access to manufacturing services  which in turn may cause our product costs to increase substantially 
we expect that the demand for capacity at these facilities will change in the near future due to fluctuating demand for consumer electronic and industrial products that depend on semiconductors manufactured at these facilities 
all of these foundries are located in an area of the world that may be subject to political and economic instability  the sars epidemic and natural disasters  particularly earthquakes 
while the last major earthquake in taiwan did not have a significant impact on deliveries to us from umc  a similar event in the future at one of their foundries could have a significant impact 
we depend solely on third party subcontractors for assembly and testing of our digital media products  which could result in product shortages or delays or increase our costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products 
our flash cards are primarily assembled and tested by pc partner in china  power digital card in taiwan  venture manufacturing services in singapore and indonesia  and venture manufacturing  vitron  macrotron and pc partner in the united states 
we do not have a long term agreement with vitron  venture manufacturing or pc partner and typically obtain services from them on a per order basis 
additionally  our controllers are assembled  tested and packaged primarily by advanced semiconductor engineering in taiwan  advanced interconnection technologies in indonesia and in the united states 
our reliance on these subcontractors 
table of contents involves risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  inventory levels and costs 
these risks could result in product shortages or increase our costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products 
if these subcontractors are unable or unwilling to continue to provide assembly and test services and deliver products of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  we would have to identify and qualify other subcontractors 
this could be time consuming and difficult and result in unforeseen operations problems 
if our efforts to optimize our supply chain are unsuccessful and we are unable to meet our customers requirements  our business could be negatively impacted 
in order to improve our ability to operate within an increasingly competitive environment  we are taking a variety of measures designed to improve operational efficiency  including  among other items  streamlining our logistics to improve inventory management and reducing manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
one impact of these changes will be that we will carry less inventory as a buffer against irregular deliveries from our suppliers 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to achieve the foregoing  or  if the third party subcontractors and suppliers on whom we depend fail to deliver or manufacture products in a timely manner or are unable or unwilling to provide the products and services we obtain from them at the cost and quality we require  our supply of components may be adversely affected 
if this were to occur  we would not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner necessary to meet their requirements 
as a result  our business could be harmed  we may lose customers  and we may be unable to achieve our goal of returning to profitability 
our failure to successfully promote our brand and achieve strong brand recognition in target markets could limit or reduce the demand for our products and services 
we believe that brand recognition will be important to our ability to succeed as the digital photography and the digital media markets continue to develop 
we plan to continue to invest in marketing programs to create and maintain prominent brand awareness 
if we fail to promote our brand successfully  or if the expenses associated with doing so become increasingly high  our business may not grow as we anticipate 
other companies  who may have significantly more resources to promote their own brands than we do  may not be aggressively promoting their flash card brands 
if they begin to more aggressively promote their brand or if our products exhibit poor performance or other defects  our brand may be adversely affected  which would inhibit our ability to attract or retain customers 
if we encounter difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel  we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy  we may need to grant large stock based incentives that could be dilutive to our stockholders and we may be required to pay significant salaries which would increase our general and administrative costs 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees  including eric b 
stang  our chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer  and petro estakhri  our chief technology officer and executive vice president of engineering 
our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales  marketing  finance and managerial personnel 
if we are unable to find  hire and retain qualified individuals  we may have difficulty implementing portions of our business strategy in a timely manner  or at all 
we may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
to attract and retain qualified personnel  we may be required to grant large option or other stock based incentive awards  which may be highly dilutive to existing stockholders and  as a result of a recent accounting pronouncement issued by the fasb  would require us to record compensation expense related to such grants  which would result in lower reported earnings 
we may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses to attract and retain these individuals  which could harm our operating results 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  we will not be able to grow our business 

table of contents we are currently involved in stockholder litigation  and could be involved in additional litigation in the future  which could have a negative impact on our business  operating results  financial position and liquidity 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of its securities 
following just such a period of volatility in the market price of our securities  we were named along with our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as a defendant in federal class action litigation  based principally on allegations that we made misrepresentations regarding our business 
in addition  derivative litigation against certain of our officers and directors in which we are a nominal defendant  based on allegations substantially similar to those in the class action litigation  has been commenced in california state court 
the court has granted our motion to dismiss the plaintiff s complaint in the derivative action  but the federal class action continues to proceed 
although we are unable to predict the scope or outcome of that litigation  it and similar litigation in the future  if any  could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our operating results and our business 
in addition  the conduct of these proceedings could negatively impact our stock price  and an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and liquidity 
if our products contain defects  we may incur unexpected and significant operating expenses to correct the defects  we may be required to pay damages to third parties and our reputation may suffer serious harm 
although the digital media products that we manufacture are tested after they are assembled  these products are extremely complex and may contain defects 
these defects are particularly likely when new versions or enhancements are released 
the sale of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
for example  if there are defects in our products that cause loss of data  customers may lose their digital images stored on our digital media 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and management resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
products we source from others may have defects that we cannot quickly fix and that will require us to return them to the manufacturer  which could result in delayed product shipments and damage to our reputation 
our significant sales outside the united states subject us to increasing foreign political and economic risks  including foreign currency fluctuations  and it may be difficult for us to anticipate demand and pricing in those regions or effectively manage the distributor channels and relationships in those regions 
total net revenues outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our total net revenues for the year ended december  we generated a majority of our international revenues from product sales in europe and from product sales and licensing agreements in asia 
the european and asian markets are intensely competitive 
one of our principal growth strategies is to expand our presence in this and other international markets both through increased international sales and strategic relationships 
for example  we are expanding distribution of our products into latin america  china  india  malaysia  indonesia  the middle east  russia and eastern europe 
consequently  we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to international risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  political and economic instability  delays in meeting customer commitments due to difficulties associated with managing an international distribution system  increased time to collect receivables caused by slower payment practices that are common in many international markets  difficulties associated with managing export licenses  tariffs and other regulatory issues pertaining to international trade  
table of contents increased effort and costs associated with the protection of our intellectual property in foreign countries  natural disasters  political uncertainties and changing regulatory environments in foreign countries  and difficulties in hiring and managing employees in foreign countries 
in addition  if we are unable to accurately anticipate demand and pricing of products in international markets  or if we cannot work effectively with our distribution partners to create demand  develop effective marketing programs  manage inventory levels and collect receivables in a timely fashion  our operating results will be harmed and our stock price will likely decline 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could cause our products to become less competitive in international markets and could adversely affect our operating results 
although  the sales of our products are denominated primarily in united states dollars  we also have product sales denominated in british pounds  euros and other european currencies  as well as the japanese yen 
to the extent our prices are denominated in foreign currencies  particularly the british pound  the euro and japanese yen  we will be exposed to increased risks of currency fluctuations 
we have foreign subsidiaries in australia  great britain  japan  hong kong and shanghai that operate and sell our products in various global markets 
as a result  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates for our sales as well as our costs denominated in those currencies 
we use forward contracts  to manage the exposures associated with our net asset or liability positions 
however  we cannot assure you that any policies or techniques that we have implemented will be successful or that our business and financial condition will not be harmed by exchange rate fluctuations 
if our suppliers or customers elect to compete with us in the digital media market  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline 
we sell our controllers to companies that use our controllers to manufacture flash card products 
many of these customers are large companies that have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition  greater access to flash memory  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and longer standing relationships with customers 
if these companies elected to compete directly with us in the digital media market or in our retail channels  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline 
our financial results may be affected by mandated changes in accounting and financial reporting 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
in particular  changes to fasb guidelines relating to accounting for stock based compensation will likely increase our compensation expense  could make our operating results less predictable in any given reporting period and could change the way we compensate our employees or cause other changes in the way we conduct our business 
changes in securities laws and regulations have increased our costs  further  in the event we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting  or if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective  our business could suffer 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july required changes in our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the number of rules and regulations applicable to us 
table of contents have increased  and will continue to increase  our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more difficult  such as stockholder approval of new option plans 
in addition  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with compliance with section of that law regarding internal control over financial reporting 
these laws and regulations and perceived increased risk of liability could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
we cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
our stock price and those of other technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and  accordingly  our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in august many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  including variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us or by our competitors  departure of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant orders or customers  sales of common stock by our officers and directors  changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  announcements related to our outstanding litigation  and market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole 
in addition  stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies operating performance 
public announcements by companies in our industry concerning  among other things  their performance  accounting practices or legal problems could cause fluctuations in the market for stocks of these companies 
these fluctuations could lower the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance 
risks related to our industry our business will not succeed unless the digital photography market and other markets that use flash media continue to grow and are accepted by consumers 
we currently depend on sales of digital media and connectivity products to digital camera owners for a substantial portion of our revenues  which exposes us to substantial risk in the event the digital photography market does not continue to grow rapidly 
the digital photography market has grown very rapidly over the last several years and may now be reaching maturity and lower growth rates 
the success of this market depends on many factors  including the availability of digital cameras at prices and with performance characteristics comparable to traditional cameras  the availability of digital media that meet users requirements with respect to price  speed  connectivity  capacity and compatibility  the speed at which digital cameras are able to take successive photographs  the ease with which digital files can be transferred to a personal computer or printer  
table of contents the availability of digital image prints comparable in quality and price to traditional photographs  and market conditions in the industry and the economy as a whole 
in addition to the above factors related to the digital photography market as a whole  we believe the following additional factors will affect the successful adoption of digital photography by consumers marketing campaigns that increase brand awareness in end user markets  both domestically and internationally  increased association between brand names and attractive price and performance characteristics  and heightened consumer confidence in digital photography technology 
over the last several years  we have derived the majority of our revenue from the digital camera market 
although other applications such as usb storage devices  cell phones  personal digital assistants and mp players may consume large volumes of flash cards in the near future  today the digital photography market still remains the primary driver of demand for flash cards 
as this market begins to experience slower growth rates  our growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new markets and new products for nand flash memory 
however  if these new applications do not develop  demand for our products may not increase at the same rates as they have in the past 
at the present time  it is unclear whether these new applications will use or continue to use removable digital media 
cell phones  for example  could use embedded rather than removable storage 
in addition  usb storage devices  cell phones or mps could use miniature hard disk technologies rather than flash based digital media 
such developments would likely result in a reduction of anticipated future demand for flash media sales thereby negatively impacting our revenues  revenue growth and gross margins 
there can be no assurance that new markets and products will develop and grow fast enough  or that new markets will adopt nand flash technologies or our products  to enable us to continue our growth 
if the digital photography market does not continue to grow and be accepted by professional  commercial and consumer users  or if any reduction in demand in digital photography is not absorbed by other new applications  we will not continue to grow at the rates that we have in prior years 
general economic conditions  political and military conditions associated with current worldwide conflicts and similar events may prevent consumers from purchasing our products  and reduced demand for digital media and related products may prevent us from achieving targeted revenues and profitability 
our revenues and our ability to return to profitability depend significantly on the overall demand for flash cards and related products 
sales of consumer electronic goods  including our products  have historically been dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers  which may be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
changes in the us and the global economy  such as a decline in consumer confidence or a slowdown in the united states economy  may cause consumers to defer or alter purchasing decisions  including decisions to purchase our products 
if the economy declines as a result of recent economic  political and social turmoil  consumers may reduce discretionary spending and may not purchase our products  which would harm our revenues as softening demand caused by worsening economic conditions has done in the past 
if digital camera manufacturers do not develop and promote products that are able to take advantage of our fastest digital media products  the growth and success of our business may be limited 
we depend on the research and development  marketing and sales efforts of digital camera manufacturers in developing  marketing and selling digital cameras that can use our more advanced existing and future products 
most of the digital cameras currently available on the market do not incorporate technologies that can take advantage of the speed available in our fastest digital film products 
if digital camera manufacturers do not successfully develop  market and sell digital cameras that take full advantage of our most advanced products  from which we realize higher gross margins  the growth and success of our business may be negatively impacted 

table of contents the manufacturing of our products is complex and subject to yield problems  which could decrease available supply and increase costs 
the manufacture of flash memory and controllers is a complex process  and it is often difficult for companies to achieve acceptable product yields 
reduced flash memory yields could decrease available supply and increase costs 
controller yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to the semiconductor foundry 
because low yields may result from either design defects or process difficulties  we may not identify yield problems until well into the production cycle  when an actual product exists and can be analyzed and tested 
in addition  many of these yield problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitors may gain access to our technology  which could harm our ability to successfully compete in our market 
we regard our intellectual property as critical to our success 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  we may be unable to successfully compete in our market 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
as of march   we had been granted or allowed patents in the united states and other countries and had more than pending united states and foreign patent applications 
we cannot assure you  however  that any of our existing or future patents will not be invalidated  patents will be issued for any of our pending applications  any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength  or our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage 
it may also be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
we are involved in intellectual property litigation  and expect to become involved in additional litigation that could divert management s time and attention  be time consuming and expensive to defend and limit our access to important technology 
we are a party to litigation with third parties to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others intellectual property 
we expect to be involved in additional patent litigation in the future 
these lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages 
these lawsuits could also lead to the invalidation of our patent rights 
patent lawsuits are extremely expensive and time consuming and can divert management s time and attention 
when we sue other companies for patent infringement  it may prompt them to respond by suing us for infringement of their patents 
we are also negotiating license agreements with third parties  which could result in litigation if these negotiations are unsuccessful 
additional patent litigation would significantly increase our legal expenses  which would result in higher operational expenses and lower operating margins 
we are currently in patent litigation with toshiba 
in this litigation  we have asserted that toshiba infringes thirteen of our patents through their sale of flash memory chips  cards and cameras 
in a separate action  toshiba has asserted that we infringe eight of toshiba s patents through our sale of flash devices that we manufacture and readers 
such products comprise a substantial portion of our revenues 
if we were found to infringe toshiba s patents or if we were involved in other intellectual property litigation  we could be forced to do one or more of the following pay damages on products that were found to infringe the other party s patents  
table of contents stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  we may incur additional costs or be unable to manufacture and sell our products 
we also do not currently manufacture certain digital media formats and currently purchase such cards from third parties for resale 
not all of our suppliers provide us with indemnification regarding such sales 
other suppliers impose limits on their indemnification obligations 
if such products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party or if we are found to owe license fees or royalties relating to these products  our margins and operating results would be severely negatively impacted 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we sell our products primarily to customers in the us and  to a lesser extent  europe  japan and canada 
most of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  however  we anticipate an increasing amount of our sales will be denominated in british pounds  the japanese yen  the euro and the canadian dollar 
foreign currency denominated revenues were approximately   and of our total product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we purchase our products and the materials and services to build our products primarily from vendors in korea  taiwan  indonesia  china  the united states  the united kingdom  germany and japan 
most of these costs are currently denominated in us dollars  however  we anticipate an increasing amount of our costs will be denominated in the euro  japanese yen  pound sterling and possibly other currencies 
foreign currency denominated costs were approximately   and of our cost of product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result  it is possible that our future financial results could be directly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and the prices of our products would become more expensive in a particular foreign market if the value of the us dollar rises in comparison to the local currency  which may make it more difficult to sell our products in that market 
conversely  the prices of our products would become less expensive in a particular foreign market if the value of the us dollar falls in comparison to the local currency  which may make it easier to sell our products in that market 
we will continue to face foreign currency exchange risk in the future 
therefore  our financial results could be directly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
these risks could become more significant as we expand business outside the us or if we increase sales in non us dollar denominated currencies 
we have adopted and implemented a hedging policy to mitigate these potential risks 
we use forward contracts to mitigate the exposures associated with certain net foreign currency asset or liability positions 
however  we cannot assure you that any policies or techniques that we have implemented  or may implement in the future  will be successful or that our business and financial condition will not be harmed by exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during the year ended december   we entered into hedges on intercompany payables denominated in the british pound and japanese yen 
during the year ended december   the foreign currency exposures on our net asset and liability positions were not fully hedged 
for the year ended december   foreign exchange gains on our foreign currency net asset and liability positions were and were offset by losses on hedging transactions of approximately million 
for the year ended december   gains on our foreign currency net asset and liability positions were million and were offset by losses on hedging transactions of million 
for the year ended december   gains on our foreign currency net asset and liability positions were million and were offset by losses on hedging transactions of million 
as of december   we held forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of million to hedge the risks associated with forecast british pound and japanese yen denominated assets and liabilities 
at december   our aggregate exposure to non us dollar currencies  net of currency hedge contracts  was approximately million 
if  at december   we applied an immediate adverse move in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to these exposures  we would incur a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we earn on our investments and the amount of interest expense we pay on borrowings under our line of credit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates impacts all of our investments because of the short duration of the investments and our borrowings under our line of credit 
accordingly  our interest rate risk is primarily related to our short term investments which amounted to million at december   and our million of borrowings under our line of credit facility with wells fargo bank at december  we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we plan to mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically invested in investment grade  short term securities that we have held until maturity to limit our market risk 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
