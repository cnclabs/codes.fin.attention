item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing therapeutic protein based products for the treatment of human diseases 
the process for taking one of our discoveries to the marketplace is long  complex and very costly 
it is difficult to predict the time it will take to commercialize any given product candidate  but it would not be unusual to span ten years or more and cost hundreds of millions of dollars 
it is also a business of attrition  it is expected that less than of the proteins entering human clinical trials will actually make it to the marketplace 
for the products that do make it  particularly for those that address previously unmet medical needs  the markets can be significant  with a number of successful products selling in excess of billion per year 
an important element of our strategy is that we intend to maintain all or a significant share of the commercial rights to our products in north american markets 
as a result  we will be required to pay a significant portion of the development costs for our product candidates 
a second important element of our strategy is that we are developing a broad portfolio of product candidates to give our company more opportunities to be successful 
we currently have three product candidates in clinical development and expect to add additional proteins to this portfolio in the future 
thus  we are paying a significant portion of development costs for several potential products 
assuming these product candidates progress through clinical development successfully  the cost of clinical trials are expected to increase significantly 
our most significant financial challenges are to obtain adequate funding to cover the cost of product development  and to control spending and direct it toward product candidates that will create the most value for the company s shareholders over the long term 
it can be a complex and highly subjective process to establish the appropriate balance between cash conservation and value generation 
there are a number of important factors that we consider in addressing these challenges  including the following the nature  timing and magnitude of financing transactions  which would typically involve issuance of equity or equity based securities  the nature and timing of product development collaborations  which would typically provide for funding of a portion of the respective product development costs  as well as bring in near term potential revenues in the form of upfront fees and milestone payments  the breadth of product development programs  ie  the number of potential disease indications for which a product candidate is tested in clinical trials  the number of products in our development portfolio and the decision to move new product candidates into clinical development  and periodic assessments of the relative capital requirements  risk and value of each of our product candidates 
we expect that it will be at least four to five years before we can generate enough product related revenues to reach cash flow breakeven 
in the interim  revenues from existing relationships will help to defray our expenses  but additional funding will be required  the amount of which could be significant 
we may decide to enter into additional product development collaborations  which would reduce our funding requirements 
we may also generate funding through licensing of patents that are not relevant to our product development programs 
it is likely that we will continue to look for opportunities to raise equity capital as a primary means of funding our company over the next several years 
the equity markets for biotechnology stocks have tended to experience long cycles during which the sale of equity securities has been extremely difficult 
it is not possible to predict the timing or length of these cycles 
as a result  most biotechnology companies  including ours  have adopted an opportunistic strategy of raising equity capital when it is available 
we believe this strategy is important to minimizing the financial risks to our company and our shareholders 

table of contents results of operations revenues royalties 
we earn royalties on sales of certain products subject to license agreements with novo nordisk  our former parent and current owner of approximately of our outstanding common stock  and several other companies 
royalties increased in and primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar versus foreign currencies prominent in certain royalty calculations 
we expect underlying sales figures to decrease slightly in due to patent expiration in certain countries  however royalty revenue for is expected to be comparable to as a result of the favorable effect of foreign exchange rate differences 
in and  insulin royalties represented of our total royalty revenues 
we have opportunities to earn royalties in the future under other existing license agreements  but we cannot be certain when  or if  products will be sold subject to those licenses 
option fees 
in all three years presented  we earned an annual option fee of million from novo nordisk under an option and license agreement  pursuant to which we have given novo nordisk an option to license certain rights to proteins that we discover 
the initial term of this agreement expired in november  however  novo nordisk exercised its right to extend the agreement in and will pay million per year for two additional years 
in november we received the first of the two annual payments  of which million is recorded as deferred revenue at december  we will receive the final payment under the agreement in november in september  we signed a five year strategic alliance agreement with serono under which serono may acquire rights and licenses to certain leads and targets from our research and development pipeline 
we recorded revenue of  from this agreement in  and million was recorded as deferred revenue  which we expect will be recognized at a rate of million per year 
ig fusion protein license fee 
in  as part of a lawsuit settlement  we earned a million license fee related to the granting of a license to our ig fusion protein patents 
this was a one time payment for a fully paid up license and  therefore  we will not earn any future revenues with respect to this agreement 
license fees and milestones payments 
revenues from license fees and other up front payments are recognized over the period we are contractually required to provide other rights or services that represent continuing obligations 
revenue from license fees and milestone payments increased from to this was primarily due to the license fees and milestones earned from novo nordisk related to rfactor xiii  il and three licenses granted under the option and license agreement 
revenues from license fees and milestone payments increased from to this was primarily due to revenues earned related to an il development collaboration with novo nordisk 
during the fourth quarter of  we signed a license agreement for rfactor xiii with novo nordisk and several license and collaborative development agreements with serono related to the strategic alliance  with substantial upfront payments received from each company 
at december   million related to these agreements was recorded as deferred revenue 
together with amounts deferred under previous license and collaboration agreements  we currently expect the following amounts of deferred revenue to be recognized as license fee revenue in future periods in thousands thereafter total 
table of contents for certain license agreements that require no continuing performance of us  we record license fees as revenue upon execution of the agreement 
we recognize revenues from milestone payments that represent completion of separate and substantive earnings processes when the milestone is achieved and amounts are due and payable 
from year to year  this revenue item can fluctuate substantially based on the completion of new licensing or collaborative agreements and the achievement of development related milestones 
although this revenue item increased both in and due to an increasing number of transactions and milestone payments  we cannot be certain this trend will continue in and beyond due to the uncertain nature of the events generating the revenue 
operating expenses research and development expense 
research and development expense has been our most significant expense to date  consisting primarily of salaries and benefit expenses  costs of consumables  facility costs and external costs 
research and development expense increased in each of the past two years  by in and by in increases over the periods reported largely resulted from significantly increased activities for the development of our current product candidates  rhthrombin  taci ig and il over the past three years  we have experienced a substantial increase in external costs for contract manufacturing  clinical trials and payments to serono related to our taci ig collaboration 
in addition  salaries and benefits have increased primarily due to the addition of approximately employees who are focused on product development 
our expense in reflects an offset of million from costs reimbursed by novo nordisk under an il preclinical collaboration agreement  which ended in early without the impact of this reimbursement  research and development expense would have increased by in these trends are shown in the following table in thousands 
salaries and benefits consumables facility costs external costs depreciation and amortization subtotal il cost reimbursement from novo nordisk net research and development expense we anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to advance  and potentially expand  our internal product development programs 
in  we expect that a number of factors  including the following  will contribute to an increase in research and development expense costs of expanded clinical trial activity for ongoing product development programs  increased staffing to support expanded and advancing product development programs  particularly in the clinical  medical  regulatory  manufacturing and quality areas  and costs of operating our new pilot scale manufacturing facility 
partially offsetting these factors  we have shifted the manufacture of rhthrombin registration lots from late to early  thus deferring significant contract expenses 
as a result  we estimate that research and development expense will increase by less than in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and benefit expenses  professional fees and other corporate costs 
in  we reclassified all patent related costs to 
table of contents general and administrative expenses from research and development expenses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
the amounts reclassified were million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
in  general and administrative expense increased over primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs  including recruiting  an increase in state and local taxes related to transaction fees received  legal costs related to business development activities  and strategic marketing costs in support of planning for rhthrombin commercialization 
in  this expense decreased versus primarily due to a decrease in legal costs related to a patent infringement lawsuit settled in late  a decrease in external costs related to the write off in of design and engineering costs for a terminated construction project  and cost control initiatives undertaken by the company in late and early we anticipate that our general and administrative requirements will increase to support our development programs as they advance towards commercialization 
we estimate that general and administrative expense may increase by up to in as compared to expense 
noncash stock based compensation expense 
in and early  prior to the completion of our initial public offering  stock options were granted to employees and directors at exercise prices below the estimated fair value of the common stock on the date of grant 
as a result  we recorded total deferred stock based compensation of million 
deferred stock based compensation is being amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying options  generally four years  using the straight line method 
the expense declined from to due to cancellation of unvested options held by employees who terminated their employment with the company 
in  the expense increased due to a one time compensation charge of million related to the repayment of loans by certain executives with shares of common stock originally purchased with the loan proceeds 
the compensation expense equaled the difference between the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of the loan payment less the exercise price or the value of the shares previously used as the basis for recording compensation expense 
this increase was partially offset by the cancellation of unvested options held by employees who terminated their employment with the company 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
disclosure of the effect of expensing the fair value of equity compensation is currently required under existing literature see note to the financial statements 
sfas r will become effective for periods beginning after june   which will be in our third fiscal quarter in at that time  we will begin expensing amounts related to employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations 
we have begun  but not completed  the process of evaluating the option valuation methods and adoption transition alternatives available under sfas r 
accordingly  we are not able to provide an estimate of the amount by which our net loss will increase after sfas r is adopted 

table of contents other income expense other income expense consists primarily of investment income and interest expense 
investment income is generated primarily from investment of our cash reserves in investment grade  fixed income securities 
there are three primary factors affecting the amount of investment income that we report amount of cash reserves invested  the effective interest rate  and the amount of gains or losses recognized 
the following table shows how each of these factors affected investment income for the three years reported in thousands 
weighted average amount of cash reserves effective interest rate investment income before gains and losses net gains losses on sales of investments investment income  as reported we have accounted for the sale leaseback transaction completed in october as a financing transaction 
under this method of accounting  an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale is considered a long term interest bearing liability 
rent payments under the leases are considered to be payments toward the liability and are allocated to principal and interest 
we recorded interest of million  million   for the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which we intend to use to fund our operations and capital expenditures over the next several years 
these cash reserves are held in a variety of investment grade  fixed income securities  including corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market instruments 
we believe that our existing cash resources should provide sufficient funding for approximately three years 
cash flows from operating activities 
the amount of cash used to fund our operating activities generally tracks our net losses  with the following exceptions noncash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  gains or losses on sale or disposal of assets  and noncash stock based compensation  which do not result in uses of cash  net realized gains and losses  and amortization of premium on short term investments  which are reflected as sources of cash from investing activities upon maturity or sale of the respective investments  changes in receivables  which generally represent temporary timing differences between the recognition of certain revenues and the subsequent receipt of cash payments  changes in deferred revenue  which reflect the difference in timing between the receipt of cash from option fees  license fees and other upfront payments and the subsequent recognition of these amounts as revenue over the period we are contractually required to provide other rights or services that represent continuing obligations  and changes in other assets and liabilities  which generally represent temporary timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses and their payment 
generally  with the exception of changes in deferred revenue  we do not expect these items to generate material year to year fluctuations in the relationship between our net loss and the amount of net cash used in operating activities 
substantial license or upfront fees may be received upon the date we enter into new licensing or collaborative agreements and be recorded as deferred revenue 
for example  in upon the execution of a strategic alliance agreement with serono and a license agreement with novo nordisk  we recorded million 
table of contents of deferred revenue  which will be recognized as revenue over the next approximately five years 
the timing of these types of transactions is irregular and  thus  has the potential to create fluctuations in the relationship between our net loss and the amount of cash used in operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities 
our most significant use of cash in investing activities is for capital expenditures 
we expend a certain amount each year on routine items to maintain the effectiveness of our business  eg  to adopt newly developed technologies  expand into new functional areas  adapt our facilities to changing needs  and or replace obsolete assets 
in addition  we have used cash to purchase land and expand our facilities 
the following table shows the amount of cash going toward each of these types of capital expenditures in thousands routine equipment facility expenditures purchases of land for future expansion expansion of r d facility  including pilot scale manufacturing plant total the r d facility expansion project had an approved total budget of approximately million including all related equipment costs 
the project was partially funded by an allowance from our landlord  which totaled million and is reflected as cash flow from financing activities 
the project began in april and was completed in mid we expect to spend approximately million to million in on capital equipment 
cash flows from investing activities also reflect large amounts of cash used to purchase short term investments and received from the sale and maturity of short term investments 
these amounts primarily relate to shifts between cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
because we manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not consider these cash flows to be important to an understanding of our liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows from financing activities 
net proceeds from common stock offerings constitute by far the largest element of financing cash flows 
we received million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in  million from an underwritten follow on offering completed in october  and million from the sale of common stock to both amgen and serono in in  we received million of net proceeds from the completion of a sale and leaseback of our headquarter buildings  which has been accounted for as a financing transaction 
our landlord provided an allowance of million to be applied toward the cost of the r d facility expansion project described above 
we received million of this amount in and the remainder in we expect to incur substantial additional costs as we continue to advance and expand our product development programs 
we expect these expenditures to increase over the next several years  particularly if the outcomes of clinical trials are successful 
our plans include the internal development of selected product candidates and the co development of product candidates with collaborators where we would assume a percentage of the overall product development costs 
if  at any time  our prospects for financing these programs decline  we may decide to reduce our ongoing investment in our development programs 
we could reduce our investment by discontinuing our funding under existing co development arrangements  establishing new co development arrangements for other product candidates to provide additional funding sources or out licensing product candidates that we might otherwise develop internally 
additionally  we could consider delaying or discontinuing development of product candidates to reduce the level of our related expenditures 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on several factors  many of which may not be in our control  including results of research and development programs  
table of contents cash flows under existing and potential future arrangements with licensees  collaborators and other parties  costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  and costs associated with the expansion of our facilities 
over the next several years we will need to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
however  financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity based securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders would be reduced  and these securities could have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our development programs or expansion plans  or grant rights to third parties to develop and market product candidates that we would prefer to develop and market internally  with license terms that are not favorable to us 
contractual obligations at december  we are contractually obligated to make payments as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years building lease obligations operating leases development contracts total the building lease obligations  which resulted from the sale leaseback financing transaction  reflect the reset of the lease terms to years beginning may operating lease terms range from one to ten years 
we have certain renewal provisions at our option  which are not reflected in the above table  for the building leases and the operating leases 
the development contracts include the production of phase supply and registration lots of rhthrombin  which may also be used for commercial purposes 
critical accounting estimates royalty revenue 
we earn royalties on two proteins marketed and sold by novo nordisk  insulin and glucagon  which represented of our royalty revenue in royalties are received from novo nordisk quarterly within days after the end of the calendar quarter 
for insulin  the royalties are based on manufacturing costs for the quantity of insulin sold during the quarter 
these costs are calculated in danish kroner  and then converted to us dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the quarter 
royalties earned on sales of glucagon are calculated as a percentage of net sales 
we accrue estimated royalties at the end of each quarter based on historical sales data  estimates provided to us by novo nordisk and changes in the danish kroner to us dollar exchange rate 
adjustments are made in the following quarter reflecting the difference between our estimates and actual reported royalties and  to date  have not been significant 
we also earn royalties on several products marketed by other companies 
royalties on these products are received within to days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we accrue estimated royalties at the end of each quarter based on historical sales data 
adjustments are made in the following quarter reflecting the difference between our estimates and actual reported royalties 
to date  these adjustments have not been significant 

table of contents license and upfront fees 
we enter into various licensing and collaborative agreements that generate significant license or other upfront fees with subsequent milestone payments earned upon completion of development milestones 
we use our best judgment to estimate the period over which we have continuing commitments to perform under these agreements 
revenue from upfront fees is recognized on a straight line basis over this period  which has ranged in duration from six months to ten years 
for certain license agreements that require no continuing performance on our part  license fee revenue is recognized immediately upon execution of the agreement 
stock based compensation 
as permitted by the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we have elected to follow accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for employee stock option grants and apply the disclosure only provisions of sfas to account for our stock option plans 
under apb  compensation expense is based on the excess  if any  of the estimated fair value of our stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option 
prior to the completion of our initial public offering  we granted options with exercise prices that were lower than the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant 
we used our best judgment to estimate the fair value of our stock as of the various grant dates  which resulted in share prices ranging from to 
based on these estimated values  we recorded million of deferred compensation  which is being amortized over the vesting period of the individual options using the straight line method 
we expect to record stock based compensation expense of million  pursuant to apb  through june  effective july  we will record share based compensation in accordance with the recently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations 
we have begun  but not completed  the process of evaluating the option valuation methods and adoption transition alternatives available under sfas r 
accordingly  we are not able to provide an estimate of the amount by which our net loss will increase after sfas r is adopted 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is primarily limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including united states government and agency securities  high grade united states corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial paper and money market funds 
due to the nature of our short term investments  all of which mature within three years  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we have no other material foreign currency exposure  nor do we hold derivative financial instruments
