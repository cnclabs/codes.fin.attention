originating in with the founding of our predecessor  louis harris and associates  we have provided these services utilizing traditional market research and polling methodologies  such as direct mail  telephone based surveys  mall intercepts  focus groups and in person interviews 
in september  we began developing our internet panel and building the technology infrastructure to provide online market research and polling services 
in november  we introduced our first internet based market research and polling services 
since that time  we have grown to become the global leader in online research 
we generally perform traditional and internet based custom research services on a fixed fee basis in response to client generated requests 
hisb performs internet based research for other market research firms on a project by project basis in response to requests from those firms 
business combinations on september   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of wirthlin  a privately held opinion research and strategic consulting firm headquartered in reston  virginia  pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger among us  wirthlin  capitol merger sub  llc and the stockholders of wirthlin 
wirthlin was engaged in businesses in the market research and polling industry that were similar to ours 
this acquisition has created opportunities for revenue growth  cost savings and other synergies including the ability to cross sell to one another s customers  offer more comprehensive and diverse services  and use a combined worldwide network 
this acquisition has also provided the opportunity to convert wirthlin traditional based clients to the internet 
additionally  this acquisition has assisted in our expansion in a number of different service areas including brand and strategic consulting  government and policy  financial services and consumer packaged goods 
our presence in the united kingdom and china has also been strengthened 
on march   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of novatris  a privately owned share corporation organized and existing under the laws of france  for a combination of cash and shares of harris interactive common stock 
novatris was engaged in businesses in the market research and polling industry that were complimentary to ours

table of contents restructuring fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million in restructuring charges directly related to cost reduction initiatives implemented by our management  and in the following quarter completed our accounting for the initiatives by making additional adjustments 
management developed a formal plan that included a reduction in the staffs of both our us and us operations 
as a result of the plan  we also recorded a reserve for a lease commitment related to office space in london  which we leased prior to our acquisition of wirthlin  that we determined was no longer needed as a result of the aforementioned reduction in staff  as well as the integration of the uk operations of wirthlin 
the plan was formally communicated to the affected employees during the third quarter of fiscal the total number of affected employees from our us and us operations was we estimate non cash savings of approximately million and cash savings of approximately million in fiscal from these cost reduction initiatives 
the following table summarizes activity with respect the restructuring charges for the fiscal plan during the year ended june  lease severance commitments total net charge during the third quarter of fiscal cash payments during fiscal fiscal adjustments during fourth quarter remaining reserve at june  as of june   all actions in the plan were completed 
however  cash payments for severance and the lease commitment will be made on a longer term basis according to the contractually scheduled payments of such commitments 
specifically  cash payments for severance will continue through april  and cash payments on the lease commitment will continue through january further financial information about the plan is included in note  restructuring charges  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
discontinued operations during the third quarter of fiscal  we committed to a plan to sell our japanese subsidiaries collectively  hi japan 
at that time  we recorded an anticipated loss on disposal of approximately million 
approximately million of the recorded loss represented the impairment charge for the full amount of the goodwill attributable to hi japan  and approximately million represented a reserve for the anticipated costs of selling the business 
we based our impairment determination on the fact that hi japan did not contribute to our profitability at the level that was anticipated at the time of acquisition 
as a result of recording the goodwill write down and reserve for anticipated costs to sell the business  the book values of the remaining net assets of hi japan approximated their estimated fair value at that time 
on may   we sold hi japan to mr 
minoru aoo  hi japan s former president  for an aggregate purchase price consisting of a cash payment of million and mr 
aoo s surrender to us of  shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of million  determined based on the average closing price of our common stock for the three day period ending may  we subsequently retired all of these shares 
the final loss on disposal as a result of the sale was million and resulted in a capital loss for tax purposes of million 
we did not realize an income tax benefit as a result of the loss on disposal  as the loss is a capital loss  and we have no significant capital gains against which the capital loss can be offset 
as such  the company recorded a full valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset  as more fully described in note  income taxes 
we have classified hi japan as a discontinued operation for the year ended june   consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
as such  the results of operations  net of taxes  and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of hi japan have been 
table of contents reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in this form k as discontinued operations  assets from discontinued operations and liabilities from discontinued operations  respectively 
all prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation

explanation of key financial statement captions revenue from services our revenue from services are derived principally from the following custom research we conduct many types of custom research including  but not limited to  customer satisfaction surveys  market share studies  new product introduction studies  brand recognition studies  reputation studies and ad concept testing 
service bureau research hisb conducts internet based data collection for other market research firms that do not have the necessary internet based market research capabilities themselves 
we recognize revenue from services principally on a proportional performance basis using the cost to cost methodology  which we believe is effectively equivalent to output measures 
progress on a contract can be tracked reliably and is matched against project costs and costs to complete on a periodic basis 
cost of services our direct costs associated with generating revenues principally consist of the following items project personnel project personnel have four distinct roles project management  survey design  data collection and analysis 
we maintain project personnel in the united states  europe  and asia 
labor costs are specifically allocated to the project to which they relate 
we utilize an automated timekeeping system  which tracks the time of project personnel as incurred for each specific revenue generating project 
panelist incentives our panelists receive both cash and non cash incentives through programs such as our hipoints loyalty program for participating in our surveys 
we award cash incentives to our panelists for participating in surveys  and our panelists earn these incentives when we receive a timely survey response 
non cash incentives  specifically  points  are awarded to market survey respondents who register for our online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join our online panel 
the earned points  which are non transferable  may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to expiration  which occurs after one year of account inactivity 
data processing we manage the processing of survey data using our own employees 
we also engage third party suppliers to perform data processing on an as needed basis 
other direct costs other direct costs include direct purchases  principally labor and materials  related to data collection and analysis 
sales and marketing expenses we employ sales and marketing professionals to support the sales and marketing of our traditional and internet based market research services 
our sales professionals are compensated based upon the delivery of projects and recognition of revenue on those projects 
commissions are accrued based upon the delivery of completed projects to our clients 
additionally  our sales professionals are supported by a staff of marketing professionals who design product pricing and promotional strategies 
furthermore  labor costs associated with project personnel during periods when they are not working on specific revenue generating projects but rather  are participating in our selling efforts  are also included in sales and marketing expenses 

table of contents general and administrative expenses we employ staff in the areas of finance  human resources  information technology and executive management 
additionally  general and administrative expenses include the labor costs attributable to project personnel when they are not working on specific revenue generating projects or are not participating in our selling efforts 
provision for income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently effective tax rates 
furthermore  deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is necessary to reduce a deferred tax asset to an amount that we expect to realize in the future 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize these benefits if a reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that these benefits will be realized 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the most significant of these areas involving difficult or complex judgments made by management with respect to the preparation of our financial statements in fiscal include revenue recognition  provision for uncollectible accounts  restructuring charges  discontinued operations  valuation of intangible assets and other long lived assets  valuation of goodwill  realizability of deferred tax assets and tax contingencies  hipoints loyalty program  and post employment payments 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue from services is principally recognized on a proportional performance basis using the cost to cost methodology  which we believe is effectively equivalent to output measures 
this revenue includes amounts billed to our clients to cover subcontractor costs and other direct out of pocket expenses 
losses expected to be incurred  if any  on jobs in progress are charged to income as soon as such losses become known 
revisions to estimated costs and differences between actual contract losses and estimated contract losses would affect both the timing of revenue allocated and the results of our operations 
provision for uncollectible accounts we maintain provisions for uncollectible accounts and estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers deteriorates  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  or if client disputes arise that delay or jeopardize payments  additional allowances may be required 
our provisions are provided for in the consolidated financial statements and are monitored by management to ensure that they are consistent with management s expectations 
credit risk is limited with respect to accounts receivable by the company s large customer base 

table of contents restructuring charges restructuring charges represent costs incurred to better align our cost structure with the needs of our business 
restructuring charges include severance related to reductions in staff and related expenses as well as costs related to the consolidation of facilities 
costs for the consolidation of facilities are comprised of future obligations under the terms of the leases for identified excess space and asset impairment charges for fixed assets related to these spaces  less anticipated income from subleasing activities  if any 
estimates and assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis to reflect new developments and prevailing economic conditions 
if actual conditions are more or less favorable than those we project  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses accordingly 
discontinued operations discontinued operations are defined in sfas no 
as a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale if both the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
sfas no 
further provides that the assets and liabilities of the component of the entity that has been classified as discontinued operations be presented separately in the entity s balance sheet 
consistent with this approach  the results of the operations net of taxes and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of hi japan have been classified as discontinued operations  assets from discontinued operations and liabilities from discontinued operations  respectively 
all prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
valuation of intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the underlying assets or their physical condition and significant adverse industry or market trends 
in the event that the carrying value of an asset is determined to be unrecoverable  we would record an adjustment to the carrying value of that asset 
valuation of goodwill with respect to goodwill  we complete an impairment test on an annual basis 
in performing this annual test  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
in the event that the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we would record an adjustment to the reporting unit s goodwill for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value 
in addition to the annual impairment analysis  we also assess the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
consistent with this approach  we recorded a million impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal  which amount represented the full amount of the goodwill attributable to the operations hi japan  which have been classified as discontinued operations for the year ended june   and reclassified as such for all prior periods presented 
realizability of deferred tax assets and tax contingencies we evaluate the valuation allowance and potential realization of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income 
as a result of our positive operating performance in fiscal and the more favorable near term outlook for profitability in fiscal  a portion of our valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  with a resultant benefit to income and goodwill 
as a result of the continued profitable operating performance in 
table of contents fiscal and continued outlook for profitability in fiscal  the remaining us valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of  with a resultant benefit to income  goodwill and equity 
we maintain a valuation allowance of approximately million related to harris interactive europe for net operating loss carryforwards of million 
we also maintain a valuation allowance of approximately million for a capital loss of million which resulted from the sale of hi japan in may further financial information about income taxes is included in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
in addition  we continually evaluate our tax contingencies and recognize a liability when we believe that it is probable that a liability exists 
actual outcomes that differ from our estimate of potential exposure may have a material impact on our results of operations 
hipoints loyalty program since july  we have had a loyalty program  hipoints  whereby points are awarded to market survey respondents who register for our online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join our online panel 
the earned points  which are non transferable  may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to expiration  which occurs after one year of account inactivity 
we maintain a reserve for our obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points  which is calculated based on the expected redemption rate of the points 
this expected redemption rate is estimated based on our actual redemption rates since the inception of the program 
an actual redemption rate that differs from this estimated redemption rate may have a material impact on our results of operations 
post employment payments we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executives which obligate us to make payments for varying periods of time and under terms and circumstances set forth in the agreements 
in part  the payments are in consideration for obligations of the executives not to compete with us after termination of their employment and  in part  the payments relate to other relationships between the parties 
consistent with this approach  during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a cost of million to reflect payment obligations over the succeeding months to dr 
gordon s 
black  our former executive chairman  and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a cost of million to reflect payment obligations over the succeeding months to theresa a 
flanagan  former group president  customer loyalty management 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a cost of million to reflect a lump sum payment made to robert e 
knapp  our former chairman and chief executive officer 
results of operations the operations of wirthlin have been fully integrated into ours and thus  can no longer be tracked separately 
references to the impact of wirthlin in the discussion of continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  are based upon our assumption that the impact of wirthlin on our continuing operations has continued in a manner similar to the effect tracked by us in the quarter following the acquisition 
in addition  the results of continuing operations for the years ended june  and  as presented and discussed herein  do not include the results of our discontinued japanese operations

us revenue increased by million to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase in us revenue is due principally to our september acquisition of wirthlin 
european revenue increased by million to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase in european revenue is due principally to our september acquisition of wirthlin 
of this increase  million was as a result of exchange rate differences from the weakening of the us dollar against the british pound 
revenue from internet based services was million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for the same prior year period 
european internet based revenues increased to million or of total european revenues for fiscal  compared with million or of total european revenues for the same prior year period 
this increase was the result of our continued efforts to build our european panel  as well as our acquisition of novatris in march novatris contributed million in revenue from internet based services during fiscal the decrease in internet revenue as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal compared with fiscal is attributable to the september acquisition of wirthlin  whose business relied principally on traditional methods of collecting data 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million or of total revenue during fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal drivers of gross profit include changes in overall revenue  as discussed above  as well as the mix of revenue and cost components on each project eg project personnel time  data processing and data collection

lastly  general and administrative expense includes unbillable project personnel time of approximately million for fiscal  compared with approximately million for fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal while depreciation and amortization expense remained fairly consistent as a percentage of total revenue  the dollar increase is principally due to the depreciation and amortization associated with the fixed and intangible assets that we acquired as a result of our acquisition of wirthlin in september restructuring charges 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million as a result of a reduction in staff of both our us and european operations 
costs incurred during fiscal associated with the reduction in staff were million 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we also recorded a million reserve for a lease commitment related to office space in london  which was leased by us prior to the acquisition of wirthlin  that we determined was no longer needed as a result of the aforementioned reduction in staff  along with the integration of the european operations of wirthlin 
no such restructuring charges were recorded during fiscal interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income totaled million or of total revenue for fiscal  a slight increase over net interest and other income of million or of revenue for fiscal income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million for fiscal  compared with an income tax benefit of million for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was  which differed from an anticipated effective tax rate of principally due to the effects of a change in estimate during fiscal associated with state tax apportionment factors  partially attributable to the company s acquisition of wirthlin in september as a result of our deferred tax asset of million principally related to our federal net operating loss carryforwards  which are in excess of million  income tax expense will principally be a non cash item for us for fiscal and the foreseeable future

european internet based revenues increased to million or of total european revenue in fiscal  compared with million or of total european revenue in fiscal  as a result of our continued efforts to build our european panel  along with our acquisition of novatris in march as our internet based business model continued to mature and expand and we saw increased conversion of existing work to the internet  traditional revenue decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased to million or of revenue during fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal  principally due to the growth in internet related business relative to overall revenue growth  as discussed above

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million or of revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of revenue  for fiscal both the dollar and percentage increases were attributable to the increased headcount for our sales force in both the united states and united kingdom 
the increased costs for sales and marketing during fiscal are consistent with both the increased revenue as compared to fiscal  as well as management s planned increase in our sales force during fiscal and into fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million or of revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of revenue for fiscal the dollar increase is largely due to a million increase in incentive compensation related expenses including salaries  fringe benefits and bonuses  related to the continued growth of our business 
our costs for database development also increased million in fiscal compared with the prior year as we continued to expand our database panel in the united states and western europe 
however  the increased database development costs were offset by decreased telecommunication costs of million as a result of the closing of call centers in the united states and united kingdom 
other increases in general and administrative expenses during fiscal included increased rent expense of million and million as a result of the addition of novatris in march  as well as other costs related to changes in our executive officers and the consolidation of operations in the united kingdom 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal as we continued our cost saving efforts and stabilized operating expenses 
included within our cost saving efforts in fiscal was the decreased usage and eventual closing of our last telephone center in the united states in june of  as well as the consolidation of operations in the united kingdom 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal during fiscal  we continued to maintain our major systems established and assets acquired in prior years and as a result  capital expenditures continued to decline  which resulted in a corresponding decline in depreciation expense 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income totaled million for fiscal and fiscal throughout fiscal  while we had cash and marketable securities to invest  generated principally from operations  earnings on the increased investment balances were offset by lower interest rates 
net cash and marketable securities totaled million at june   compared with million at june  income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  compared with a benefit of million in fiscal the benefits recorded during fiscal and were principally the result of the reversal of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
at the end of fiscal  it was determined that it was more likely than not that we would utilize additional net operating losses in the near future and therefore  a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed 
at the end of fiscal  after achieving two consecutive fiscal years of net income  it was determined even more likely that we will utilize all of our us net operating losses and therefore  the remaining us valuation allowance was reversed 
significant factors affecting company performance internet and traditional revenue mix we believe that the advantages afforded to our clients by our ability to collect data over the internet  our proprietary internet response weighting system  our large panel and specialty sub panels continue to give us a competitive advantage which we believe has been a driver in our achievement of overall growth rates that exceeded industry averages based upon the most recent data published by inside research in september although we continue to work to convert projects to the internet in the united states  we believe that our primary growth opportunity is in europe 
our ability to change our internet mix in europe is principally 
table of contents dependent upon our success in maintaining the size and quality of our respondent panel and increasing customer acceptance of internet based work 
we expect the globalization of the internet portion of our business to continue over the next several years 
the mix of internet revenue is a factor in our gross profit  which also is affected by our ability to achieve favorable margins on traditional methods of data collection 
data collection costs are only one component of our costs of delivering work 
market research industry specific factors significantly impact our profitability including  among others  project management  both as to pricing and cost utilization and realization rates for professional time  and value added  which is revenue less principally out sourced direct project costs 
because many of our contracts are performed on a fixed fee basis  management of pricing as well as control of the cost of delivery directly impact gross profitability 
the profitability of the professional services component of work directly reflects our ability to capture and bill time spent on projects  as well as to control project personnel time that is not directly related to specific revenue generating projects 
we consider all of the revenue from a project to be internet based whenever more than of the surveys were completed over the internet 
internet revenue as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal was on a global basis and in the united states 
internet based data collection involves certain fixed costs  including data collection costs  panel incentives and costs associated with the development and maintenance of underlying databases and internet technology 
however  once the fixed costs of database development and maintenance are absorbed  increases in volume of internet based work and related revenues tend to have a progressively increasing impact on profitability  assuming that project professional service components and pricing are comparable and operating expenses continue to be managed in the ordinary course 
internet projects may have a traditional data collection component  particularly in multi country studies involving regions in which internet databases are not fully developed 
the traditional data collection component will tend to decrease the profitability of the project  even though it is considered to be an internet project because a majority of the completed surveys come are collected via the internet 
profitability is also decreased by direct costs of outsourcing and pass through costs applicable to particular projects 
development of global database our global database of more than six million double opted in internet survey respondents continues to be a critical component of our success 
we believe that our multi million participant us database continues to be adequate to service our us internet based business  and intend to continue to develop our us database at a rate that is commensurate with the overall size of our us business 
in fiscal  we began to conduct more internet based projects in europe and continue our initiative to build a european database 
to that end  we have entered into various name acquisition agreements that resulted in names being added regularly to the european database 
our initiative was helped significantly with the acquisition of novatris and its nearly one million member panel in march this initiative to increase our european database continued throughout fiscal and as of june  our european database included almost two million names 
we intend to continue to expand the european panel  in order to support the growth of internet based research in europe 
additionally  in both the us and in europe  we intend to continue efforts to enhance existing and build new specialty sub panels 
the amount of our investments in names for our databases will continue to vary  particularly quarter by quarter  based upon factors such as panel availability  opportunities that arise for acquisition or development of panels in specialty or under represented groups  client demand and attrition 
by their nature  internet databases experience participant attrition 
there are no standard measurement systems for such attrition  particularly in the internet survey response field 
measurement involves complex variables 
for example  determining attrition by lack of response from a panelist for a set length of time since last contact is not necessarily reflective of expected long term attrition 
the panelist may not have had an interest in responding regarding particular survey topics offered over a period of time but may  after an absence  respond to a later survey covering a topic of particular interest to that panelist 
moreover  panelists who receive what they perceive to be excessively frequent survey requests tend to have higher than normal rates of attrition 
thus  percentage rates of attrition may not be comparable or meaningful within the industry 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease of million from fiscal to fiscal was partially driven by a decrease in income from continuing operations  net of non cash items  such as depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges  net of cash payments 
in addition  the decrease was also due in part to an increase in accounts receivable of million as a result of our september acquisition of wirthlin  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and million  respectively  both of which were principally the result of our september acquisition of wirthlin 
the positive cash flows in fiscal and fiscal were principally the result of our generating net income during each year as compared to the funding of net losses in fiscal the increased cash provided by operating activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal was principally due to the increased income before income taxes  as the tax benefits reflected in net income during each period were essentially non cash items

we received cash of million in fiscal as a result of issuances of common stock and stock option exercises  offset by the repayment of million in outstanding notes acquired in connection with the september acquisition of wirthlin 
cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal was entirely due to issuances of common stock and stock option exercises 
we received cash of million in fiscal as a result of issuances of common stock and stock option exercises  offset by the repayment of million in long term borrowings 
at june    and  we had no short term or long term borrowings which were outstanding 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  an increase of from million at june  in addition  we also had million in marketable securities at june   a decrease of from million at june  based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy the cash requirements that we anticipate are necessary to support our planned operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that our underlying assumed levels of revenue and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations  if we acquire additional businesses or if accounts receivable or other assets were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financing or other arrangements 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
at june   we had  and continue to maintain  lines of credit with commercial banks providing borrowing availability up to million  at the prime interest rate at june  
borrowings under these arrangements are due upon demand 
there were no borrowings under these agreements at june  or these lines of credit are collateralized by our assets and are subject to certain non financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at june  additionally  we maintain a letter of credit for million approximately million based on the june  euro to us dollar conversion rate  which serves as collateral for the contingent purchase price related to our 
table of contents acquisition of novatris during the quarter ended march  this letter of credit reduces our borrowing capacity against the million line of credit 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to  market acceptance of our services  the resources we allocate to the continuing development of our internet infrastructure and internet panel  the marketing and selling of our services  our promotional activities and our acquisition activities 
management anticipates that expenditures for property  plant and equipment and working capital requirements throughout fiscal will be at levels below those of the second half of fiscal in order to continue to generate revenue  we must constantly develop new business  both for growth and to replace non renewed projects 
although work for no one client constitutes more than of the our revenue  we have had to  and in the future will likely have to  find significant amounts of replacement and additional revenue as customer relationships and work for continuing customers change 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent not only on execution of our business plan  but also on general market factors outside of our control 
many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary 
as a result  as economic conditions decline in any of our markets  our ability to generate revenue is adversely impacted

risk factors the market research industry is vulnerable to general economic conditions 
the market research industry tends to be adversely affected by slow or depressed business conditions in the market as a whole 
many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary 
as general economic conditions decline and our customers seek to control variable costs  projects to be performed by us may be delayed or cancelled  and new project bookings may slow 
as a result  our growth and earnings may be adversely impacted 
we face intense competitive pressures within the market research and polling industry and from others who have the ability to collect data over the internet 
the market research and polling industry includes many competitors  some of whom are much larger than we are or have specialized products and services we do not offer 
consolidation within the industry may result in some of our competitors acquiring internet data collection capabilities through mergers and acquisitions 
such consolidation may result in a loss of business to our service bureau 
in addition  many other companies have  or are developing  large internet databases of individuals with whom they can communicate via the internet 
such companies may themselves  or in arrangements with other market research firms  choose to provide competitive data collection services 
as others increase their ability to offer internet based data collection services  and as our competitors develop alternative products  we may come under increasing pressures in selling and pricing our products and services 
no one customer accounts for more than of our revenues and most of our revenues are derived on a project by project basis 
we must continuously replace completed work with new projects  and these competitive pressures may make it more difficult for us to do so and to sustain and grow our revenues 

table of contents if we are unable to maintain adequate size and demographic composition of our existing internet panel  or if we are required to spend substantial funds to do so  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our success is highly dependent on our ability to obtain and retain an adequate number of panelists in our internet panel and its specialty sub panels 
our ability to maintain an adequate online panel or increase internet revenues may be harmed if a significant number of our current online panelists decide that they are no longer willing to participate in our surveys  we lose a large number of online panelists from over use  and then must rely on a limited number of online panelists for ongoing research  we are unable to attract an adequate number of replacement panelists and specialty sub panel members  or new regulatory requirements related to unsolicited email communications  so called spam  make it impractical for us to continue operations as currently conducted 
there are no industry or other benchmarks for determining the optimal size and composition of an internet panel 
among other factors  panelist response rates differ with differing survey content  and the frequency with which panelists are willing to respond to survey invitations is variable 
although we believe that our current panel is adequate for the foreseeable future to accommodate our clients broad based survey requests in the united states and most of western europe  circumstances could change due to the factors described above 
additionally  we are not always able to accommodate client requests related to limited populations with particular demographic characteristics 
we constantly reassess our panel size and demographics as survey requests are made and  based upon availability of existing panelists to fulfill project requests  determine our need to recruit additional panelists over time 
in general  if the number of our active survey respondents significantly decreases  or the demographic composition of our internet panel narrows  our ability to provide our clients with accurate and statistically projectable information would likely suffer 
this risk is likely to increase as our business expands 
for example  our internet panel is surveyed for our own studies as well as for studies conducted for other market research firms by hisb 
our business will be unable to grow and will suffer if we have an insufficient number of panelists to respond to our surveys  or if our panel becomes unreliable due to reduced size or it is not representative of the general population 
our online panelists are not obligated to participate in our surveys and polls and there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so 
we use our hipoints  histakes and instant results programs to provide incentives to encourage participation in our surveys and to maintain the size of our internet panel 
if these programs lose their effectiveness in the future  a reduction in size or responsiveness of the panel could result 
a breach of our internet security measures or security concerns  or liability arising from the use of the personal information of our internet panel  could adversely affect our business 
a failure in our security measures could result in the misappropriation of private data 
as a result  we may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
internet security concerns could cause some online panelists to reduce their participation levels  provide inaccurate responses or end their membership in our internet panel 
this could harm our credibility with our current clients 
if our clients become dissatisfied  they may stop using our products and services 
in addition  dissatisfied and lost clients could damage our reputation 
a loss of online panelists or a loss of clients would hurt our efforts to generate increased revenues 

table of contents we could be subject to liability claims by our online panelists for any misuse of personal information 
these claims could result in costly litigation 
in addition  the federal trade commission ftc and other domestic and international agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
we could incur additional costs and expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information  are introduced or if our privacy practices are investigated by the ftc or another governmental body 
we may be subject to liability for publishing or distributing content over the internet 
we may be subject to claims relating to content that is published on or downloaded from our websites 
we also could be subject to liability for content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites 
for example  as part of our surveys panelists sometimes access  through our websites or linkages to client websites  content provided by our clients such as advertising copy that may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies 
we also recruit panelists to participate in research sponsored and hosted by our clients on the client s website  and we cannot completely control breaches of privacy policies  warranties  or other claims that may be made by those third parties 
we may be accused of sending bulk unsolicited email and have our email blocked by one or more internet service providers isp s and  therefore  be unable to conduct online data collection 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type  such as defamation or trademark infringement  or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
in addition  any claims of this type  with or without merit  would result in the diversion of our financial resources and management personnel 
changes in government regulation could limit our internet activities or result in additional costs of doing business on the internet 
any future legislation or regulations or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet could limit our effectiveness in conducting internet based market research and polling  and increase our operating expenses 
for example in february  the federal communications commission issued a declaratory ruling interpreting the telecommunications act of to allow local exchange carriers to receive reciprocal compensation for traffic delivered to information service providers  particularly internet service providers  on the basis that traffic bound for isp s is largely interstate 
as a result of this ruling  the costs of transmitting data over the internet may increase 
a significant majority of us state legislatures have enacted laws regulating the distribution of unsolicited email 
such laws could force changes in the manner in which we are able to recruit and communicate with panelists 
the controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act of can spam was enacted 
can spam imposes a number of restrictions and requirements related to commercial communications over the internet 
can spam also gives more legal ammunition for isp s to take spammers to court  allows the ftc to impose fines and gives state attorneys general the power to bring lawsuits 
any inability on our part to comply with can spam and similar laws could add to our costs and force changes in the way in which we conduct business 
in addition  the application of existing laws to the internet could expose us to substantial liability for which we might not be indemnified by content providers or other third parties 
existing laws and regulations currently address  and new laws and regulations and industry self regulatory initiatives are likely to address  a variety of issues  including  among others  the following email distribution  user privacy and expression  the rights and safety of children  
table of contents intellectual property  information security  anti competitive practices  the convergence of traditional channels with internet commerce  taxation and pricing  and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
those laws that do reference the internet have limited interpretation by the courts and their applicability and scope are not well defined  particularly on an international basis 
any new laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect our business 
changes in industry practices could limit our internet activities 
industry standards related to the internet are still evolving 
moreover  some private entities have proposed their own standards for communications with  and use of information related to  individuals who use the internet 
isp s also have the ability to disrupt our communications with our panel 
although we believe that we maintain high standards for the recruitment of members into our database  communications with our panelists and use of information provided by our respondents  some isp s and or self appointed industry regulators may not agree 
as a result  our communications with our panelists may be disrupted from time to time 
any failure in the performance of our internet based technology infrastructure could harm our business 
because a greater proportion of our business than those of many of our competitors involves internet based data collection  our business may suffer a greater impact due to any internet related system failure 
any future internet related system delays or failures  including network  software or hardware failures  that cause an interruption in our ability to communicate with our internet panel  collect research data  or protect visual materials included in our surveys  could result in reduced revenue  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  and could impair our reputation 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  earthquake  flooding  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins and similar events 
one supplier of our secure off site web hosting facilities currently maintains approximately one third of our servers at one facility  and the redundancy of our systems may not be adequate as we depend upon the supplier and others to protect our systems and operations from the events described above 
we have experienced technical difficulties and downtime of individual components of our systems in the past  and we believe that technical difficulties and downtime may occur from time to time in the future 
the impact of technical difficulties and downtime may be severe 
we have developed  however have not fully implemented  a formal disaster recovery plan  and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to failures in our systems 
our servers and software must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic 
any increase in demands on our servers beyond that which we currently anticipate  will require us to fund the expansion and modification of our network infrastructure 
if we were unable to add additional software and hardware to accommodate increased demand  unanticipated system disruptions and slower data collection would likely result 
our internet panel members communicate with us using various isp s 
these providers have experienced significant outages in the past  from time to time may block certain communications  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties unrelated to our systems in the future 
major components of the internet backbone itself could fail due to terrorist attack  war or natural disaster 
our business is particularly vulnerable to such failure because not only would we suffer the effects experienced by businesses in general  we would be unable to perform internet surveys  which are the core of 
table of contents much of our business 
we thus would have to find alternative means to conduct surveys or would be unable to effectively service the needs of many of our clients 
if we do not continue to keep pace with rapid technological change within the market research and polling industry  we will not be able to successfully implement our business plan 
the markets for our products and services are highly competitive 
our ongoing success will depend on our continued ability to improve the performance features and reliability of our products and services 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new products and services 
we could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure to adapt to these changes 
failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business 
our success and ability to compete depends substantially on our internally developed methodologies  technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
we have registered a number of our trademarks  including harris interactive and the harris poll 
if we were prevented from using the harris name  our brand recognition and business would likely suffer 
we would have to make substantial financial expenditures to promote and rebuild our brand identity 
currently  we have pending trademark applications for a number of our products and services 
we also have patent applications currently pending for our conceptloc encryption system and our system and method for conducting product configuration research over a computer based network 
in addition  we may apply for additional trademarks or patents in the future 
our patent or trademark applications may not be approved  or if approved  our patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
we cannot guarantee that infringement or other claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future  whether resulting from our internally developed intellectual property or licenses or content from third parties 
any future assertions or prosecutions could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to pay money damages  introduce new trademarks  develop non infringing technology  or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
any of those events could substantially increase our operating expenses and potentially reduce our expected revenues 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with parties with whom we do business  and generally control access to  and distribution of  our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our technologies 
the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we also rely on off the shelf technologies that we license from third parties 
off the shelf technology refers to generally commercially available software that is not customized for a particular user 
these third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the inability to use licensed technology that is important to our business could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost 
in the future  we may seek to license additional technology to enhance our current technology infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that any such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in providing our products and services until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
our international growth is dependent in part upon expansion of our international internet panel in key regions 
key components of our strategy are the extension of our internet based market research products and services to clients internationally  expansion of our internet panel to include global online panelists and development of strategic alliances globally 
if worldwide internet usage does not continue to grow  we may be unable to attract international online panelists to our internet panel or clients for our internet based market 
table of contents research and polling products and services 
our inability to attract panel members in key regions  including particularly western europe  would hinder our ability to serve the needs of our customers who do business internationally 
we have estimated that our ability to effectively provide broad based internet research in western europe requires a european panel with at least one million respondents 
our european panel now exceeds that size  but our future growth in europe may be constrained if we cannot increase the size of our european panel commensurate with that growth 
the optimal size of our panel in specific countries is subject to the same uncertainty as is applicable to our existing panel in the united states 
our international growth will be adversely affected if the marketplace does not continue to convert to internet based market research and polling 
although internet based research has achieved general acceptance in the united states  the success of our international business will depend on our ability to continually develop and market internet based products and services that achieve broad market acceptance internationally 
in particular  our clients in western europe must continue to accept the internet as an attractive replacement for traditional market research methodologies  such as direct mail  telephone based surveys  mall intercepts  focus groups and in person interviews 
some european clients have expressed concern that internet users do not yet accurately reflect their applicable population  and that any information collected via the internet will be inherently biased 
if our current and potential clients do not continue to accept our internet based methodologies as reliable and unbiased  our revenues may not meet expectations or may decline  and our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
our business is largely dependent on the continued development and worldwide growth of the internet 
the internet may not grow  or may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this growth 
if internet usage continues to grow  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
varying factors could inhibit future growth or the ability of the internet infrastructure to adequately support the growth in internet usage  including inadequate network infrastructure  security concerns  inconsistent quality of service  and unavailability of cost effective  high speed service 
our internet panel depends on isp s  online service providers and other website operators for access to the internet and our websites 
many websites have experienced interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if worldwide internet usage declines  or grows at a significantly slower rate than projected  our ability to maintain our current internet panel  expand our global internet panel and gather research data and information around the world will decrease  which would likely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on services provided by off shore providers  the disruption of which could adversely impact our business 
we rely on off shore providers in countries such as india  costa rica and romania  to provide certain of our programming services  as well as telephone and internet data collection 
political or economic instability in countries from which such support services are provided  or a significant increase in the costs of such services  could adversely affect our business 
from time to time laws and regulations are proposed in the united states that would restrict or limit the benefits of off shore operations  and enactment of legal restrictions could harm our results of operations 

table of contents if we are unable to overcome other risks associated with global operations  we will be unable to conduct business on a global level 
because many of our larger competitors have global operations  our expansion must  in part  be global 
our international operations have either lost money or not added significantly to our net income in recent years 
our operational  technical  and financial systems and controls will have to continue to adapt to a more diversified geographic base of operations 
managing and sustaining our international growth  and ensuring its profitability  will place significant demands on management 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan at projected levels 
the following additional risks are inherent in doing business on a global level export controls relating to encryption technology  inability to comply with or enactment of more restrictive privacy laws  changes in regulatory requirements  currency exchange fluctuations  problems in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  potentially adverse tax consequences  political instability  internet access restrictions  and anti american sentiment or terrorist activity against american interests abroad 
we have little or no control over these risks 
we have encountered more restrictive privacy laws in connection with our business operations in europe  which have inhibited our ability to develop our european internet panel 
we have also experienced currency exchange fluctuations  the impact of which has not been material 
as we increase our global operations in the future  we may experience some or all of these risks  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continue to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  sales and client support personnel 
project managers with industry expertise are important to our ability to retain and expand our business 
intense competition for these personnel exists  and we may be unable to attract  integrate or retain the proper numbers of sufficiently qualified personnel that our business plan assumes 
in the past  we have from time to time experienced difficulty hiring and retaining qualified employees 
there are few  if any educational institutions that provide specialized training related to market research 
employees therefore must be recruited in competition with other industries and few of those who are recruited have direct or substantial experience with internet research 
in the past  competition for highly skilled employees has resulted in additional costs for recruitment  compensation and relocation or the provision of remote access to our facilities 
we may continue in the future to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications 
to the extent that we are unable to hire and retain skilled employees in the future  our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
variations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have in the past  and may in the future  fluctuate significantly and we may incur losses in any given quarter 
our future results of operations may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock would likely decline 

table of contents factors that are outside of our control  and that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past or that may affect us in the future  include declines in general economic conditions or the budgets of our clients  a general decline in the demand for market research and polling products and services  seasonal decreases in demand for market research and polling services  development of equal or superior products and services by our competitors  technical difficulties that cause general and long term failure of the internet  and currency fluctuations 
factors that are partially within our control  and that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past or that may affect us in the future  include our relative mix of internet based and traditional market research and polling businesses  technical difficulties associated with the investments in and maintenance of our own systems that negatively affect our operations  our ability to maintain the proper size and scope of our internet panel necessary to develop and sell new products and services and generate expected revenues  our ability to recruit respondents into our sub panels  such as our it decision makers  to conduct high value research for our clients  and development of our own new  marketable products and services 
the factors listed above may affect both our quarter to quarter operating results as well as our long term success 
you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations or any other trend in our performance as an indication of our future results 
the price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile and these securities may be overvalued from time to time 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations 
if financial operating results do not improve or improve at a slower rate than we anticipate  or if operating or capital expenditures exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly  or if some other event adversely affects us  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
in addition  if the market for internet related stocks or the stock market in general experiences an additional loss in investor confidence or declines again  the market price of our common stock could fall for reasons unrelated to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
investors might be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the purchase price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were to become the subject of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our charter could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
our restated certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our board of directors into three classes  eliminates the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting  and provides our board of directors with the power to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
the preferred stock could have voting  dividend  liquidation  and other rights established by the board of directors that are superior to those of our common stock 
our board of directors also adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock outstanding as of march   and one right attaches to each share issued thereafter until a specified date 
unless redeemed by us prior to the time the rights are 
table of contents exercised  upon the occurrence of certain events  the rights will entitle the holders to receive upon exercise of each right shares of our preferred stock  or shares of an acquiring entity  having a value equal to the exercise price of the right divided by of the then market price of our common stock 
the issuance of the rights could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law contains provisions that impose restrictions on stockholder action to acquire our company 
the effect of these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could discourage or prevent third parties from seeking to obtain control of us  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might receive a premium for their shares over prevailing market prices 
potential acquisitions of  or investments in  other companies may not be available and or have a negative impact on our business 
we have in the past and may in the future acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  services  products or technologies 
if we choose not to pursue acquisitions  are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or unable acquire them at reasonable prices and or on reasonable terms  our rate of growth may slow 
if we choose to pursue acquisitions  some material risks are difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired business  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the availability of favorable acquisition financing  and the potential loss of key employees and or customers of any acquired business 
acquisitions may require the use of significant amounts of cash  resulting in the inability to use those funds for other business purposes 
acquisitions using our capital stock could have a dilutive effect  and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
amortization of intangible assets would reduce our earnings  which in turn could negatively influence the price of our common stock 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of operating in foreign markets  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions 
we have international sales and continuing operations in the united kingdom  france  hong kong  belgium and china 
therefore  we are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
non us sales are denominated in the functional currencies of the respective countries in which our foreign subsidiaries reside 
our total consolidated assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for each period presented 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
we measure our risk related to foreign currency rate exposure on two levels  the first being the impact of operating results on the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the functional currency of their home country  and the second being the extent to which we have instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
foreign exchange translation gains and losses are included in our results of operations as a result of consolidating the results of our continuing international operations  which are denominated in each country s functional currency  with our us results 
the impact of translation gains or losses on net income from consolidating foreign subsidiaries were not material for the periods presented 
we have historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates upon consolidating our foreign subsidiaries with our us results  due to the size of our foreign operations in comparison to our us operations 
while the united kingdom now contributes significantly to our revenues  we continue to believe that our exposure to 
table of contents foreign currency fluctuation risk is low  given that our united kingdom operations have historically produced low operating profits 
however  if the operating profits in the united kingdom increase and we continue to expand in europe  our exposure to the appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar could have a more significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
to the extent that we incur expenses that are based on locally denominated sales volumes paid in local currency  the exposure to foreign exchange risk is reduced 
since our foreign operations are conducted using a foreign currency  we bear additional risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with regard to instruments denominated in a foreign currency  given the amount and short term maturity of these instruments 
the carrying values of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency  including cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of the short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
we have determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
therefore  we have not entered into any arrangements that involve derivative financial instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
as we continue to expand globally  the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may increase 
therefore  in the future  we will continue to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures on an ongoing basis to mitigate such risks
