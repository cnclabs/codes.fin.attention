item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations net income for the year ended december  increased  or  to  this increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income  which increased to million as interest rates began to rise during the last half of the year 
total interest income increased million  or  as the company s average interest earning assets  primarily loans and investment securities  increased by million or from december  interest expense increased to million from million in this increase is reflective of a increase in average interest bearing deposits as well as a full year of expense related to the million trust preferred securities issued in december other income decreased in as mortgage loan refinancing slowed resulting in a  or  decrease in secondary mortgage market loan income 
also decreasing in compared to were deposit fees and charges  income from the investment in bank owned life insurance  and commissions from the sale of non deposit investment products 
non interest expenses increased primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits  in addition  other areas contributing to the increase were occupancy expense  advertising  and office supplies principally due to the opening of the bellgrade branch in march for the year ended december   net income increased  or  to  the major source of this increase was net interest income  which increased to million due to the steady  but lower  interest rate environment throughout the year 
total interest income increased million  or  as the company s interest earning assets  most notably loans and investment securities  rose from december  funding for this asset growth was provided by a million  or  increase in deposits  as well as a million increase in federal home loan bank advances and million in proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities 
also showing an increase for the year was other income  which rose reflecting increased activity in the secondary mortgage market loan area as well as in co mmissions from the sales of non deposit investment products

non interest income 
non interest income decreased  or  in from for various reasons 
deposit fees and charges were down as fees charged on overdrawn checking accounts declined 
the increase in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance declined  reflecting decreases in interest rates 
a downturn in mortgage loan refinancing activity resulted in a decline of in income and fees from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
commissions earned from the sales of non deposit investment products decreased in spite of an increase in overall activity as the results included one large non recurring commission 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in bank card fees  a increase in gains realized on the sale of securities and a increase in other income 
during  increased mortgage loan refinancing activity resulted in a increase in secondary mortgage market fees for the year compared to in addition  the efforts of the company s investment personnel resulted in an increase in investment and insurance commissions of  or over these increases along with an increase in gains on sales of securities helped offset a small decrease in deposit fees and charges as total non interest income increased  or for the year 
non interest expenses 
total non interest expenses increased  or for the year ended december  increases in salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  equipment depreciation  advertising  and office supplies were all impacted by the addition of the bellgrade branch in march employee benefit expense  up  also reflected a general increase in the cost of group insurance coverage 
the increase in occupancy expense also reflected the costs of building repairs necessitated by weather related damage as well as routine maintenance such as painting 
taxes and license expense  which increased  reflects the additional state taxes paid on the capital of the bank after the addition of the million capital contribution from the company in december for the year ended december   a modest decrease of  or  in legal and professional fees was the only category of non interest expenses not to show an increase 
however  the overall increase in non interest expenses for the year of  or  was not unexpected given the growth of the company 
the largest dollar and percentage increases occurred in the salary and benefits categories as the company added lending staff in the middle of as well as other staff necessary to support the growth of the company

salaries and benefits combined rose  or 
this also represented of the total increase in non interest expenses for the year 
income taxes 
the company reported income taxes of  in  compared to  in and  in these amounts yielded effective tax rates of   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was positively impacted by increased investments in various securities where a significant amount of the dividends received were not subject to income taxes and the recognition of certain annual tax credits resulting from the company s investment in a community reinvestment act eligible housing project in december financial condition loan portfolio 
the company is an active residential mortgage and residential construction lender and generally extends commercial loans to small and medium sized businesses within its primary service area 
the company s commercial lending activity extends across its primary service area of powhatan  cumberland  western chesterfield  and western henrico counties 
consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  the company generally does not attempt to diversify its loan portfolio geographically by making significant amounts of loans to borrowers outside of its primary service area 
the principal economic risk associated with each of the categories of loans in the company s portfolio is the creditworthiness of its borrowers 
within each category  such risk is increased or decreased depending on prevailing economic conditions 
the risk associated with the real estate mortgage loans and installment loans to individuals varies based upon employment levels  consumer confidence  fluctuations in value of residential real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of consumers to repay indebtedness 
the risk associated with commercial  financial and agricultural loans varies based upon the strength and activity of the local economies of the company s market areas 
the risk associated with real estate construction loans varies based upon the supply of and demand for the type of real estate under construction 
many of the company s real estate construction loans are for pre sold or contract homes 
builders are limited as to the number and dollar amount of loans for speculative home construction based on the financial strength of the borrower and the prevailing market conditions

non performing loans include non accrual loans  loans days or more past due and restructured loans 
non accrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been discontinued 
loans which reach non accrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and interest has been paid  or the loan becomes both well secured and in the process of collection 
restructured loans are loans with respect to which a borrower has been granted a concession on the interest rate or the original repayment terms because of financial difficulties 
non performing loans totaled  at december   compared to  at december  and  at december  non performing loans decreased in primarily due to a decline in loans past due days or more from million in to  in the higher level of non performing loans in both and is reflective of an increase in loans days past due and still accruing interest 
there were  in loans classified as non accrual at december  compared to none at december  and  at december  the majority of these loans are well secured by real estate and no significant losses are anticipated regardless of the resolution 
other non performing assets consist of a virginia small business financing authority industrial development revenue bond where the underlying business  in  defaulted on its interest payments 
the trustee  in accordance with the terms of the indenture  subsequently foreclosed on the underlying real estate collateral securing the bond and the property was listed for sale 
the security was initially placed in non accrual status  but is currently classified as a component of other assets at a value approximating its anticipated liquidation value 
the property is presently leased to a tenant who has a multi year lease purchase option on the property 
the original principal investment was  and has been written down to a value of  rental payments from the lessee were received in totaling  that was applied to reduce the carrying value to its present balance of  management anticipates future lease payments will be received and applied t o further reduce the principal carrying value  accordingly  there are no additional write downs contemplated 
management forecloses on delinquent real estate loans when all other repayment possibilities have been exhausted 
there was no real estate acquired through foreclosure oreo at december  compared to  at both december  and sales of the properties held at december  resulted in net losses of approximately  the bank has incurred current period expenses related to carrying oreo on its books of in   in  and  in the bank s practice is to value real estate acquired through foreclosure at the lower of i an independent current appraisal or market analysis less anticipated costs of disposal  or ii the existing loan balance 
management does not believe that the level of non performing loans in reflects any systemic problem in the company s loan portfolio 
at december   there were  in non accrual loans compared to none at december  and  at december  based on our present knowledge of the status of individual and corporate creditors and the overall economy  management does not anticipate a material increase in non performing assets  although it may move to foreclose on borrowers whose loans are placed on a non accrual status 
the following table summarizes non performing assets at december  dollars in thousand loans accounted for on a non accrual basis loans contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments not included in non accrual loans above loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms not included in non accrual loans or loans contractually past due days or more above total non performing loans other real estate owned other non performing assets total non performing assets loans days or more past due are placed on non accrual status unless well secured and in the process of collection

since the company operates in a rural to suburban area  it has generally been well acquainted with its principal borrowers and has not had such a large number of problem credits that management has not been able to stay well informed about  and in contact with  troubled borrowers 
additionally  because the company generally requires collateral for loans  the company has been able to recover a sufficient amount of loans previously charged off so that the provision for loan losses each year usually exceeds net charge offs 
the following table sets forth the amounts of contracted interest income and interest income reflected in income on loans accounted for on a non accrual basis and loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms for the year ended december  dollars in thousands gross interest income that would have been recorded if the loans had been current and in accordance with their original terms interest income included in income on the loans management is not aware of any other loans at december   which involve serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the existing payment terms 
management has analyzed the potential risk of loss within the company s loan portfolio  given the loan balances  quality trends  value of the underlying collateral  and current local market economic and business conditions and has recognized losses where appropriate 
loans  including non performing loans are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the company s periodic loan review process 
management reviews the adequacy of its loan loss allowance at the end of each month 
based primarily on the company s loan risk classification system  which classifies all loans  including problem credits as substandard  doubtful  or loss  according to a scale of with being a loss  additional provisions for losses may be made monthly 
management evaluates non performing loans relative to their collateral value and makes appropriate reductions in the carrying value of those loans based on that review 
furthermore  past experiences had led management to conclude that as a general matter it is prudent to operate with a high level of reserves 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at december   compared to at december  and at december  management feels that the growth of the allowance for loan losses  while not at the same rate as the portfolio growth  is adequate to provide for future losses 
at december   the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
management evaluates non performing loans relative to their collateral value and makes appropriate reductions in the carrying value of those loans based on that review

management evaluates the loan portfolio in light of local business and economic conditions  changes in the nature and value of the portfolio  industry standards and other relevant factors 
assumptions and factors considered by management in determining the amounts charged to operations include internally generated loan review reports  previous loan loss experience with the borrower  the status of past due interest and principal payments on the loan  the quality of financial information supplied by the borrower and the general financial condition of the borrower 
despite management s best efforts  the reserve may be adjusted in future periods if there are significant changes in the assumptions or factors utilized when making valuations  or conditions differ materially from the assumptions originally utilized 
any such adjustments are made in the reporting period when the relevant factor s become known and when applied as part of the analysis indicate a change in the level of potential loss is warranted 
the provision for loan losses totaled  for the year ended december    and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the opinion of management  the provision charged to operations has been sufficient to absorb the current year s net loan losses while continuing to provide for potential future loan losses in view of a somewhat uncertain economy 
the following table shows the balance and percentage of the company s allowance for loan losses allocated to each category of loans at december  percentage percentage percentage percentage of loans percentage of loans percentage of loans reserve of reserve category reserve of reserve category reserve of reserve category for loan for loan to total for loan for loan of total for loan for loan of total losses losses loans losses losses loans losses losses loans dollars in thousands commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage installment at december  percentage percentage percentage of loans percentage of loans reserve of reserve category reserve of reserve category for loan for loan to total for loan for loan of total losses losses loans losses losses loans dollars in thousands commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage installment includes home equity loans

the company has allocated the allowance according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within each of the above categories of loans 
the allocation of the allowance as shown in the table above should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions or that the allocation indicates future loss trends 
furthermore  the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire portfolio 
securities the company s investment securities portfolio serves several purposes  primarily  liquidity  safety and yield 
certain of the securities are pledged to secure public deposits and others are specifically identified as collateral for repurchase agreements with customers 
the remaining portion of the portfolio is held for investment yield  availability for sale in the event liquidity is needed and for general asset liability management purposes 
during  total securities decreased million  or  to million  or of total assets  principally due to the million  or  increase in loans 
in prior years  the company had consciously increased its marketable securities holdings supported by deposit growth and borrowings  in light of weak loan demand and growth  and the historically low interest rate environment  to increase net interest income 
during the prior year  total securities increased by to million  or of total assets 
the securities portfolio consists of two components  securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 
securities are classified as held to maturity when management has the intent and the company has the ability at the time of purchase to hold the securities to maturity 
securities so classified are carried at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
securities to be held for indefinite periods of time are classified as available for sale and accounted for at market value 
securities available for sale include securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs and other similar factors 
the company s recent purchases of securities have generally been limited to securities of investment grade credit quality with short to intermediate term maturities

deposits and short term borrowings the company s predominate source of funds is deposit accounts 
the company s deposit base is comprised of demand deposits  savings and money market accounts and other time deposits 
the company s deposits are provided by individuals and businesses generally located within the principal markets served 
as shown in the following table  average total deposits grew by in and in the average aggregate interest rate paid on deposits was in  compared to in and in the majority of the company s deposits are higher yielding time deposits because many of its customers are individuals who seek higher yields than those offered on savings and demand accounts

the company seeks to maintain a strong capital base to support its growth and expansion activities  to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence 
the bank s capital position continues to exceed regulatory requirements 
the primary indicators relied on by the federal reserve board and other bank regulators in measuring strength of capital position are the tier capital  total capital  and leverage ratios 
tier capital consists of common and qualifying preferred stockholders equity and minority interests in common equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
total capital consists of tier capital  qualifying subordinated debt  some hybrid capital instruments and other qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses and pre tax net unrealized holding gains on certain equity securities 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets  which consist of both on and off balance sheet risks 
the bank s tier capital ratio was at december   compared to at december  and at december  the total capital ratio was at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
these ratios are in excess of the mandated minimum requirements of and  respectively 
the leverage ratio consists of tier capital divided by quarterly average assets 
at december   the bank s leverage ratio was compared to at december  and at december  each of these exceeds the required minimum leverage ratio of 
the company  in view of the significant growth experienced over the past several years and the resulting impact on various capital ratios  recognized the eventual need for additional capital to support further expansion or acquisitions and used the proceeds from the issuance of the million capital trust preferred securities in december to increase the capital position of the bank 
the following tables show risk based capital ratios and stockholders equity to total assets for the company and the bank december  regulatory minimum consolidated tier risk based capital total risk based capital leverage ratio stockholders equity to total assets n a central virginia bank tier risk based capital total risk based capital leverage ratio the capital management function is an ongoing process 
central to this process is internal equity generation accomplished by earnings retention 
total stockholders equity increased by million in primarily due to earnings retention  and by million during primarily as the result of earnings retention and improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the return on average equity was in  compared to in and in total cash dividends were paid representing of net income for  while dividends represented of net income for and for book value per share was at december   compared to at december  and at december  the company s principal source of cash income is dividend payments from the bank 
certain limitations exist under applicable law and regulation by regulatory agencies regarding dividend payments to a parent by its subsidiaries 
as of december   the bank had million of retained earnings available for distribution to the company as dividends without prior regulatory approval 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity 
liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing within one year 
the company s ability to obtain deposits and purchase funds at favorable rates determines its liability liquidity 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets and its ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
additional sources of liquidity available to the company include  but are not limited to  loan repayments  the ability to obtain deposits through the adjustment of interest rates  borrowing from the federal home loan bank  purchasing of federal funds  and selling securities under repurchase agreements 
to further meet its liquidity needs  the company also has access to the federal reserve system 
in the past  growth in deposits and proceeds from the maturity of investment securities has been sufficient to fund the net increase in loans 
the bank  over the past three years  has experienced growth in deposits 
during the same period  notwithstanding the million long term capital trust preferred issue in december  the bank has increased its borrowings from million at the beginning of to million at the end of in view of the historically low interest rate environment  coupled with the opportunity to lengthen maturities  the bank has been able to lock in low rate cost of funds for up to five years 
these funds have been deployed at favorable yields in the investment portfolio  and more recently as funding for loan growth 
interest rate sensitivity 
in conjunction with maintaining a satisfactory level of liquidity  management must also control the degree of interest rate risk assumed on the balance sheet 
managing this risk involves regular monitoring of the interest sensitive assets relative to interest sensitive liabilities over specific time intervals 
at december   the company had a negative month gap position 
since the largest amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities reprice within months  the company monitors this area closely 
the company does not emphasize interest sensitivity analysis beyond this time frame because it believes various unpredictable factors could result in erroneous interpretations 
early withdrawal of deposits  prepayments of loans and loan delinquencies are some of the factors that could have such an effect 
in addition  changes in rates on interest sensitive assets and liabilities may not be equal  which could result in a change in net interest margin 
while the company does not match each of its interest sensitive assets against specific interest sensitive liabilities  it does seek to enhance the net interest margin while minimizing exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
effects of inflation inflation significantly affects industries having high proportions of fixed assets or high levels of inventories 
although the company is not significantly affected in these areas  inflation does have an impact on the growth of assets 
as assets grow rapidly  it becomes necessary to increase equity capital at proportionate levels to maintain the appropriate equity to asset ratios 
traditionally  the company s earnings and high capital retention levels have enabled the company to meet these needs 
the company s reported earnings results have been affected by inflation  but isolating the effect is difficult 
the different types of income and expense are affected in various ways 
interest rates are affected by inflation  but the timing and magnitude of the changes may not coincide with changes in the consumer price index 
management actively monitors interest rate sensitivity  as illustrated by the gap analysis  in order to minimize the effects of inflationary trends on interest rates 
other areas of non interest expenses may be more directly affected by inflation

off balance sheet arrangements the company enters into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit which would impact the company s liquidity and capital resources to the extent customer s accept and or use these commitments 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the nature  business purpose and elements of risk involved with these off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition to these off balance sheet arrangements  the company has entered into an interest rate swap contract in connection with its capital trust preferred securities 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources  that is material to investors

critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
a summary of the significant accounting policies of the company is set forth in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general an important element of both earnings performance and liquidity is the management of our interest sensitive assets and our interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within specific time intervals and the risks involved with them 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the asset and liability management committee at the bank is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk 
our board of directors reviews the guidelines established by the committee 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complimentary modeling tools static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and economic value simulation net present value estimation 
each of these models measures changes in a variety of interest rate scenarios 
while each of the interest rate risk measures has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap  which measures aggregate repricing values  is less utilized since it does not effectively measure the earnings impact on us 
earnings simulation and economic value models  however  which more effectively reflect the earnings impact  are utilized by management on a regular basis 
earnings simulation analysis we use simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net income to changes in interest rates 
the model utilized calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process  but it provides a more realistic analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analysis such as the static gap analysis 
assumptions used in the model  including loan and deposit growth rates  are derived from seasonal trends and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project the yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are accounted for in the different rate scenarios 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity of our net income on a month horizon using different rate scenarios as of december  there have been no material changes in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since this information was developed using december  data 
change in yield curve change in net income change in net income dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points economic value simulation we use economic value simulation to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities under different interest rate environments 
economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis 
the economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities 
the change in economic value of equity over different rate environments is an indication of the longer term repricing risk in the balance sheet 
the same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation 
the following chart reflects the change in net market value of equity by using december  data  over different rate environments with a one year horizon 
change in yield curve change in economic value of equity change in economic value of equity dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points management of the interest sensitivity gap the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time interval 
the gap can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  by selling investments  by replacing an asset or liability prior to maturity  or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
matching the amounts of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net income due to changes in market interest rates 
we evaluate interest rate risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments in order to decrease sensitivity risk 
these guidelines are based upon management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and nat ional economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
our asset and liability committee reviews deposit pricing  changes in borrowed money  investment and trading activity  loan sale activities  liquidity levels and the overall interest sensitivity 
the actions of the committee are reported to the board of directors regularly 
the periodic monitoring of interest rate risk  investment and trading activity  along with any other significant transactions are managed by the chief executive officer of the bank with input from other committee members
