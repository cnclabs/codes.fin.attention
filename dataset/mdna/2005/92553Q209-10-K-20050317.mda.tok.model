item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations comparison of results for the year ended january  to the year ended january  revenues revenues decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was due to lower sales of million in neurocare and million in critical care  partially offset by increases of million in medical and surgical products and million in respiratory technologies 
the decrease was driven primarily by lower sales of our older products in neurocare  while critical care experienced lower international sales in as a result of unusually high sales in due to the sars epidemic and million of government tenders 
these decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of million as well as increased sales in our orthopedics business and enteral feeding tube product lines 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of revenues increased million to million in from million in gross margin decreased million to million in from million in gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased percentage points to in from in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower sales  a non recurring high margin sale to a foreign government agency in the first quarter of  higher warranty costs and inventory write offs partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of million 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the following factors higher expenses related to the expansion of our field sales  service and marketing organizations  million from the impact of foreign currency translation  compliance costs associated with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  and higher legal expenses related to defending our intellectual property and the litigation involving the commercialization of nitric oxide gas 
partially offsetting these increases were savings related to the restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of and lower incentive compensation 
research and development expense research and development expense decreased million to million in from million in this decrease is largely attributable to the continued streamlining and refocusing of the company s research and development programs as well as the movement of several projects out of research and development into commercialization partially offset by new development projects 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million in  compared to million in in the third quarter of  we initiated a company wide restructuring plan to lower our cost structure 
the principal components of the plan include reducing worldwide headcount by approximately employees  transitioning the respiratory technologies us manufacturing operations from yorba linda  california to our critical care facility in palm springs  california  combining critical care s us commercial operations with respiratory technologies us commercial operations in a newly leased facility in yorba linda  california  and the closure of a facility in bilthoven  the netherlands 
the plan involves the termination of employees in germany  the netherlands  the united kingdom and the united states 
the total amount of restructuring expense expected to be incurred in connection with this plan is between million and million 
in  we recorded a restructuring charge relating to this plan of approximately million  including million for severance  million for employee retention and million for other costs 
as of january   of the targeted employees had been severed and million of severance had been paid 
we expect all components of the plan to be substantially completed by the end of we estimate that as a result of this plan we will achieve annual operating expense savings of approximately million in fiscal in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a plan to close a machine shop and reduce the number of customer service positions at a respiratory technologies facility in germany 
due to german labor regulations  certain positions cannot be eliminated immediately 
as a result of this plan  positions are being eliminated over a period of five years 
as of january   of these positions had been eliminated 
severance expense for the remaining employees will continue to be recorded ratably over their remaining employment term 
the total amount of restructuring expense expected to be incurred in connection with this plan is approximately million 
as of january   a total of million of expense had been incurred related to this plan  of which million was recognized in once this plan is complete  the annual savings from this plan are expected to total approximately million  which will be realized over the next four years as the positions are eliminated 
on august   we commenced a plan to restructure our neurocare segment 
the restructuring plan included the termination of general and administrative  service and manufacturing positions 
the plan was carried out in the third and fourth quarters of the total amount of restructuring expense incurred in connection with this plan was approximately million  all of which was expensed and paid in beginning in  this plan resulted in annual cost savings of approximately million  much of which was reinvested into other areas in neurocare  such as sales and research and development 
in  as a result of the acquisition of eme  the company initiated a restructuring plan related to its critical care segment  which resulted in the elimination of positions in the areas of sales  finance  service and research and development 
the total amount of restructuring expense incurred in connection with this plan was approximately million  most of which was expensed and paid in beginning in  this plan resulted in annual cost savings of approximately million 
purchased in process research and development during  we recorded a million non recurring charge to write off in process research and development costs attributed to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of taugagreining 
there were no in process research and development charges incurred in legal settlement in the second quarter of  we settled the litigation with ino therapeutics  llc ino therapeutics  aga ab  and the general hospital corporation regarding the use and sale of nitric oxide gas and devices and received a payment of million in connection with the dismissal of the litigation 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in the effective tax rate in was more than the statutory federal income tax rate of primarily because of the impact of state income taxes  lower tax rates on net foreign losses and purchased in process research and development charges that are not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate impact of nondeductible purchased in process research and development was an increase of percentage points 
these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by the tax benefit attributable to us export sales 
the effective tax rate in was less than the statutory federal income tax rate of primarily because of the tax benefit attributable to us export sales and us research and development tax credits 
discontinued operations the net loss from discontinued operations was million in  compared to million in in  we sold medical data electronics mde and our thermedics polymer business thermedics

segment information respiratory technologies revenues increased million to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of million  an increase in service revenue of million including million received from ino therapeutics based on our submission of a research and development plan in connection with a co development agreement in the pulmonary infection inflammation field 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues in our clinical services business due to delays in the initiation of several clinical trials and lower domestic sales of sleep therapy systems due to a legal dispute  which was settled favorably in early operating income decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was mainly due to the following costs of million related to the restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of  increases in selling  general and administration expense  lower gross margin attributable to a change in product mix caused by the reduced revenues in our clinical services business  and costs related to the german restructuring plan initiated in the fourth quarter of of million in compared to million in selling  general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the establishment of the infrastructure of our clinical services business  higher expenses related to the expansion of our field sales and service organizations  and higher legal expenses incurred to defend certain intellectual property 
these reductions in operating income were partially offset by the million legal settlement from ino therapeutics received in the second quarter of and a reduction in incentive pay 
critical care revenues decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower international sales as a result of million of government tenders in and sales of million related to the sars epidemic in partially offset by increased sales of the new avea and vela ventilators and an increase in service revenue of million

we had an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million in this decrease was primarily due to the following lower sales volume and pricing pressures on older product lines  both of which reduced gross margin  higher selling  general and administrative expense primarily related to higher legal and international operating expenses  higher amortization expense related to our recent acquisition of the audioscreener hearing screening device  costs of million related to the restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of  inventory write offs of obsolete inventory related to discontinued products  and the write off of purchased in process research and development costs in the fourth quarter of related to the acquisition of taugagreining 
offsetting these decreases was a reduction in research and development expense related to the movement of several projects out of research and development into commercialization and costs in of million related to the neurocare restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of medical and surgical products revenues increased million to million in from million in this increase was primarily driven by increased sales in our orthopedic business as well as higher sales of our enteral feeding tube product line 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of our medical imaging products 
operating income increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased gross margin resulting from the higher sales as well as manufacturing efficiencies and lower research and development expense 
these increases were partially offset by higher expenses mainly to expand our medical disposables sales force to pursue opportunities in targeted markets and costs of million related to the restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of comparison of results for the year ended january  to the year ended december  revenues revenues increased million to million in from million in of this increase  million was contributed by respiratory technologies  million by critical care and million by medical and surgical products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in neurocare 
the revenue increase resulted primarily from million in sales of new products  principally in the critical care segment 
our clinical services business contributed million of increased revenue  while the weakening of the dollar against the euro contributed million 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in sales in our base business primarily due to the replacement of mature products by new products 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of revenues increased million to million in from million in gross margin percentage decreased percentage points to in from in this decrease was due to several factors  including reengineering costs related to avea 
in addition  market conditions in lead to the write off of inventory we acquired as a result of the spin off from our former parent company 
also contributing to the decrease were increased sales of lower margin products and higher installation and warranty expense 
partially offsetting the decreases in gross margin percentage were increased sales of new higher margin products 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was in compared with in the increase was due to negative currency impacts as a result of the weakening of the dollar against the euro  incremental investment in neurocare s sales force and marketing  higher incentive compensation and increased legal expenses  mainly due to the litigation with ino therapeutics 
selling  general and administrative expenses also increased due to the inclusion of a full year of expenses for eme and scimed limited scimed  which were companies acquired in the fourth quarter of research and development expense research and development expense was million in both and as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense was in compared with in restructuring charges we incurred million and million of restructuring costs in and  respectively

the restructuring plan in neurocare included the termination of employees from general and administrative  service and manufacturing 
the plan was carried out in the third and fourth quarters of and severance of million was expensed and paid 
beginning in  this plan resulted in annual cost savings of approximately million  much of which was reinvested into more productive areas in neurocare  such as sales and research and development

provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in the effective tax rate in was less than the statutory federal income tax rate of primarily because of the tax benefit attributable to us export sales and us research and development tax credits 
these benefits were partially offset by the impact of state income taxes 
the effective tax rate in exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate of primarily because of the impact of state income taxes and the nondeductible purchased in process research and development associated with our acquisition of eme  partially offset by the tax benefit attributable to us export sales 
the impact of nondeductible purchased in process research and development on our effective tax rate was percentage points

critical care revenues increased million to million in from million in the increase resulted from the sale of new products  including avea  vela and infant flow  which totaled million 
in addition  increased sales of our earlier model t bird ventilators to asia in the second quarter due to the sars outbreak contributed million to the increase 
partially offsetting these increases were lower volume and pricing pressures on some of our mature product lines 
operating income more than doubled due to the increased volume 
neurocare revenues decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was a result of lower sales of our emg and eeg products  partially offset by increased sales of our audiology and peripheral vascular products 
operating income increased million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to a reduction in restructuring and research and development expenses as well as savings from efficiencies obtained from our restructuring efforts 
partially offsetting these increases were lower gross margin due to the revenue decrease and higher expenses as a result of our incremental investment in the sales and marketing force 
medical and surgical products revenues increased million to million in from million in this increase is a result of higher sales in our medical disposable and orthopedic implant businesses 
partially offsetting these increases were decreased sales of our medical imaging and heart device components

liquidity and capital resources as of january  and january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
at january   approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents was held internationally and may be subject to us income tax if repatriated to the us our working capital was approximately million and million at january  and january   respectively 
on january   we acquired substantially all of the assets of navion biomedical corporation for a cash purchase price of million  of which million will be paid in the first quarter of on march   we acquired the global medical business of oxford instruments plc for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of micro medical for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the purchase price consisted of approximately million in cash net of cash acquired and approximately million in assumed debt 
our cash flow from operations decreased by million to million in from million in cash flow from operations increased by million to million in from million in cash flows from our operating activities are generally the result of net income  deferred taxes  depreciation and amortization and changes in our working capital 
net income from continuing operations adjusted to exclude certain non cash items  such as depreciation and amortization  was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the overall impact of changes in certain operating assets and liabilities on total operating cash flows resulted in net cash inflows of million and million in and  respectively  and a use of cash of million in discontinued operations used cash of million and million in and  respectively  and provided cash of million in we used net cash from investing activities of continuing operations of million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively

during  we received proceeds from the sale of intangible assets of million 
during  we paid million to acquire substantially all of the assets of taugagreining 
during  we made additional payments of million related to the acquisitions of eme and scimed 
during  we paid million to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of eme and scimed 
discontinued operations provided cash of million in compared to used cash of million in we generated net cash from financing activities of million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in  we received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in  we received million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  compared to million in fiscal in june  we issued  shares of common stock in a follow on public offering 
the net proceeds generated by the offering  after expenses  were million 
in july  we utilized a portion of these proceeds to repay the full amount outstanding under our credit facility 
at january   we had a million revolving credit facility the facility with a syndicate of six banks  of which million was available to be borrowed 
up to million of the million is available for standby letters of credit 
under the facility  there are options under which we can borrow funds that determine the interest rate charged 
these options include borrowings at the london interbank borrowing rate libor plus a spread or at the prime rate plus a spread 
under the libor option  the interest rate depends on the term selected which can be no more than one year  and is fixed for that term 
under the prime rate option  the interest rate fluctuates based on the prime rate during the period which any amount is outstanding under that option 
we repaid the full amount outstanding under the facility in july no amounts were outstanding under the facility as of january  the facility will expire on may  we are currently in the process of obtaining a new credit facility and anticipate that a new facility will be in place on or before the expiration date of the current facility 
the amount and other terms of the new credit facility have not yet been finalized 
while we anticipate that we will be able to obtain a new credit facility and that the terms of such facility will be at least as favorable as the current facility  there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain a new credit facility or that the terms will be attractive to us in financing our business plans 
our ability to access the current facility or a new credit facility will depend on complying with the debt covenants that are part of those agreements 
the covenants of our facility include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization ebitda of  a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of  maximum annual capital expenditures of million and a minimum level of stockholders equity 
we expect the new debt covenants to be similar in nature but anticipate that changes  such as the maximum capital expenditure limit  will be made in order to consider our needs over the term of the new credit facility 
while we are in compliance with the debt covenants of our facility and expect to be able to meet the requirements of the facility through the expiration date and the requirements of any new credit facility in the future  failure to satisfy any of the conditions would require us to renegotiate either credit facility on terms that may not be as favorable or could require us to repay any outstanding balance 
while we would attempt to find alternative sources to fund our operations from other financial institutions  we cannot assure you that we would be successful  or if we were successful  that the new credit facility would be on terms that would be attractive to us in financing our business plans 
our overall capital expenditures in are expected to approximate million 
this amount excludes potential capital expenditures related to the companies we acquired in beyond the next twelve months  our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our sales growth  market acceptance of our new products  research and development spending  the success of our product development efforts  capital spending policies of our customers  government spending policies and general economic conditions 
in  we initiated a company wide restructuring plan to lower our cost structure 
we expect this action to bring expenses in line with the growth in our core businesses and enhance our near and long term profitability 
as a result of this initiative  we expect to incur a total pre tax restructuring charge of million to million  of which million has been recognized and million has been paid in we expect this initiative to be substantially completed by the end of and the remaining amounts to be recognized and paid in our principal source of liquidity at january  consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  plus million available under the facility 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations and cash available under the facility will be sufficient to finance our operations  the acquisition of navion biomedical corporation  oxford medical and micro medical and capital expenditure requirements and commitments for the foreseeable future 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance unforeseen requirements or to acquire other businesses  products or technologies 
these funds may be obtained through the sale of equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to us  or at all 
if funds are raised by issuing additional equity securities or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentage of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  equity or debt securities issued by us may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the following table summarizes our commercial commitments at january  in millions amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year years years more than years standby letters of credit total commercial commitments off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each period 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
we believe that the following critical accounting estimates affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of products and to a lesser extent the provision of services and rental equipment 
where installation either is essential to product functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  such as equipment sales under contracts that require us to install the product at the customer location  revenue is recognized when the equipment has been delivered to and installed at the customer location 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  such as revenue from customer installable products  is recognized upon transfer of title with estimated installation costs accrued 
our service revenues are derived from parts  service contracts  training  repairs not under warranty and research and development for third parties 
we sell service contracts on our products when the warranty period expires 
we recognize revenues from these service contracts ratably over the terms of the contracts due to the lack of historical data available regarding the timing of when the actual services were provided 
in the future  we may compile this information which could cause us to recognize service revenue over a different period 
we recognize revenues from the sale of spare parts upon transfer of title 
we recognize revenues from training and repairs at the time the service is performed and the customer has accepted the work 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our historical collections experience  historical write offs of our receivables  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
our determination of net realizable value takes into account projected sales of the inventory on hand and the age of the inventory in stock 
in addition  we assess the value of older model products when new product introductions may reduce their net realizable value 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the provision for write down of inventory is recorded in cost of revenues 
goodwill impairment we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective december  sfas no 
requires companies to perform a transitional test and an annual test to determine whether there was any impairment of goodwill 
these tests involve determining the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units by measuring the net present value of their future cash flows 
if the net present value of estimated cash flows is less than the book value of the reporting unit we would perform additional analysis  which could result in the write down of goodwill 
we determined our reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill impairment under sfas no 
by evaluating our four operating segments respiratory technologies  critical care  neurocare and medical and surgical products 
each of these operating segments is comprised of several components 
while the components of respiratory technologies  critical care and neurocare have similar economic characteristics  products and services  production processes  customers and methods of distribution  the components of the medical and surgical products segment do not 
therefore  the components have been aggregated at the operating segment level for respiratory technologies  critical care and neurocare and each of these segments was treated as a reporting unit 
since the components of medical and surgical products cannot be aggregated  each component was treated as a separate reporting unit 
as part of the impairment testing  the company allocated its goodwill to its reporting units 
goodwill from an acquisition that is specifically associated with a single reporting unit is recorded on the books of that reporting unit 
however  when goodwill from a transaction is associated with multiple reporting units it is allocated to the reporting units based upon relative revenues at the time of the acquisition 
we performed the annual test in and have determined that there is no impairment of goodwill 
in performing this test  we used our internal operating and capital budgets  which are based on such assumptions as new product introductions  growth in sales of existing products  margin improvements  operating cost control  savings from past restructuring efforts  equipment replacement dates and building capacity needs 
we discounted our estimated cash flows using our estimated cost of capital 
if any of our assumptions change  such as an increase of our cost of capital or a decrease in our forecasted operating results  it could result in an impairment of goodwill  which would require a charge to earnings 
stock based compensation stock options are granted to key employees and non employee directors 
upon vesting  an option becomes exercisable  meaning  an employee or director can purchase a share of the company s common stock at a price that is equal to the closing share price on the day of grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  permits companies either to continue accounting for stock options under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or to adopt a fair value based method to measure compensation cost 
under apb no 
 which we have elected to continue using  there is no compensation cost if  on the date of grant  the option s exercise price is equal to or greater than the share price 
under sfas no 
 an option s fair value is estimated on the date of grant  and the value is expensed evenly over the vesting period 
if we had accounted for stock based compensation under the sfas no 
fair value based method  net income would have been reduced by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in order to estimate an option s fair value under sfas no 
 we use the black scholes option valuation model 
the option valuation model requires a number of assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected option life the amount of time until the options are exercised or expire 
expected option life is based on actual exercise activity from previous option grants 
volatility is calculated based upon stock price movements over a period of time 
additionally  our share price on the day of grant influences the option value 
the higher the share price  as compared to the grant price  the more the option is worth 
changes in the option value after the day of grant are not reflected in expense 
any change in these assumptions could significantly impact the values calculated by the option valuation model and  consequently  the pro forma effects disclosed under the caption stock based compensation in note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements for information on the recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business  see discussion under the caption recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
foreign currency risk we derive approximately of our revenues from customers located outside the united states 
some of this business is transacted through our foreign subsidiaries  primarily in the local currency that is considered the functional currency of that foreign subsidiary 
expenses are also incurred in the local currencies to match revenues earned and minimize exchange rate exposure 
the company generally views its investment in its foreign subsidiaries as long term 
the effects of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
a depreciation in functional currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries of approximately million at january  interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates would result in a change in interest income 
our market risk exposure to changes in interest rates is immaterial
