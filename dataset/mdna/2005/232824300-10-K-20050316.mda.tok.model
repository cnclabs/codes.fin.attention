license and contract revenues accounted for the remainder of revenues 
if quadramet or prostascint does not achieve broader market acceptance  either because we fail to effectively market such products or our competitors introduce competing products  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable 
further  if combidex does not receive regulatory approval  we will not be permitted to sell and market combidex as we have anticipated and we will not realize any return on the significant amount of time and resources we have allocated to combidex 
prostascint 
prostascint sales were million for the year ended december   an increase of  from million for the same period of sales of prostascint accounted for and of product related revenues for and  respectively 
we believe that such increase in prostascint sales was due to increased demand associated with our focused marketing programs  a higher prostascint reimbursement value established for compared to and our identification of new 
table of contents distribution channels to better accommodate customer needs 
we believe that demand for prostascint was consistently higher during than as evidenced by the higher annual sales in prostascint has historically been a challenging product for physicians and technologists to use  in part due to inherent limitations in nuclear medicine imaging 
we believe that future growth and market penetration of prostascint is dependent upon  among other things  the implementation and continued research relating to advances in imaging technology  new product applications and the validation of psma as an independent prognostic indicator

on august   we began recognizing product revenue from our sales of quadramet 
currently  we market quadramet only in the united states and have no rights to market quadramet in europe 
we believe that the future growth and market penetration of quadramet is dependent upon  among other things i new clinical data supporting the expanded and earlier use of quadramet in various cancers  ii novel research supporting combination uses with other therapies  such as chemotherapeutics and bisphosphonates  and iii establishing the use of quadramet at higher doses to target and treat primary bone cancers

our agreement will terminate  unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms  upon laureate s completion of the production campaign and shipment of the resulting products from laureate s facility 
under the terms of the agreement  we are obligated to pay at least an aggregate of million through  of which million was incurred in we intend that the agreement will provide us with a sufficient supply of prostascint to satisfy our commercial requirements for approximately the next four years  based upon current sales levels 
in october  laureate was acquired by safeguard scientifics  inc laureate has continued to operate as a full service contract manufacturing organization and we have not experienced any disruption in laureate s performance of its obligations to produce prostascint 
in  we reacquired the marketing rights to quadramet from berlex 
accordingly  effective august   we began recording all revenue from sales of quadramet 
effective upon the reacquisition of such marketing rights  we no longer receive royalty revenue from berlex and pay berlex royalties on our sales of quadramet 
as a result of the reacquisition  we assumed all of berlex s obligations under a manufacturing and supply agreement with bmsmi 
effective january   we entered into a new manufacturing and supply agreement with bmsmi whereby bmsmi manufactures  distributes and provides order processing and customer services for us relating to quadramet 
under the terms of the new agreement  we are obligated to pay at least million annually  subject to future annual price adjustment  through  unless terminated by bmsmi or us on two years prior written notice 
for  we incurred million of manufacturing costs for quadramet 
this agreement will automatically renew for five successive one year periods unless terminated by bmsmi or us on a two year prior written notice 
we also pay bmsmi a variable amount per month for each quadramet order placed to cover the costs of customer service 
in addition  we expect our quadramet sales and marketing expenses to increase in beginning in december  we began to equally share the costs of the joint venture with progenics 
in  cytogen and progenics each provided funding of million to the joint venture 
as of march   we and progenics are in the process of negotiating the work plan and annual budget for for the joint venture 
we cannot give any assurances that agreement will be reached on such matters in the near future  if at all 
cytogen and progenics each made a capital contribution of  to the joint venture in january  for expenditures 
we may incur significant and increasing costs in the future to fund our share of the development costs from the joint venture although we cannot provide any assurance that any further agreements between us and progenics will be reached regarding the joint venture 
any funding amount in subsequent periods may vary dependent upon  among other things  the results of the clinical trials and research and development activities  competitive and technological developments  and market opportunities 
our financial objectives are to meet our capital and operating requirements through revenues from existing products and licensing arrangements 
to achieve these objectives  we may enter into research and development partnerships and acquire  in license and develop other technologies  products or services 
certain of these 
table of contents strategies may require payments by us in either cash or stock in addition to the costs associated with developing and marketing a product or technology 
however  we believe that  if successful  such strategies may increase long term revenues 
there can be no assurance as to the success of such strategies or that resulting funds will be sufficient to meet cash requirements until product revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses  if ever 
to fund these strategic and operating activities  we may sell equity  debt or other securities as market conditions permit or enter into credit facilities 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to implement our planned product development efforts  including acquisition of products and complementary technologies  research and development  clinical studies and regulatory activities  and to further our marketing and sales programs 
we expect that our existing capital resources should be adequate to fund our operations and commitments at least into early we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we expect that we will have additional requirements for debt or equity capital  irrespective of whether and when we reach profitability  for further product development costs  product and technology acquisition costs  and working capital 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including i the successful commercialization of our products  ii the costs associated with the acquisition of complementary products and technologies  iii progress in our product development efforts and the magnitude and scope of such efforts  iv progress with clinical trials  v progress with regulatory affairs activities  vi the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  vii competing technological and market developments  and viii the expansion of strategic alliances for the sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of our products 
to the extent that the currently available funds and revenues are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
there can be no assurance that the financial sources described above will be available when needed or at terms commercially acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  further scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition product related revenues include product sales by us to our customers and quadramet royalties earned by us prior to august product sales are recognized when the customer takes ownership of the products and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists and the sales price is fixed and determinable 
product returns are accepted under limited circumstances and are estimated based upon historical experience 
we may provide rebates and volume discounts to our customers from time to time 
such rebates and discounts are recorded as a reduction of product sales when earned by the customer 

table of contents prior to the reacquisition of quadramet from our marketing partner berlex laboratories in august  we recognized royalty revenue on quadramet sales made by berlex  during each period as berlex sold the product 
as a result of the reacquisition  effective august  we began recognizing revenue from the sales of quadramet and no longer receive quadramet royalty revenue 
license and contract revenues include milestone payments and fees under collaborative agreements with third parties  revenues from research services  and revenues from other miscellaneous sources 
in  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab replaced staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which the company adopted in the provisions related to non refundable  up front license fees were unchanged in sab compared to sab accordingly  we defer up front license fees and recognize them over the estimated performance period of the related agreement  when we have continuing involvement 
since the term of the performance periods is subject to management s estimates  future revenues to be recognized could be affected by changes in such estimates 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust our allowance for uncollectible accounts if the future bad debt expense exceeds our estimated reserve 
we are subject to concentration risks as a limited number of our customers provide a high percent of total revenues  and corresponding receivables 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  as determined using the first in  first out method  which most closely reflects the physical flow of our inventories 
our products and raw materials are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly review quantities on hand to determine the need for reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of product sales 
our estimate of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
carrying value of fixed and intangible assets our fixed assets and certain of our acquired rights to market our products have been recorded at cost and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
adverse changes regarding future cash flows to be received from long lived assets could indicate that an impairment exists  and would require the write down of the carrying value of the impaired asset at that time 
new accounting pronouncements abnormal inventory costs in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no

table of contents should be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas in our fiscal year beginning january  we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this statement

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires that companies recognize compensation expense associated with grants of stock options and other equity instruments to employees in the financial statements effective as of the first interim reporting period that begins after june  compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instrument on the grant date and will be recognized over the vesting period 
this pronouncement applies to all grants after the effective date and to the unvested portion of stock options outstanding as of the effective date 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for such transactions using the intrinsic method currently used by us 
sfas no 
r also requires that companies recognize compensation expense associated with purchases of shares of common stock by employees at a discount to market value under employee stock purchase plans that meet certain criteria 
accordingly  we will adopt sfas no 
r in the quarterly period beginning july  although management has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of this standard  it is expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations 
our exposure to market risk is principally confined to interest rate sensitivity 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are conservative in nature  with a focus on preservation of capital 
due to the short term nature of our investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments are not material to our business 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 
we do not have exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates  as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding 
however  downward changes in interest rates could expose us to market risk associated with any fixed interest rate debt
