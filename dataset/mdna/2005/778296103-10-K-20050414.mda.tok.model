item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of consolidated financial statements on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their treatment under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
in response to this letter  the company initiated a review of its lease related accounting and determined that the company s method of accounting for landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases tenant improvement allowances and the company s method of accounting for rent holidays were not consistent with this guidance 
the company historically accounted for tenant improvement allowances as reductions of fixed assets on the consolidated balance sheets and as reductions of capital expenditures in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the company historically amortized leasehold improvements over the original lease term  typically years 
the company determined that the appropriate interpretation of financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  requires these allowances to be recorded as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  amortized over the lease term  and included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the company historically amortized rent holiday periods on a straight line basis over the lease term based on the store opening date  which excluded the build out period for its stores from the term over which it expensed rent 
the company considered fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  and determined that the lease term should commence on the date the company takes possession of the leased space for construction purposes  which is generally one to four months prior to the opening date 
in addition  the company historically capitalized rent during the construction period for its distribution and headquarter facilities 
the company considered interpretive guidance based on analogies to fasb statement no 
 capitalization of interest cost  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for the costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects regarding capitalization of rent during the period of time a lessee is performing construction activities 
the company concluded that its historical policy of capitalizing rent during the build out period is appropriate and has corrected its accounting to apply the policy to the build out period for all facilities  including its stores 
as a result  the company restated the consolidated financial statements for its fiscal years and the corrections are summarized in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in this report at part ii  item the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these restatement adjustments

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts

included in the carrying value of the company s merchandise inventory is a provision for shrinkage

the company opened these initial stores at locations in california during the second half of this new business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of ross  but features a different mix of brands  consisting mostly of moderate department store and discount store labels at lower average price points 
the average dd s discounts sm store is approximately  gross square feet and is located in an established strip shopping center in densely populated urban and suburban neighborhoods 
the dd s discounts sm and ross merchant  store and distribution organizations are separate and distinct  however  dd s discounts sm shares other certain corporate and support services with ross 
forward looking statements and risk factors affecting future performance this report includes certain forward looking statements regarding planned new store growth and expected sales and earnings levels  which reflect the company s current beliefs  projections and estimates with respect to future events and the company s future financial performance  operations and competitive position 
the words expect  anticipate  estimate  believe  looking ahead  forecast  guidance  plan  projected  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
risks and uncertainties that apply to both ross and dd s discounts sm stores include  without limitation  the company s ability to effectively operate and integrate various new supply chain and core merchandising systems  including generation of all necessary information in a timely and cost effective manner  migrating the company s data center from newark  california to pleasanton  california in the first half of without unexpected delays or interruption in system availability  achieving and maintaining targeted levels of productivity and efficiency in its distribution centers  obtaining acceptable new store locations  competitive pressures in the apparel industry  changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel or home related merchandise  changes in geopolitical and general economic conditions  unseasonable weather trends  disruptions in supply chain  lower than planned gross margin and greater than planned operating costs  the company s ability to continue to purchase attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts  the company s ability to identify and successfully enter new geographic markets  and the company s ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies 
the company s corporate headquarters  certain of its distribution centers and of its stores are located in california 
therefore  a downturn in the california economy or a major california natural disaster could significantly affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company s continued success depends  in part  upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations  and to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue growth or profit growth 
future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict

as of january   the company had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and had million of long term debt outstanding which accrues interest at libor plus basis points 
a hypothetical basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as of and for the year ended january  the company does not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material 
the company uses forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices 
the company had no outstanding forward contracts at january
