item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview introduction the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of gray television  inc the company should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview the company derives its revenues primarily from its television broadcasting operations and to a lesser extent  from its newspaper publishing and paging operations 
the operating revenues of the company s television stations are derived from broadcast advertising revenues and  to a much lesser extent  from ancillary services such as production of commercials and tower rentals as well as compensation paid by the networks to the stations for broadcasting network programming 
the operating revenues of the company s newspaper publishing operations are derived from advertising  circulation and classified revenue 
paging revenue is derived primarily from the sale of pagers  cellular telephones and related services 
certain information concerning the relative contributions of the company s television broadcasting  publishing and paging operations is provided in note l 
information on business segments to the company s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
in the company s broadcasting operations  broadcast advertising is sold for placement either preceding or following a television station s network programming and within local and syndicated programming 
broadcast advertising is sold in time increments and is priced primarily on the basis of a program s popularity among the specific audience an advertiser desires to reach  as measured by nielsen 
in addition  broadcast advertising rates are affected by the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the size and demographic makeup of the market served by the station and the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area 
broadcast advertising rates are the highest during the most desirable viewing hours  with corresponding reductions during other hours 
the ratings of a local station affiliated with a major network can be affected by ratings of network programming 
most broadcast advertising contracts are short term  and generally run only for a few weeks 
approximately of the net revenues of the company s television stations for the year ended december   were generated from local advertising including political advertising revenues  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff directly to local accounts  and the remainder represented primarily by national advertising  which is sold by a station s national advertising sales representative 
the stations generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising and the stations also pay commissions to the national sales representative on national advertising 
broadcast advertising revenues are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season 
in addition  broadcast advertising revenues are generally higher during even numbered years due to spending by political candidates  which spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter 
the company has received significant political advertising revenue during the current year 
the company s publishing operations advertising contracts are generally entered into annually and provide for a commitment as to the volume of advertising to be purchased by an advertiser during the year 
the publishing operations advertising revenues are primarily generated from local advertising and are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year 

table of contents the company s paging subscribers either own pagers  thereby paying solely for the use of the company s paging services  or lease pagers  thereby paying a periodic charge for both the pagers and the paging services 
the terms of the lease contracts are month to month  three months  six months or twelve months in duration 
paging revenues are generally equally distributed throughout the year 
the broadcasting operations primary operating expenses are employee compensation  related benefits and programming costs 
the publishing operations primary operating expenses are employee compensation  related benefits and newsprint costs 
the paging operations primary operating expenses are employee compensation and other communications costs 
in addition  the broadcasting  publishing and paging operations incur overhead expenses  such as maintenance  supplies  insurance  rent and utilities 
a large portion of the operating expenses of the broadcasting  publishing and paging operations is fixed  although the company has experienced significant variability in its newsprint costs in recent years 
recent acquisition activity on january   the company completed the acquisition of kkco tv for approximately million plus related transaction costs 
kkco tv  channel serves the grand junction  colorado television market and is an nbc affiliate 
the company used a portion of its cash on hand to fully fund this acquisition 
due to the acquisition of kkco tv occurring in  the operating results of kkco tv are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and included elsewhere herein 
on august   the company completed the acquisition of a federal communications commission fcc television license for wcav tv  channel  in charlottesville  virginia from charlottesville broadcasting corporation 
gray s cost to acquire that fcc license was approximately million

political advertising revenues increased to million from million 
political advertising revenues for primarily reflect the cyclical influence of the presidential election 
excluding political advertising revenues  local broadcasting advertising revenues increased to million from million and national broadcasting advertising revenues remained at million 
we attribute the increases in non political local broadcasting advertising revenues to improved economic conditions and broad based demand for commercial time by local advertisers in the markets in which we operate 
we believe that commercial time used for political advertising limited  in part  the amount of commercial time available for sale by the company to national advertisers during the year ended december  although the company s network compensation increased in the current year  these revenues will decrease in future periods due to the company s new network affiliation contracts which will generate lower revenues in future periods

table of contents valuation of fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements broadcast licenses of television stations acquired by the company prior to january  were valued using a residual basis methodology analogous to goodwill where the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of all identified tangible and intangible assets was attributed to the broadcast license 
the company values the broadcast licenses of any television station acquired after using an income approach 
under this approach  a broadcast license is valued based on analyzing the estimated after tax discounted future cash flows of the station  assuming an initial start up operation maturing into an average performing station in a specific television market and giving consideration to other relevant factors such as the technical qualities of the broadcast license and the number of competing broadcast licenses within that market 
the company adopted this methodology to value broadcast licenses as the company believes this methodology has  in recent years  become the methodology generally used within the broadcast industry to value broadcast licenses 
some broadcast companies may use methods to value acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations different than those that are used by the company 
these different methods may result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets among broadcast companies 
the company believes that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market 
the length of time the broadcast license has allowed a station to operate 
television stations that have been broadcasting within a market for longer periods of time are generally viewed more often than newer television stations 
vhf stations generally channels two to thirteen are typically viewed more often than uhf stations generally channels fifteen to sixty nine because i vhf stations have been broadcasting longer than uhf stations  ii uhf signals are generally weaker than vhf signals and iii because historically  in the early years of uhf operations  uhf stations had disadvantaged channel positions on tv receivers and cable systems compared to vhf stations 
the quality of the broadcast signal and geographic location of the broadcast station within a market impacts viewership 
the viewership of a television station is influenced by a television station s physical location 
as an example  the value of being licensed to the largest city within a multi city market has more value than being licensed to the smallest city within that market 
a station s broadcast power level  antenna height and antenna location all influence the overall quality of a television signal and therefore potential viewership of the station 
all of these attributes are ultimately controlled by the broadcast license issued by the fcc 
the audience acceptance of the broadcast licensee s local news programming and community involvement 
a local television station s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its own network programming 

table of contents the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station s syndicated programming that attracts the largest audiences in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 
a local television station can be the number one station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on these factors or attributes listed above 
abc  cbs  nbc and fox each have affiliations with local television stations that have the largest prime time audience in the local market in which the station operates 
some broadcasting companies account for network affiliations as a significant component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that stations are popular because they have generally been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcast companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
in connection with the company s purchase of gray midamerica television in october and of kolo tv in december the company acquired television stations serving markets 
the methodology the company used to value these stations was based on the company s evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
the company believes that in these specific markets the company would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to the television station 
the company bases this belief in part on the following of the markets that these newly acquired stations operate in  of these markets have four or fewer commercial television stations including the station owned by the company 
in the remaining four markets  the company s stations operate on vhf channels  see the discussion of vhf channels below 
also  in those four remaining markets the company s stations all rank among the top three most viewed stations in the market for both local news viewing and for overall viewing of programming  see the discussion of audience viewing below 
the company defines a commercial television station as a commercial broadcast station that bia has reported receiving at least a share of viewers  or more  in three of the four most recent rating periods 
of these stations  the average length of time the broadcast license has allowed these stations to operate is years with the shortest time period being years and the longest time period being years 
generally  networks desire to affiliate with established stations that have performed at a high level over time 
each of the stations acquired in have been continuously affiliated with at least one of the following major networks  abc  cbs or nbc  for substantially all of the years the respective station has been broadcasting and have been consistently affiliated with the same major network on average for years with the shortest time period being years and the longest time period being years 
of these stations  stations broadcast on vhf channels and three stations broadcast on uhf channels 
in the three markets in which the company broadcasts on a uhf channel  there are four or fewer commercial television stations including the station owned by the company in the market see the discussion of the number of stations in a market above 
of these markets  two are considered by the company to be multi city markets and each of the company s station s are licensed to the largest city within the multi city market 
generally  a network would rather affiliate with a station that is licensed to the largest city within a multi city 
table of contents market  because there are likely to be more viewers interested in the local news product of that station in comparison to stations licensed to smaller cities within the same market 
all stations broadcast using power levels  antenna heights and antenna locations that produce high quality television signals that cover large geographic areas 
within these markets  each of the company s stations rank among the top three viewed stations in each market for both local news and also for overall programming 
more specifically  of the stations  the stations local news programming ranking and the stations overall audience ranking within the station s market was number one or two at of the stations and number three at three of the stations 
the stations that have a number three ranking are all in a single market and operate as a parent station with two satellite stations to better service smaller towns geographically distant from the primary station 
these audience rankings are based upon the company s review of market data for the november  july  may and february rating periods 
given the company s assumptions and the specific attributes of the stations the company acquired in see discussion above  the company ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation relationship in each market beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms of the affiliation agreement that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
certain other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operational performance of that station 
as a result  the company believes that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that the company believes are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
if the company were to assign higher values to all of its network affiliations and less value to its broadcast licenses and if it is further assumed that such higher values of the network affiliations are definite lived intangible assets  this reallocation of value might have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
however  it should be noted that there is a diversity of practice and some broadcast companies have considered such an intangible asset to have a life ranging from to years depending on the specific assumptions utilized by those broadcast companies 
the following table reflects the hypothetical impact of the hypothetical reassignment of value from broadcast licenses to network affiliations for all prior acquisitions of the company the first acquisition being in and the resulting increase in amortization expense assuming a hypothetical year amortization period

in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from the values of previous acquisitions due to the different characteristics of each station and the market in which it operates 
income taxes the company has approximately million in federal operating loss carryforwards  which expire during the years through additionally  the company has an aggregate of approximately million of various state operating loss carryforwards 
the utilization of a significant portion of the net operating losses is limited on an annual basis due to a change in ownership of both the company and gray midamerica television 
management does not believe that these limitations will significantly impact the company s ability to utilize the federal net operating losses before they expire 
limitations on utilization may apply to approximately million of certain state operating loss carryforwards 
accordingly  a valuation allowance has been provided to account for the potential limitations on utilization of certain state tax benefits 
recent accounting pronouncements valuation of intangible assets at the september meeting of the emerging issues task force eitf  the securities and exchange commission the sec observer clarified the sec staff s position on the use of the residual method for valuation of acquired assets other than goodwill which is referred to as topic d the sec staff believes that the residual method does not comply with the requirements of sfas no 
when used to value certain intangible assets that arise from legal or contractual rights 
accordingly  the sec staff believes that the residual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill 
registrants should apply the income approach to such assets acquired in business combinations completed after september   and registrants who have applied the residual method to the 
table of contents valuation of intangible assets for the purpose of impairment testing shall perform an impairment test using an income approach on all intangible assets that were previously valued using the residual method no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after december  impairment of intangible assets recognized upon application of an income approach  including the associated deferred tax effects  should be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
early adoption of an income approach is encouraged 
as mentioned above  television broadcast licenses acquired by the company prior to january  were valued using the residual value methodology 
effective january   the company will adopt the provisions of this announcement and perform a valuation assessment of its federal communication commission licenses using the income approach 
the company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the change in accounting principal 
however  based on preliminary valuation analysis reports from an independent third party  the company does not expect that the adoption of this pronouncement will require the company to record an impairment charge in the first quarter of share based payment in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the company is currently evaluating sfas r to determine which fair value based model and transitional provision it will follow upon adoption 
the options for transition methods as prescribed in sfas r include either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective methods 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock as the requisite service is rendered beginning with the first quarter of adoption  while the modified retrospective method would record compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
under the modified retrospective method  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
sfas r will be effective for the company beginning in its third quarter of fiscal although the company will continue to evaluate the application of sfas r  based on options issued and outstanding at present  the company expects that the expense will be between  and  for the year ended december  american jobs creation act of on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk based on the company s floating rate debt outstanding at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would increase the company s interest expense and decrease the company s income before income taxes for the year by approximately million 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt at december  was approximately million  which was approximately million more than its carrying value 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in the prevailing interest rates at december  would result in an increase in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair market values are determined from quoted market prices where available or based on estimates made by investment bankers
