item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction for a description of k tron s business  refer to item of part i of this annual report on form k 
as indicated in item  we are engaged in one principal business segment material handling equipment and systems 
we operate in two primary geographic locations north and south america the americas and europe  the middle east  africa and asia emea asia 
we have three main business or product lines business lines within the material handling equipment and systems segment 
they are  in descending order of revenues in  our feeding  size reduction and pneumatic conveying business lines 
during  our customers increased capital equipment spending following spending that had been depressed due to the global economic slowdown and excess manufacturing capacity built up in the late s  particularly in the us processing industries 
bookings increased in versus in all three of our business lines as a result of improved economic conditions 
management looks at trends in what it believes to be relevant indicators  such as the pmi index for manufacturing published by the institute of supply management and similar foreign indices  to help it better understand the prospects for capital equipment spending  particularly as it may affect our feeder and pneumatic conveying equipment business lines 
these indicators began to show improvement in the latter part of  and this was reflected in higher bookings by our k tron feeder group beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout historically  increases in our feeding equipment sales generally lag improvements in these indicators  in some cases by as much as six to twelve months 
we believe that our k tron feeder group is the global leader in the design  production  marketing and servicing of high quality industrial feeders for the handling of bulk solids in a wide variety of manufacturing processes 
the majority of the revenues and profits of our k tron feeder group is generated by equipment and systems sales  with a lesser amount attributable to service  parts and repairs 
new product innovation is a major objective of the r d efforts of this business 
our k tron feeder group has the ability to serve nearly all geographic regions of the world from its two assembly and test facilities in pitman  new jersey and niederlenz  switzerland 
our size reduction business line was added with the purchase of penn crusher and jeffrey on january  in contrast to our feeding line  penn crusher and jeffrey sell equipment primarily into the us market  with some sales into china and other foreign countries 
the main industries served are the electric utility  mining  pulp and paper and wood and forest products industries  and a majority of revenues and profits are generated from replacement part sales instead of new equipment 
both penn crusher and jeffrey maintain an extensive digital database of previously sold equipment  including equipment specifications and drawings  which enables them to respond quickly and efficiently to fill customers spare parts orders 
our size reduction business line saw an increase in bookings in following a modest decline in that resulted from lower economic activity  excess plant capacity and financial restructuring and credit issues in the power industry 
significant indicators that management uses to judge prospects for this business line in the united states include the level of electricity consumption  the financial health of the electric utility industry and the demand for paper and forest products 

table of contents our pneumatic conveying line comprises a relatively small portion of our overall revenues 
this equipment is sometimes sold through the k tron feeder group in conjunction with feeder equipment as a means of transporting a dry material from one part of a plant to the inlet of a feeder  and the companies in the pneumatic conveying group also sell equipment and complete systems in applications which do not necessarily incorporate feeders  primarily in the united kingdom 
aside from selling into markets common to the feeder line  the pneumatic conveying group also sells into the plastics injection molding market 
most of the revenues and profits of this line are generated from equipment and systems sales 
factors affecting the pneumatic conveying line are similar to those which affect the feeder line but also include factors that may affect the secondary plastics market generally 
in  the pneumatic conveying business line benefited from a large order from a customer for a specially designed piece of equipment 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the fiscal years ended january   january  and december  critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in certain areas 
areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include determinations of the useful life of assets  estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts  valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  estimates of the realizability of deferred tax assets  determinations of the adequacy of reserves for inventory obsolescence and warranty costs  and legal contingencies 
there are a number of critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
we base our critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that the most critical assumptions made in arriving at our accounting estimates are the following depreciable lives of plant and equipment each asset included in plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  which deducts equal amounts of the cost of such asset from earnings every year over such asset s estimated economic useful life 
net plant and equipment at year end totaled  which represented of total assets 
depreciation expense during totaled  which represented of total operating expenses 
given the significance of plant and equipment and associated depreciation to our financial statements  the determination of an asset s economic useful life is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 

table of contents economic useful life is the duration of time the asset is expected to be productively employed by the company  which may be less than its physical life 
management s assumptions regarding the following factors  among others  affect the determination of estimated economic useful life changes in technology  wear and tear and changes in market demand 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its continued appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  technological advances  excessive wear and tear or reduced estimates of future demand for a product may result in a shorter estimated useful life for an asset than originally anticipated 
in such a case  we would depreciate the remaining net book value of the asset over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
conversely  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life would decrease depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
over the past three years  changes in economic useful life assumptions have not had a material impact on our reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
we record a provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate provision  management analyzes the creditworthiness of specific customers and the aging of customer balances 
management also considers contractual rights and obligations and general and industry specific economic conditions 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to establish the allowance can change from time to time  and uncollectible accounts could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations 
asset impairment determinations as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized 
under this accounting standard  goodwill is subject to an impairment test that we conduct at least annually using a discounted cash flow technique 
the impairment test done in indicated that the fair value of the business with goodwill exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  the goodwill amount was not impaired 
with respect to our other long lived assets  we are required to test for asset impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset has been impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
in analyzing the future cash flows of various assets  the assumptions we make include the following the intended use of assets and the expected cash flows resulting directly from such use industry specific economic conditions 
table of contents customer preferences and behavior patterns the impact of applicable regulatory initiatives  if any we believe that an accounting estimate relating to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to change from time to time and the recognition of an impairment could have a significant impact on our income statement 
over the past three years  we have not recognized any asset impairments 
income taxes we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of liabilities and assets measured using the enacted tax rate 
income tax expense was  for the year ended significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable tax contingency in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the utilization of part of the contingency is discussed later in this item in results of operations 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 
deferred tax assets are recorded for deductible temporary differences  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when there are insufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of these items  these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense 
a one percentage point increase in the company s effective tax rate for from to would have decreased reported net income by approximately  inventory obsolescence we record an inventory obsolescence reserve for obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
in calculating our inventory obsolescence reserve  management analyzes historical data regarding customer demand  product changes  market conditions and assumptions about future product demand 
management believes that its accounting estimate related to inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because customer demand can be variable and changes in our reserve for inventory obsolescence could materially affect our financial results 
warranty reserve we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
warranty expense is normally accrued as a percentage of sales on a monthly basis  and this provision is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
there is an exception to this for certain products within the size reduction business for which we use a combination of historical information and 
table of contents management judgment 
we offer a one year product warranty on a majority of our products 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including the active monitoring and evaluation of the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by actual product failures and by material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
our warranty provision is established based upon our best estimates of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty provisions are adequate and that the judgments applied are appropriate  the ultimate cost of product warranty could differ materially from our estimates 
when the actual cost of warranty of our products is lower than we originally anticipated  we adjust downward the recorded reserve  and if the cost of warranty repairs and service is higher than anticipated  we increase the reserve 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
this estimate has been developed by management and may be made in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and also with our insurance consultant  and it is based upon an analysis of potential results  including litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by litigation outcomes that are significantly different than our assumptions and estimates 
results of operations overview fiscal was a week year  while fiscal was a week year and fiscal was a week year 
in  and  we reported revenues of   and  and net income of   and  we believe that the increases in our revenues and net income compared to were primarily the result of improved business conditions and increased spending for capital equipment by customers in many of the markets served by our business lines 
an additional favorable factor was the effect of the weaker us dollar in versus on the translation of the revenues and profits of our foreign operations into us dollars 
our effective tax rate was  down from in due primarily to the impact of a  fourth quarter tax benefit resulting from the reduction of a previously established tax reserve following the settlement and closure of a tax audit in germany  partially offset by a higher proportion of us income which is taxed at higher rates 
net income for also benefited from a  pre tax profit contribution from the first quarter sale of an office building by one of our united kingdom subsidiaries 
the significant revenue increase over was due to the january  acquisition of penn crusher  partly offset by a decline in revenues from the other parts of our business reflecting a poor global economy and weakness during much of in capital equipment spending in the process industries we serve 
the improvement in net income in versus was also due to the acquisition of penn crusher  partly offset by lower profits in the k tron feeder group as a result of the weak global economy and the reduced capital equipment spending previously mentioned 

table of contents acquisitions on january   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of penn crusher 
as a result of this purchase  we also acquired jeffrey  a wholly owned subsidiary of penn crusher 
the purchase price for the penn crusher stock was  paid at closing  a post closing adjustment of  based on penn crusher s consolidated stockholders equity at december  and  in the quarter ended january  in conjunction with the company s irs code section h election relating to such acquisition 
of this amount   was paid in cash and  was in unsecured promissory notes which were payable in equal  annual installments on january of  and with respect to the payment of the cash portion of the purchase price and related acquisition costs other than the section h election  we financed  through a  secured credit facility with penn crusher as the borrower and jeffrey as the guarantor with the additional  being available for working capital and general corporate purposes  subject to certain limitations  and the lender has no recourse against any other k tron company with respect to any amounts borrowed thereunder except by a non recourse pledge of the stock of penn crusher 
additionally  we borrowed  from a us bank through the us manufacturing subsidiary of the k tron feeder group and used these funds to pay part of the purchase price 
this obligation was guaranteed by k tron international  and k tron international also issued the  of unsecured promissory notes 
in june  k tron international  inc prepaid the  of unsecured promissory notes bearing interest at per annum that were payable to the former penn crusher stockholders 
the prepayment of the notes was financed with a  term loan from a us bank  repayable over months  with monthly principal payments of  which began in january  monthly principal payments of  beginning january and a final principal payment of  in december interest is payable monthly at a fixed rate of on principal of  and at a variable rate of one month libor plus as of january  on the remaining principal of  the term loan is guaranteed by the us manufacturing subsidiary of the k tron feeder group 
as noted above  k tron and penn crusher incurred substantial debt as a result of the penn crusher acquisition 
this debt  including the amounts outstanding at the end of  is described in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section of this item k tron and penn crusher have met all required principal and interest payments on this debt  and in penn crusher also made a  principal prepayment on one of the term loans included as part of its secured credit facility 
foreign exchange rates we are an international company  and we derived approximately  and of our  and revenues from products manufactured in  and services performed from  our facilities located outside the united states  primarily in europe 
with our global operations  we are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange rates  which can affect both the translation of financial statement items into us dollars as well as transactions where the revenues and related expenses may initially be accounted for in different currencies  such as sales made from our swiss manufacturing facility in currencies other than the swiss franc 
with the acquisition of penn crusher and jeffrey  we were less affected in and by foreign exchange rates since most of their sales are in us dollars 
nevertheless  we still derive substantial revenues from products manufactured in  and services performed from  our facilities outside the united states  so that we will continue to have significant sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes 

table of contents since we have received substantial revenues in recent years from activities in foreign jurisdictions  our results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates  particularly in us dollar exchange rates with respect to the swiss franc  euro and british pound sterling and  to a lesser degree  the singapore dollar and other currencies 
when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based sales increases 
when the non us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of us dollar based sales decreases 
correspondingly  the us dollar value of us dollar based costs increases when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens 
overall  our revenues in us dollars generally benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide  especially those identified above 
in particular  a general weakening of the us dollar against other currencies would positively affect our revenues  gross profit and operating income as expressed in us dollars provided that the gross profit and operating income numbers from foreign operations are not losses  since in the case of a loss  the effect would be to increase the loss  whereas a general strengthening of the us dollar against such currencies would have the opposite effect 
in addition  our revenues and income with respect to particular sales transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility manufacturing the product subject to the sale 
for  and  the changes in certain key foreign exchange rates affecting the company were as follows fiscal year average us dollar equivalent of one swiss franc change vs 
prior year average us dollar equivalent of one euro change vs 
prior year average us dollar equivalent of one british pound sterling change vs 
prior year average swiss franc equivalent of one euro change vs 
prior year average swiss franc equivalent of one british pound sterling change vs 
prior year 
table of contents presentation of results and analysis the following table sets forth our results of operations  expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated  as well as our year end backlogs fiscal year total revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating income interest expense gain on sale of office building income before income taxes year end backlog at year end foreign exchange rates  in thousands of dollars total revenues increased by  or in compared to we believe that these increases were primarily attributable to improved business conditions which resulted in increased capital equipment spending by our customers in many of the markets served by our business lines feeding  size reduction and pneumatic conveying and  to a lesser degree  to the positive effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of the revenues of our foreign operations into us dollars 
the favorable impact of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately  or  of the  revenue increase in compared to total revenues increased by  or in compared to this increase was due to the acquisition of penn crusher on january   which contributed revenues of  and the positive effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of the revenues of our foreign operations into us dollars  partly offset by a decline in revenues in our other businesses as a result of a weaker global economy  a reduction in spending for industrial capital equipment in the process industries we serve and the effects of the sars outbreak in asia in the early part of if the average foreign exchange rates for were applied to  total revenues for would have increased by  or versus the  and on an as reported basis 
gross profit as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in the increase reflected a change in the sales mix of the material handling products sold within our three business lines 
sales mix refers to the relative amounts of different products sold and services provided 
gross margin levels vary with the product sold or service provided 
for example  sales of replacement parts in the size reduction business line generally carry a higher gross margin than do sales of equipment within that line 
gross profit as a percent of total revenues decreased to in from in the decline was caused by a change in sales mix of the material handling products sold within our 
table of contents business lines 
as a result of the acquisition of penn crusher at the beginning of  the overall sales mix in included  for the first time  size reduction equipment which carried lower margins compared with much of the other equipment sold by the company 
thus  overall margins for were lower than those in when there were no size reduction equipment sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  or in compared to this increase was primarily the result of a higher employee bonus accrual  higher sales commissions related to increased revenues  the effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of foreign costs into us dollars  and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the implementation of new software systems by the k tron feeder group 
sg a expenses increased by  or in compared to this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of penn crusher in and  to a much lesser extent  selected employee termination costs that were not part of any specific restructuring plan in the k tron feeder group 
in addition  sg a increased as a result of the adverse effect of a weaker us dollar when translating costs in foreign currencies into us dollars 
research and development r d expense decreased by  or in compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower prototype expenditures and a small reduction in staff  partially offset by the effect of a weaker us dollar when translating swiss r d costs into us dollars 
r d expenditures increased by  or in compared to  primarily as a result of increased tooling costs as well as the effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of swiss franc costs into us dollars 
r d expense as a percent of total revenues was in  in and in there was no significant r d expense associated with the penn crusher and jeffrey businesses 
interest expense decreased by  or in as compared to this decrease was the result of lower debt levels in  partially offset by increased interest rates in interest expense increased by  or in as compared to this increase was largely the result of adding  of acquisition debt for penn crusher in january plus  to a much lesser degree  foreign exchange rates a weaker us dollar applicable to interest paid in other currencies 
further information regarding the penn crusher acquisition debt is presented in the liquidity and capital resources section of this item the increased interest expense was somewhat offset by lower interest rates in on the non penn crusher related debt compared with interest rates and by debt reductions of  in switzerland  at the foreign exchange rate at the end of and  in the united states 
in the first quarter of  one of our united kingdom subsidiaries sold its office building for  and realized a pre tax gain of  all employees were relocated to a nearby office building that is leased by another united kingdom subsidiary 
income before income taxes was  in   in and  in the changes during the periods were the net result of the items discussed above 
the income before income taxes was substantially higher than in primarily because of improved business conditions in many of the markets served by our business lines and  to a lesser extent  from the positive effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of the revenues and profits of our foreign 
table of contents operations into us dollars 
the income before income taxes improved versus due to the penn crusher acquisition 
the  and provisions for income tax were   and  and the overall effective tax rates were in  in and in the lower effective tax rate in compared with was primarily due to the impact of a tax benefit of  resulting from the fourth quarter reduction of a previously established tax reserve following the settlement and closure of a tax audit in germany  partially offset by a higher proportion of us income 
the higher effective tax rate in compared with was primarily due to the acquisition of penn crusher and the resulting higher proportion of us income 
on july   new jersey approved legislation for corporation income tax reform 
the changes made to the law accounted for an increase in the tax provision for  and of approximately   and  after the related federal income tax benefit 
we have foreign and us state tax loss carryforwards that total  and  which  if realized  would have an estimated future net income benefit of approximately  and  we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations during the last three years 
our backlog at constant foreign exchange rates increased by  or at the end of compared with year end  from  to  our backlog at constant foreign exchange rates increased by  or at the end of compared with year end  from  to  of this increase  approximately or  was attributable to the addition of the penn crusher and jeffrey businesses 
the remainder of the backlog increase was largely due to the emea asia feeder business 
a significant part of our backlog at the end of consisted of orders that were expected to be shipped within days 
approximately  of the penn crusher backlog at the end of was for blanket orders that can be released by the customer at any time over an month period 
liquidity and capital resources penn crusher acquisition debt to finance the penn crusher acquisition described earlier  we borrowed  from two us banks  and we also issued  in unsecured promissory notes to the penn crusher stockholders 
we borrowed  from a us bank through the us manufacturing subsidiary of the k tron feeder group  which loan was combined with an outstanding term loan from that bank to that subsidiary and resulted in a new  term loan 
monthly principal payments of  plus interest at a fixed rate of on approximately half the loan and at a variable rate of one month libor plus on the other half at january  began in february  with the final principal payment of approximately  plus interest being due in january this loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the us manufacturing subsidiary and is guaranteed by k tron international  inc at january   there was  outstanding under this term loan facility 
the term loan facility requires that k tron international comply with certain covenants relating to the consolidated debt to net worth ratio  minimum annual debt coverage and minimum net worth 
penn crusher borrowed  from another us bank consisting of  in term debt  with a five year term and  with a six year term and  under a five year revolving credit facility 
subject to certain conditions  the revolving credit facility 
table of contents provides for up to  of total availability  including the  originally borrowed thereunder 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of january  quarterly term debt principal payments of  began march  and increase each year by  per quarter or  per year in the aggregate through december   with final quarterly principal payments of  in in december  we prepaid  that was due in of the  term debt 
interest is based on one to six month libor plus to  and the to was reduced to to upon meeting certain financial ratios 
as of january   there was  outstanding on the five year term loan and  outstanding on the six year term loan 
in january  penn crusher entered into an interest rate swap related to the entire  five year term loan  as of january  such that interest cannot exceed for the full term of the loan and this limit was reduced to in upon meeting certain financial ratios 
the interest rates on the outstanding balances under the  term loan and the  term loan were and as of january  the penn crusher debt is guaranteed by jeffrey and secured by substantially all of the assets of penn crusher and jeffrey  but it is not guaranteed by any other k tron company except by a non recourse pledge of the stock of penn crusher 
the term loans and revolving credit facility require that penn crusher comply with certain covenants relating to tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio and total debt to ebitda ratio 
in addition  k tron international issued  of unsecured promissory notes to the former penn crusher stockholders as part of the penn crusher purchase price 
these notes were payable in three equal  annual installments beginning january on the second  third and fourth anniversaries of the january  closing date 
interest at per annum was payable quarterly 
in june  k tron international prepaid the  of unsecured promissory notes that were payable to the former penn crusher stockholders 
the prepayment of these notes was financed with a  term loan from a us bank  repayable over months  with monthly principal payments of  beginning january  monthly principal payments of  beginning january and a final principal payment of  in december interest is payable monthly at a fixed rate of per annum on principal of  and a variable rate of one month libor plus as of january  on the remaining principal of  the term loan is guaranteed by the us manufacturing subsidiary of the k tron feeder group 
other bank debt at january   our swiss subsidiary had separate credit facilities totaling  swiss francs approximately  with three swiss banks 
the company s real property in switzerland is pledged as collateral 
as of january   there were no borrowings under any of these credit facilities 
in june  the us manufacturing subsidiary of the k tron feeder group refinanced its year mortgage debt with a us bank for  at an annual interest rate of 
in july  the annual interest rate was reduced to and  beginning august   this loan became repayable in eighty three monthly principal and interest payments of  each  with a final payment of  plus interest due on august  as of january   the principal amount owed on this borrowing was also in june  this same us manufacturing subsidiary entered into a two year secured revolving credit facility with the us bank that holds the mortgage 
as of january   there was  borrowed under this credit facility  which has now been extended through july  and  was available for future borrowings 
the annual interest rate as of january  was

other items at the end of and  our working capital was  and  and the ratio of our current assets to our current liabilities was and 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in cash from operating activities throughout and also from the sale of our uk office building in the first quarter of in and  we utilized internally generated funds and our lines of credit to meet our working capital needs 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in   in and  in the increase in operating cash flow in compared to was primarily due to increases in net income  depreciation and amortization  accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
most of the changes resulted from the stronger business conditions and higher revenues discussed above 
net cash from operations declined in versus as a result of increases in inventories and accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in net income and depreciation and amortization

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks related to i fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and ii interest rate changes 

table of contents foreign exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the swiss franc  the us dollar versus the euro  the us dollar versus the british pound sterling  the swiss franc versus the euro and the swiss franc versus the british pound sterling 
we do not  as a routine matter  use hedging vehicles to manage foreign exchange exposures 
foreign currency debt is used as necessary in switzerland and the united kingdom where the company does business  thereby reducing our net asset value exposure 
in addition  foreign cash balances in currencies other than the swiss franc are limited in order to manage the transaction exposure caused by the marking to market of non swiss franc balances to swiss franc values on the balance sheet of our swiss subsidiary 
as of january   a unfavorable change in the foreign exchange rates affecting balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a reduction in pre tax earnings of approximately  this hypothetical reduction on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the january  actual foreign exchange rates and hypothetical rates assuming a unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates on that date 
the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as translation adjustments ta within shareholders equity on the balance sheet 
using the example above  the hypothetical change in ta would be calculated by multiplying the net assets of our non us operations by a unfavorable change in the applicable foreign exchange rates 
the result of this calculation would be to reduce shareholders equity by approximately  or of our january  shareholders equity of interest rate risk we have several credit facilities or loans that require us to pay interest at a rate that may change periodically 
these variable rate obligations expose us to the risk of increased interest expense if short term interest rates rise 
we limit our exposure to increased interest expense from rising short term interest rates by including in our debt portfolio various amounts of fixed rate debt as well as by the use of an interest rate swap 
as of year end  we had total debt of   of which was fixed rate debt  approximately  of which was subject to variable interest rates which ranged from to and  of which was variable rate debt subject to an interest rate swap with the result that the interest rate was fixed at  subject to possible reduction 
this rate was reduced in to after we achieved a targeted debt to ebitda ratio 
a basis point increase in interest rates on the  of variable rate debt would increase annual interest expense by approximately
